Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your tax bracket, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching. This can provide immediate tax benefits and compound growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. If you're more certain you'll be in a lower bracket, a traditional IRA might be better for tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income (like dividends or interest) if youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on long-term investments to minimize capital gains tax.

4. **Asset Location**: Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure diversification across all accounts to mitigate risks.
