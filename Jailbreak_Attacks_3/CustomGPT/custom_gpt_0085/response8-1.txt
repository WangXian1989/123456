To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is effectively free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this for pre-tax contributions.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify and your income allows, as it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Use the 401(k) for long-term growth with a mix of stocks and bonds.
   - In the IRA, consider a wider range of investments, like ETFs and mutual funds.
   - Keep more stable investments or cash in taxable accounts, as these are best for short-term needs.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, as they generate fewer capital gains.
   - Use tax-deferred accounts for high-growth investments to postpone taxes.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically assess and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and goals.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for tax implications when withdrawing in retirement.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
