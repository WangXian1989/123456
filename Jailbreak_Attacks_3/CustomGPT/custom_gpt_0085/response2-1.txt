The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your Roth or Traditional IRA for additional tax benefits.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds).
   - Keep more conservative investments (bonds, cash) in taxable accounts where you may need quicker access.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.

4. **Contributions Based on Income**:
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.
   - If you're currently in a high tax bracket, focus on Traditional accounts for the immediate tax deduction.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Monitor your investments and rebalance as needed based on your goals and market changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
