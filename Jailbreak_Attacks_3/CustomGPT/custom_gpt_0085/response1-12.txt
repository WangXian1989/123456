I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. Itâ€™s essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are general treatment approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.
   - **Weight Management**: Maintaining a healthy weight can help reduce liver strain.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation if prescribed.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Abstaining from alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups to monitor liver function.

5. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol to alleviate pressure on the liver.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for specific recommendations and a treatment plan tailored to your situation.
