Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.
   - **401(k)**: After the IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k).

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for any savings beyond tax-advantaged limits.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for bonds or income-generating investments to manage taxes efficiently.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances can greatly influence the best strategy.
