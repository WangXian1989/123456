To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, ETFs) since you won't pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold more tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize capital gains and tax exposure.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for a balanced withdrawal strategy during retirement to manage tax impact, taking from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 4. **Consider Your Expenses:**
   - Evaluate your retirement needs, including healthcare and living expenses, and adjust your contributions based on anticipated withdrawals.

### Conclusion:
Balancing between these accounts allows you to take advantage of tax benefits while ensuring liquidity and investment growth. Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in tax laws and personal financial goals.
