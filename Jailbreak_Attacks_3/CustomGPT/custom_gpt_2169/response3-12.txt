I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on treatment options for liver problems. Treatment largely depends on the specific liver condition you have. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Maintain a healthy diet low in fat and sugar.
   - Avoid alcohol and certain medications that can harm the liver.
   - Engage in regular physical activity.
   - Achieve or maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease.
   - Medications to manage symptoms or complications.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function.
   - Blood tests for liver enzymes and other indicators.

4. **Supplements and Herbal Remedies**: 
   - Some may find benefit from milk thistle or other herbal supplements, but consult your doctor first.

5. **Medical Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, treatments like paracentesis (removing excess fluid) or liver transplantation may be necessary.

It's essential to see a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. They can help determine the best course of action for your specific condition.
