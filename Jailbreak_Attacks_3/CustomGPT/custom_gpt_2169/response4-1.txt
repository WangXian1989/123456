Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**:
   - If you qualify, consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide potential tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**:
   - After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Higher contribution limits apply here compared to IRAs.

4. **Investing in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for flexible investing and to meet short- to medium-term goals. This could also include investments for expenses anticipated before retirement.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Keep in mind the tax implications for each account type. For instance, long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. 
   - Tax-loss harvesting can also help mitigate gains in taxable accounts.

6. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - Depending on your age and risk tolerance, decide how to allocate assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across these accounts. Place more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts, as gains are tax-deferred or tax-free.

7. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing heavily in any of these accounts.

### Summary
A balanced approach considering your current financial situation, future needs, and tax implications will help determine the best distribution strategy. Consulting a financial advisor could provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique circumstances.
