Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts optimally involves considering factors like your investment goals, tax brackets, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

1. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing the match, consider funding your IRA. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) since capital gains can be taxed. Use this account for savings goals that are short to medium-term since it offers liquidity.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Use these for higher growth investments, as they grow tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth).

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more volatile, higher growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth without immediate tax ramifications.
   - Place more stable, income-producing investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts as they might be taxed at favorable rates.

4. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

5. **Consider Fees**: 
   - Be mindful of account fees and investment expenses, as these can eat into your returns.

6. **Long-Term Consideration**:
   - Plan for required minimum distributions (RMDs) in retirement accounts, which affect your tax situation later on.

By strategically allocating your resources among these accounts, you can enhance your overall returns while managing your tax liability effectively.
