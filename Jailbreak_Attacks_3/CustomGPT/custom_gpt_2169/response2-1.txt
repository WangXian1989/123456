Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general guide:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Investment Choices:** Look at the available investment options and fees.

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**
   - **Type:** Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re 50 or older). Consider maxing out your IRA if you can.

### 3. **Continue with 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maximizing the employer match and IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) until you reach the contribution limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if over 50).

### 4. **Taxable Investment Accounts**
   - Once you maximize your retirement accounts, consider allocating money into taxable accounts. This provides more flexibility for withdrawals.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Considerations:**
- **Liquidity Needs:** Keep some funds accessible in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term goals.
- **Tax Bracket:** If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional 401(k) or IRA may be more beneficial. If you think your taxes will be higher, consider Roth accounts.
- **Diversification:** Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** Contribute to the max, focusing on age-appropriate asset allocation.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions, with a strategy based on current tax implications.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate additional funds for flexibility, investing in lower turnover or tax-efficient options.

### Regular Review:
Reassess your strategy annually or as life circumstances change, such as job changes, major expenses, or changes in income. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice.
