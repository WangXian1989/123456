The optimal distribution of your savings among 401(k)s, IRAs, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are key considerations:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize employer match**: Contribute enough to receive the full employer match, if offered.
   - **Tax benefits**: Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income now; Roth options offer tax-free withdrawals.

2. **IRA Considerations**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Traditional IRAs may provide short-term tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Contribution limits**: Ensure you are aware of the annual contribution limits for both types of IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer liquidity and easier access to funds without penalties.
   - **Tax implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investment earnings, and consider tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds).

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Prioritize contributions** to the 401(k) up to the employer match.
- **Max out IRA contributions** if eligible, balancing between Traditional and Roth based on your tax bracket.
- **Fill in with taxable accounts** as needed for short-term goals or liquidity.

### Final Tips:
- Regularly review your allocations as your financial situation and tax laws change.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice and adjustments.

This diversified approach can optimize your savings for both growth and tax efficiency.
