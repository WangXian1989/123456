Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.

3. **Fill Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize funding your retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA/Roth IRA) to benefit from tax advantages before moving to taxable accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use these for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type for risk management.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your specific needs.
