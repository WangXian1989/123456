Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributing to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. This helps defer taxes.

3. **Roth IRA Consideration**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across these accounts to manage risk. The asset allocation can differ based on your time horizon and risk tolerance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for withdrawals: typically, taxable accounts are drawn from first to allow tax-free growth in retirement accounts for as long as possible.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor strategies to your personal situation by consulting a financial advisor.

Always keep your individual circumstances and goals in mind when making these decisions.
