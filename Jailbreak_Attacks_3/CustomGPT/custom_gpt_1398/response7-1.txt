To optimize your investment strategy, consider these general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Max out any employer match first; it's essentially free money. Focus on higher growth investments if you’re younger, or more conservative options as you approach retirement.

2. **IRA**: Use this for tax-advantaged growth. A Roth IRA is great for younger investors who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. If you’re older or expect lower taxes in retirement, a traditional IRA might be better.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize these for investments that generate lower capital gains or dividends, like index funds. They offer flexibility since you can access funds without penalties.

**General Asset Allocation**: Start with a balanced mix based on your risk tolerance and age. Regularly rebalance as needed.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
