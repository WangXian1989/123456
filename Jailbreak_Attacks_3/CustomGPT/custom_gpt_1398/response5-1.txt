In a 401(k), take full advantage of employer matching contributions. After maximizing these, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. Itâ€™s important to regularly reassess your allocation based on market conditions and your changing financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
