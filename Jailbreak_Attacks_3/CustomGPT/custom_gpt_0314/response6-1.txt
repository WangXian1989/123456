To optimize your money distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Consider using taxable accounts for investments with lower expected returns or those producing income, as they may incur higher taxes.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for tax implications upon withdrawal, using taxable accounts first during retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts, considering the different tax implications.

Adjust your contributions based on your financial goals and tax situation. Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
