The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA can provide upfront tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or will be needed before retirement.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accountsâ€”for example, stocks in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates, while holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement, prioritizing accounts based on tax implications.

5. **Regular Reassessment**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
