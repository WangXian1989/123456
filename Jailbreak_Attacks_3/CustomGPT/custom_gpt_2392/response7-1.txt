Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax considerations, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here’s a simple approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money. Maximize contributions if your employer offers a good range of investment options.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions now and tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Investment Strategy**
   - **High-Growth Assets**: Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth without immediate tax implications.
   - **Bonds and Income-Producing Assets**: Consider holding these in taxable accounts for potentially favorable tax treatment.

### 3. **Consider Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account or similar, separate from your investment accounts.
   - Assess when you'll need access to the cash; taxable accounts provide the most flexibility.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - Regularly review capital gains taxes on your taxable accounts, and consider tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.
   - Withdrawals from traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income; plan your withdrawal strategy carefully for retirement.

### 5. **Rebalancing Regularly**
   - Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance periodically to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 15%–20% of your total investments (before match).
- **IRA**: 10%–15% of total investments.
- **Taxable Account**: Balance of your investments after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.
