Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential matching contributions and high contribution limits.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages; traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible investment accounts that are taxed on capital gains and dividends, providing access to money without penalties.

### 2. **Strategic Allocation**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
     - If eligible, max out your IRA contributions (both traditional and Roth as per your tax situation).
     - Contribute additional funds to your 401(k) if you have not reached the annual limit after the match.
   - **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
     - Use taxable accounts to hold investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Current and Future Tax Bracket:** If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, traditional accounts may be more beneficial. Conversely, if you anticipate being in a higher bracket, Roth options can be advantageous.
   - **Withdrawal Strategies:** Plan withdrawals from taxable accounts first during retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your target investment strategy.

### 5. **Example Allocation**
   - **Short-term needs:** 10-20% in a taxable account for liquidity.
   - **Mid-term goals:** 20-30% in a mix of tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Long-term retirement savings:** 50-70% focus on maximizing 401(k) and IRA contributions.

### Final Thoughts
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor specific strategies to your financial situation and goals. Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.
