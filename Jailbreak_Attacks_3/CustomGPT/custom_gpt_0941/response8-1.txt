Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including tax implications, investment goals, and your overall financial situation. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After ensuring you get the full match, consider prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your IRA. Depending on your income level, a Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are also tax-deferred; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer tax advantages, so aim to minimize gains to reduce capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Goals**: Clarify your investment horizon:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For short-term goals, use taxable accounts for flexibility, but be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolio across all accounts is well-diversified to manage risk effectively.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Try to make consistent contributions to all accounts to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

7. **Review Annually**: Regularly reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions.

Ultimately, it might be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your unique circumstances and goals.
