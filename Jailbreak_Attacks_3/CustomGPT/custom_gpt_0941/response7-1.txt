Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth. Traditional IRAs can also be beneficial for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use this for money you may need in the short term or for investing in assets that generate less tax liability (like index funds or long-term growth stocks).
   - **401(k) and IRA:** These accounts defer taxes, allowing your investments to grow without immediate tax implications, which can be advantageous for long-term savings.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k):** Focus on a diversified asset allocation based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA:** Similar strategies as your 401(k), but you have more options for investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider strategies that minimize taxes, like harvesting losses or investing in tax-efficient funds.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Typically, you would withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs), and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Review and adjust your allocations regularly to ensure your strategy aligns with your goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion
The best distribution depends on your unique financial picture, so consider speaking with a financial advisor for tailored advice. Balancing these accounts can maximize your retirement savings while minimizing taxes.
