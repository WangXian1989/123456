Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, focus on maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) for additional tax advantages. Roth accounts, in particular, offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: If you can still contribute beyond the IRA limit, continue adding to your 401(k). Higher contribution limits compared to IRAs make this a good option.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've contributed to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This offers more liquidity and access to funds without penalties before retirement age.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals. Typically, younger investors can afford to take more risks (more stocks), while those nearing retirement may want more stability (more bonds).

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Monitor your allocations regularly and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset mix.

7. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of the investments you choose, especially in taxable accounts where capital gains taxes apply.

This approach aims to leverage the benefits of each account type while providing some liquidity through taxable investments. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
