Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as contributions are made with after-tax dollars and withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) until you reach the contribution limit, especially if your employer offers matching.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds, allocate them to taxable accounts. This is useful for short-term goals or if you've maxed out your retirement accounts. 

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks may be better suited for your long-term retirement accounts, while bonds or more liquid assets might be suitable for shorter-term goals.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of how investment income and withdrawals are taxed in each account type. Long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

7. **Reassess Periodically**: Review your allocations regularly to ensure they still align with your goals and adjust as needed based on changes in your life circumstances or market conditions.

It's often helpful to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
