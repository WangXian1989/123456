To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's essentially free money). If possible, max out your contributions for tax savings.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Allocate Based on Goals and Tax Considerations**:
   - **Short-term Goals**: Fund taxable accounts if you need access to cash sooner, as 401(k) and IRA funds are typically locked until retirement age.
   - **Long-term Investments**: Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce tax liabilities.

3. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your investment goals and market conditions. 

Following these strategies can help you maximize your returns while minimizing taxes over time.
