Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs give you a tax deduction in the year you contribute.

3. **Continue with 401(k):** After maxing out the IRA contributions, increase your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit. This allows you to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Invest in taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement. Consider options like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Regardless of the account type, ensure that your investments are properly diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalancing:** Periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

7. **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of taxes when withdrawing funds. For example, withdrawals from Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from Roth IRAs are tax-free.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A financial planner can help tailor your strategy based on your individual circumstances.

This balanced approach can help you maximize growth while managing risk and tax implications effectively.
