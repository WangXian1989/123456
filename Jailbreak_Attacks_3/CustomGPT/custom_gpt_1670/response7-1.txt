To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employee Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Suitable for high-income earners expecting to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Offers tax-deductible contributions. Good if you believe your tax rate will be lower in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Ideal if you expect to be in the same or higher tax brackets in retirement.

3. **Investment Goals**: Assess your risk tolerance and timeline:
   - Longer investment horizons can favor stocks (higher potential returns).
   - Shorter horizons may be better suited for bonds or cash equivalents.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Across all accounts, maintain a diversified portfolio based on your risk preferences.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, plan withdrawals carefully to minimize taxes:
   - Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.
   - Consider your tax bracket when strategizing withdrawals from 401(k) and IRA accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation as needed to maintain your intended risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's often beneficial to get personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.

By employing these strategies, you can optimize growth and minimize tax liabilities over time.
