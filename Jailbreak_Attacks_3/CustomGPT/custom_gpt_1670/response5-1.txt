The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Benefit from tax-deferred growth until retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Strategies**: Choose a Traditional IRA for upfront tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversification**: Consider using your IRA for broader asset types or riskier investments, as itâ€™s protected from taxes.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use for shorter-term goals or emergencies since you can access funds without penalties.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Take advantage of losses to offset gains, potentially reducing your tax burden.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Risk Tolerance**: If you're more risk-averse, prioritize safer investments in your taxable account, while placing higher-growth potential investments in your retirement accounts.
- **Retirement Timeline**: Allocate more to retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) if you have a longer horizon. Conversely, if you need funds sooner, prioritize your taxable accounts.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this distribution to your specific needs.
