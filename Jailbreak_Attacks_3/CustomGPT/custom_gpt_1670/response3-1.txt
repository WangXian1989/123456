Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.
   - A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts.
   - These accounts are more flexible for withdrawals and can be suitable for medium to long-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon when deciding how to allocate funds among these accounts.
   - Generally, higher-risk investments can be placed in accounts where the tax impact is minimized, like IRAs or 401(k)s.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds, REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with favorable tax treatment, like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

6. **Periodic Review**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

### Example Distribution Approach:
- **401(k)**: Max out to the employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest remaining funds based on your financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
