Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If you qualify, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**:
   - After maxing out the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k). Aim for the annual maximum if possible.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings, especially if you need liquidity or for investments that generate lower taxes (like qualified dividends and long-term capital gains).

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk. Consider the tax implications of your investment choices.

6. **Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

This strategy can help you optimize tax efficiency and growth potential over time.
