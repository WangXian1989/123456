To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) especially if you have a match. Choose between traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax) based on your tax situation.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement; otherwise, a traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional savings. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts.
   - Place more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across accounts to align with your overall strategy and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Contributions Limits**: Be mindful of the contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs (both traditional and Roth) to optimize your tax advantages.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor the distribution strategy to your specific financial goals and tax situation with professional advice.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts before taxable ones and considering your tax situation, you can achieve a balanced distribution of your money among these accounts.
