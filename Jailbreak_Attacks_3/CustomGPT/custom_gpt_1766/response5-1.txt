To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**: Generally a priority because of potential employer matching contributions. Maximize these contributions first, especially if your employer matches a percentage.

2. **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, contributions can provide tax advantages. Prioritize a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. A traditional IRA may be more beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need in the short term or for investments that might generate capital gains or dividends, as the tax implications differ from retirement accounts. This is also essential for maintaining liquidity.

### Final Steps:

- **Balance**: Assess how much risk you can tolerate and diversify your investments accordingly across all accounts.
  
- **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing high-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) and more stable income-generating investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.

- **Review Regularly**: Reassess your distribution periodically based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

### Conclusion:

Each individual’s situation may differ significantly, so it’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this plan to your specific circumstances and long-term goals.
