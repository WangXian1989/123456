Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maxing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax-advantaged growth.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)** and **traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. It's often beneficial to hold investments for over a year to minimize taxes.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Short-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts, while long-term goals can benefit from the tax advantages of retirement accounts.
   - Consider risk tolerance and diversification across these accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in a savings account separate from these investments for unforeseen expenses.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your overall financial strategy.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
