Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income, which can be advantageous if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions can benefit you if you're in a high tax bracket now.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Diversification**: Having both a Traditional and Roth IRA can provide flexibility in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts can be accessed without penalties, making them suitable for short-term savings or investments.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Max Out 401(k)**: Prioritize contributions up to the employer match, then consider maxing out your IRA.
- **Evaluate Time Horizon**: If you need funds sooner, prioritize taxable accounts. For long-term growth, maximize tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, maintain a diversified portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
- **Review Annually**: Regularly assess your strategy based on changes in income, life circumstances, and tax laws.
