Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits:** In 2024, the contribution limit for 401(k) plans is typically $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). Aim to contribute as much as you can, balanced with your immediate financial needs.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA:** Decide between a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions but taxed upon withdrawal). Your current tax rate and expected future tax rate should help inform this decision.
   - **Contribution Limits:** In 2024, the contribution limit for IRAs is generally $6,500 (or $7,500 if youâ€™re over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexible Access:** Money in taxable accounts is accessible without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Use tax-efficient investments, like index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize tax liability.

4. **Diversification Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. This means having a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments across all account types.

5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your investment allocations to maintain your desired risk profile.

6. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a 401(k) or IRA) while keeping income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

7. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Before heavily investing in retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.
