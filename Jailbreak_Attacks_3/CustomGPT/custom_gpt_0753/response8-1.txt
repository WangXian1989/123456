Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), you may get a tax deduction for contributions, but withdrawals are taxable.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, making it a great option for future tax diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts won’t provide tax benefits for contributions, but they may offer more flexibility for withdrawals. Consider holding investments with lower taxes (e.g., long-term gains) here.

3. **Prioritize Investments Based on Goals**:
   - If you’re saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) before taxable accounts.
   - If you have short-term goals (like buying a house), consider keeping more in taxable accounts for easier access.

4. **Diversify Your Investments**: Allocate your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts according to your risk tolerance.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changing goals or life circumstances.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique financial situation.
