When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (Roth or traditional) before taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance growth.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds) and hold high-growth or high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you'll withdraw money in retirement. Generally, assets in taxable accounts are tapped first for flexibility, while tax-advantaged accounts might be accessed later to allow for continued tax-deferred growth.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Always consider your current and expected future tax rates. Roth accounts grow tax-free, while traditional accounts will be taxed upon withdrawal.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of retirement accounts for unexpected expenses.
