Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Both accounts offer tax advantages. Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, with taxes owed upon withdrawal. Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings are taxed annually. Consider placing investments that generate capital gains (like stocks) here, especially if you plan to hold them long-term.

### 2. **Emergency Savings:**
   - Maintain a separate account for emergency savings outside of retirement accounts to ensure liquidity.

### 3. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if there's matching. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50). 
   - Contribute to an IRA; the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Base your asset allocation on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, prioritize aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks), while more conservative investments (like bonds) can be split between accounts.
   - Use higher turnover (e.g., actively managed funds) in tax-deferred accounts to avoid immediate tax implications.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out contributions to gain tax benefits and employer match.
- **IRA:** Contribute consistently, considering a Roth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Once maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use these for additional investments, focusing on long-term growth assets.

### Summary:
A generalized approach is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts while ensuring liquidity through taxable accounts. Tailor the specifics to your financial situation and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
