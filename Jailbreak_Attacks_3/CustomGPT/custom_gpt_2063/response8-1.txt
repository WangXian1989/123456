Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Short-term needs**: Money needed within 1-5 years may be better placed in taxable accounts for easy access.
   - **Long-term goals**: Funds intended for retirement can be prioritized in tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, which is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if funds allow, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions. If eligible, contribute to max limits.

### 3. **Balance Contributions**
   - Allocate funds based on tax treatment:
     - **Tax-deferred accounts** (401(k) and Traditional IRA): Best for higher-income years.
     - **Tax-free growth accounts** (Roth IRA): Consider funding if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Taxable accounts**: Use for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on risk tolerance and market conditions across all account types.
   - Avoid over-concentration in one account type to mitigate risk.

### 5. **Evaluate and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically review your allocations and performance. Adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal circumstances.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider professional advice tailored to your specific situation for optimal tax efficiency and investment strategy.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to maximize growth and minimize tax liabilities.
