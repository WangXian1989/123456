When allocating funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA (Tax-Deferred)**: Prioritize these accounts for higher-growth investments, as taxes on gains are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that yield capital gains or qualified dividends which are taxed at a lower rate. Consider holding lower-risk or income-generating assets here.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you're aware of contribution limits for each account type. Optimize contributions to meet these limits where possible.

4. **Investment Goals**: Align your investments with your goals:
   - **Retirement**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for more liquid and lower-risk investments (bonds, cash equivalents).

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement:
   - Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.
   - Consider your tax bracket to minimize taxes owed on withdrawals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
