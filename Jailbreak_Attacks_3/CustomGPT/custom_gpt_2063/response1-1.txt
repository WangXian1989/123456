Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax efficiency, investment goals, and liquidity. Here’s a structured approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match—this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions here first. Choose a mix of stocks and bonds that matches your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: After the 401(k), consider a Roth or Traditional IRA to further take advantage of tax benefits. A Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA may give you a tax deduction upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged options, invest in taxable accounts. These provide liquidity and flexibility for short-term needs or goals.

4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**:
   - **Growth Investments**: Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free compounding.
   - **Income Investments**: Consider holding income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where they might be taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically assess your allocations to align with changing financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Professional**: For personalized strategies, consider working with a financial advisor to navigate tax implications and optimize your portfolio.

This strategic distribution can help enhance growth potential while managing risks and tax liabilities effectively.
