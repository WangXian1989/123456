Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible, especially if in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA:** Consider funding a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax status.

### 2. **Assess Your Needs**
   - **Short-Term Needs:** If you need access to funds before retirement, prioritize taxable accounts. Keep an emergency fund and savings in high-yield savings or liquid investments.
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on your 401(k) and IRA for their long-term growth potential. These accounts benefit from compounding interest over time.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts. This can include stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Ensure that you have a balanced approach aligned with your risk tolerance.

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations in each account to maintain your target asset allocation as markets fluctuate.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Understand the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type. Taxable accounts may incur capital gains tax, while withdrawals from traditional accounts are typically taxable as income.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

By maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, and using taxable accounts as needed for short-term goals, you can effectively grow your wealth while managing your tax liability.
