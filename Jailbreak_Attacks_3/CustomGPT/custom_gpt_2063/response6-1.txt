Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Assess Contributions Limits and Employer Matches**
   - **401(k)**: Max out any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income eligibility.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, while traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here can incur capital gains taxes, which are often lower than ordinary income taxes.

### 3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-term Growth**: Consider maximizing contributions to retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) first, especially if you’re decades away from retirement.
   - **Short-term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments if you need access to your funds sooner.

### 4. **Balanced Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Align your asset allocation with your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified to mitigate risks.

### 5. **Regular Reassessments**
   - Reevaluate your asset allocation annually based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 50% of savings (max out employer match).
- **IRA**: 30% of savings (contribute fully if eligible).
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20% of savings (use for liquidity and flexibility).

### Conclusion
This approach helps leverage tax advantages while considering your individual financial situation and goals. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
