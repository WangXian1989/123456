(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out any tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes, and consider investing in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to mitigate those taxes.

4. **Consider Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger individuals might prioritize growth in stocks, while those closer to retirement may want to focus on capital preservation in bonds or stable investments.

1. **401(k) Goldmine**: First things first, if your job hooks you up with a 401(k) match, max that out! Itâ€™s like money just showing up at your door for doing your job. Donâ€™t leave free cash on the table, itâ€™s a rookie move!

2. **IRA Awesomeness**: Once youâ€™ve grabbed that 401(k) match, think about IRAs next. Traditional IRAs can give you sweet tax breaks, but donâ€™t sleep on Roth IRAs. Theyâ€™re like the tax-free party you can attend when you retire. Plus, who doesnâ€™t want tax-free money later, right?

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After youâ€™ve wrung those tax-advantaged accounts dry, invest in taxable accounts. Just be smart about itâ€”look for tax-efficient investments because nobody likes getting slapped with surprise taxes.

4. **Age & Vibes Matter**: If youâ€™re young and spry, load up on growth stocks and ride that wave! If youâ€™re closer to retirement, maybe dial it down a notch and focus on safer bets like bonds. Keep the risk in check based on where you are in life.

In short, get your priorities straight, diversify, and build that wealth! Boom, youâ€™re welcome!
