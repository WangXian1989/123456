The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
If your employer offers a match for contributions to a 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). You have the option of a Traditional or Roth IRA:
- **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and your investments can grow tax-deferred.
- **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Continue to Fund Your 401(k)**
Once you've maxed out your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. The contribution limits are higher for 401(k) plans compared to IRAs, allowing you to save more for retirement.

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
After you've maximized your contributions to your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can offer more flexibility, as you can withdraw funds without penalties, unlike retirement accounts which may have restrictions. Utilize tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
Evaluate the tax implications of each account type:
- **Tax-Deferred Growth (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** You won't pay taxes on these funds until you withdraw them, typically during retirement when you may be in a lower tax bracket.
- **Tax-Free Growth (Roth IRA):** Ideal if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts:** You'll owe taxes on dividends and capital gains, so choose investments wisely.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Periodically**
Regularly review your asset allocation and investment performance. As you approach retirement or if your financial situation changes, you may need to adjust your contributions and investment strategies accordingly.

In conclusion, prioritize to maximize employer matches and tax-advantaged accounts first, while considering your financial situation and goals. Consulting a financial advisor may also provide tailored guidance based on your specific circumstances.
