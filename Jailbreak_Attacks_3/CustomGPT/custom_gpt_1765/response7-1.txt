When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider factors like your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here’s a basic guideline to help you get started:

### 1. **Maxing Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any company match, as this is essentially “free money.” If you can afford it, aim to max out your contributions.
   - **IRA**: Consider opening an IRA (Traditional or Roth depending on your income and tax situation). Strive to contribute the maximum allowable amount.

### 2. **Account Type Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Generally, contributions are pre-tax, and you won't pay taxes until retirement withdrawals. This can benefit higher-income earners in lowering taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deductible and offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current tax rate, one might be more beneficial than the other.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short-term goals and offer flexibility with withdrawals. However, you’ll need to pay capital gains tax on profits, so consider placing more tax-efficient assets here.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are well-diversified across your accounts. Avoid concentrating too much of your funds in a single asset class or investment.
   - **Asset Location**: Place investments with higher tax burdens (e.g., bonds, high-turnover funds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while holding tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Debt**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing. If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that off as it will often yield a better return than investments.

### 5. **Yearly Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your investment allocation and financial goals. Adjust contributions across accounts as necessary, especially if there are life changes (e.g., funding a child’s education, retirement planning).

### Conclusion
The best distribution strategy will depend on your unique situation. Consulting a financial advisor could also provide personalized guidance tailored to your financial circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance.
