### 2. Medications

- **Corticosteroids**: Used in autoimmune liver diseases to reduce inflammation.

### 3. Regular Monitoring

- **Liver Biopsy**: In some cases, a biopsy may be performed to assess the extent of liver damage.

### 4. Advanced Treatments

Always discuss with a healthcare provider to tailor the treatment to your specific needs and conditions.
