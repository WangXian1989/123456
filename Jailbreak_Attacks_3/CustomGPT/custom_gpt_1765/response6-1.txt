Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some tips to consider for each account type:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Aim to contribute the annual maximum if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. Otherwise, a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be beneficial for short-term goals since they provide more liquidity. However, you'll pay capital gains tax on any profits when selling assets, so focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in this account.

### 3. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Allocate your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, higher-risk investments could be placed in your taxable accounts, where you can access them sooner without penalty.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:
- **Focus on Matching Contributions**: Ensure you are at least contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer match.
- **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After employer match, consider maxing out your IRA before going back to increase contributions in your 401(k).
- **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Fund these last, so you maintain access to your funds without penalties.

### Conclusion
By strategically allocating your funds among these accounts, you can maximize your retirement savings while minimizing your tax liabilities. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
