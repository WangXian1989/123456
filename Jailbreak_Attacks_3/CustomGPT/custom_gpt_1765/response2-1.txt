Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Contribute to Your 401(k) First**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income, which can be beneficial in the current tax year.

### 2. **Consider an IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Types of IRAs**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer tax-deferred growth, a Traditional IRA might be the better option.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the contribution limits for IRAs ($6,500 for those under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and over in 2023).
   - **Late Contributing**: If you're already maxing out your 401(k) and want to further your retirement savings, consider contributing to an IRA next.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Investments Outside Retirement Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This can provide you liquidity for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Strategies**: Utilize strategies like tax-loss harvesting or investing in tax-efficient funds to minimize tax liabilities on gains.

### 4. **Adjust for Your Goals**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts. This provides a safety net for unexpected expenses.
   - **Future Needs**: Consider your timeline for using these funds. If you’re saving for retirement, prioritize long-term growth through tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, favor taxable accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and market conditions. Rebalance if necessary.

### Summary:
- Prioritize your 401(k) for employer matching and tax benefits.
- Max out an IRA once your 401(k) contributions are comfortable.
- Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and shorter-term needs.
- Monitor and adjust as necessary based on your financial goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique situation.
