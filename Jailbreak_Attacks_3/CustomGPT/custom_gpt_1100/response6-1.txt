To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as tax-free withdrawals can be beneficial in retirement.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place higher growth assets (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Income Generating Assets in Taxable Accounts:** Bonds or dividend-paying stocks can help manage tax liabilities, as qualified dividends and capital gains may be taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Take into account your current and expected future tax brackets to determine where to place your investments for optimal tax efficiency.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals from these accounts strategically during retirement to minimize your overall tax liability.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk and enhance returns.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k):** 50% of total contributions
- **IRA:** 20% of total contributions
- **Taxable Accounts:** 30% of total contributions

This approach will help balance growth potential with tax efficiency while considering your financial goals and retirement timeline.
