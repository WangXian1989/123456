When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then max out your IRA if possible. This helps reduce your taxable income.

2. **Investment Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your goals. Use 401(k)s and IRAs for long-term growth investments. If you have short-term goals, consider keeping funds in taxable accounts for easier access.

3. **Fees and Investment Options**: Evaluate the fees and investment choices in your 401(k). If the investment options are limited or costly, consider investing more in your IRA or taxable accounts, where you have greater flexibility.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your future withdrawal needs. Withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) are taxable, while qualified withdrawals from taxable accounts may be more favorable, especially if held long-term.

A mix of contributions to each account type, reflecting your specific financial situation and retirement goals, is key for effective distribution. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
