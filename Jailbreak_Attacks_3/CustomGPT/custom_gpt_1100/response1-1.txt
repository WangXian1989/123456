Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: If you can, max out contributions to your IRA (traditional or Roth) next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

3. **Utilize a 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Focus on low-fee investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement age. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Diversification Strategy**: Make sure to have a balanced portfolio among all accounts, adjusting for risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and any changes in your financial situation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
