To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Max out any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - Contribute the maximum allowed if you can. This reduces your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. 
   - If you need tax deductions, prioritize a Traditional IRA. Ensure you know the income limits and Roth conversion options.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), contribute to taxable accounts.
   - Invest in lower-turnover funds to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider tax-efficient strategies, such as tax-loss harvesting.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund for liquidity, typically in high-yield savings accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced investment strategy based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and life events.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
