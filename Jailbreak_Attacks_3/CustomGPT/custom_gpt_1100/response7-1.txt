Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA for the tax benefits. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and for an IRA, it's $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, with tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short-term goals since they offer more flexibility. However, investments are subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a separate emergency savings account, ideally covering 3-6 months of expenses, before heavily investing.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account type, ensure you're diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Consider dollar-cost averaging by contributing regularly to smooth out market volatility.

7. **Reassess Periodically**: Review your allocations annually or after major life changes to ensure they align with your goals.
