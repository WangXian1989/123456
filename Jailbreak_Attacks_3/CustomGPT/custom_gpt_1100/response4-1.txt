To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Max out any employer match first; it's essentially free money.
   - Choose investments that align with your long-term goals, typically higher growth options for younger investors.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA if eligible, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - For Traditional IRAs, consider your current tax bracket and potential future tax implications.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that produce lower tax liabilities, such as index funds or ETFs.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

**General Strategy**:
- Aim for a balanced asset allocation tailored to your risk tolerance.
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio as needed.
