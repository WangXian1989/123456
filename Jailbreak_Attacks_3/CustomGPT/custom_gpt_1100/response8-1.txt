Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match: Contribute enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth: Contributions reduce taxable income, boosting retirement savings.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Traditional IRA: Good for tax-deductible contributions if you're eligible; withdrawals during retirement are taxed.
   - Roth IRA: Contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for shorter-term goals: Ideal for money needed within a few years.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments: Consider using index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Approach:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a comfortable emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Prioritize Accounts**: Start with maximizing your 401(k) match, then contribute to your IRA, and finally allocate funds to taxable accounts as needed.
- **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
