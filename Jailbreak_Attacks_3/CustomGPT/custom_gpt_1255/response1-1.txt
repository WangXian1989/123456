Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing any employer match in your 401(k). This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum allowed, focusing on pre-tax contributions if your goal is to reduce taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA (for tax-deferred growth) or a Roth IRA (for tax-free growth in retirement). Roth IRAs are great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After contributing to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This allows for more liquidity and flexibility if you need funds before retirement. Here, consider investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for favorable tax treatment.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Review Regularly**: Assess your asset allocation periodically to make adjustments as your goals and market conditions change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, especially regarding tax implications based on your situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

This approach balances tax benefits while maintaining liquidity for future needs.
