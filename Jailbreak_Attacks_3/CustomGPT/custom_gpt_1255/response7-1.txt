To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - Prioritize maxing out any employer-matched contributions in your 401(k), as this is essentially free money.
   - Contribute to your IRA (Roth or Traditional) next, especially if you're eligible for tax advantages. 

2. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have a solid emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a savings account before heavily investing.

3. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - 401(k) and IRA accounts provide tax-deferred growth, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes until you withdraw funds.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains and qualified dividends, which are usually taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Look into tax-efficient investments for your taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax burdens.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically during retirement to minimize tax impacts; you may want to delay withdrawals from retirement accounts for as long as possible to maximize tax benefits.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Review and rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Personalized advice can be invaluable, especially regarding tax implications and retirement planning.

This balanced approach aims to maximize growth while minimizing tax liabilities over time.
