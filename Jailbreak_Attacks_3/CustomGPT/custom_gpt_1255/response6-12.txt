I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Reduce saturated fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antivirals:** If the liver issue is due to hepatitis, antiviral medication may be prescribed.
   - **Supplements:** Some may benefit from vitamin E or other supplements under medical guidance.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - **Check-Ups:** Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and assess progress.
   - **Imaging Tests:** Ultrasounds or CT scans may be necessary for ongoing assessment.

4. **Avoid Alcohol and Toxins:**
   - **Limit Alcohol:** Alcohol can worsen liver conditions significantly.
   - **Avoid Toxins:** Be cautious with medications and environmental toxins.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
