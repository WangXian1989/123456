Distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering a few key factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income. Consider maximizing employer match contributions first.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth. Allocate funds based on your future tax expectations.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your short-term and long-term financial goals. For retirement, focus on tax-advantaged accounts; for shorter time horizons, use taxable accounts for flexibility.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to mitigate risk. Use accounts for different investment strategiesâ€”riskier assets in tax-advantaged accounts (to avoid taxes) and more stable investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you'll withdraw funds. Taxable accounts can offer more flexibility, while withdrawals from retirement accounts could incur penalties if done early.

5. **Fees and Expenses**:
   - Compare fees associated with your accounts. Minimize expenses to maximize returns.

A balanced approach often involves funding your 401(k) up to any employer match, contributing to an IRA for additional tax benefits, and using taxable accounts for liquidity and short-term needs. Consulting a financial advisor can tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
