Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors. Hereâ€™s a strategy to optimize your investments:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred account, often with employer match; can involve higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA**: Also tax-deferred (Traditional) or post-tax (Roth); lower contribution limits than 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes; provides flexibility in withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (whether Traditional or Roth) next.
   - **Contribute Beyond the Match**: After maxing the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance & Time Horizon**: Your age, risk tolerance, and investment goals should guide how you allocate assets among these accounts.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on gains.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for more conservative investments (bonds, dividend stocks) which might generate regular income.

### 4. **Withdrawals Strategy**
   - **Consider Future Taxes**: Plan which accounts to withdraw from in retirement to minimize tax burdens (e.g., withdrawing from taxable first could be advantageous).
   - **RMDs**: Be aware of Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) for 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs starting at age 73.

### 5. **Review & Adjust**
   - Regularly reassess your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on performance and life changes.

### Summary
1. Max out employer match in 401(k).
2. Contribute to an IRA.
3. Continue maximizing 401(k).
4. Optimize asset allocation based on growth potential and tax implications.
