Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some steps to consider for optimal distribution:

1. **Contribute to Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is effectively free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Check the contribution limit and your taxation bracket. Itâ€™s typically beneficial to maximize contributions especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, also consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth), depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, whereas Traditional IRAs provide tax advantages now.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can use taxable accounts for additional investments. They offer more flexibility in terms of accessing funds but come with different tax implications.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments within each account are diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline. This means investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in market conditions, your personal financial situation, and approaching retirement age.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain, it may be beneficial to work with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that fits your unique situation.

Remember, while these guidelines can help, individual circumstances greatly influence the best approach to your investments.
