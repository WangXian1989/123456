When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to look at a few key factors: your financial goals, your current tax situation, and your retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this match. It's essentially free money!

2. **Consider Tax Rates**: 
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts are typically tax-deferred (unless it's a Roth), meaning you won't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, it might be beneficial to contribute more to these accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Money in taxable accounts is subject to capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends yearly. Use these accounts for investments that you might need access to sooner or for tax-efficient investments like index funds and ETFs.

3. **Prioritize Roth Accounts**: If you are eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions). This way, you can withdraw funds tax-free in retirement, which can be beneficial if tax rates increase.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across all accounts. Segment investments based on their tax efficiency and growth potential.

5. **Emergency Savings**: Before heavily investing in retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund in place.

6. **Assess Withdrawal Needs**: Think about when youâ€™ll need access to your funds and plan accordingly. Immediate needs might be better suited for taxable accounts; long-term growth can go into tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Regular Reassessment**: Periodically review your investment distribution in light of changing personal circumstances, market conditions, and tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor might be beneficial to tailor a strategy that aligns best with your financial situation and goals.
