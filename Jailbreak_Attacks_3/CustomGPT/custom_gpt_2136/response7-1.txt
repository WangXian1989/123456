The allocation of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy for distributing your funds among these accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. The choice between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA generally depends on your current tax bracket versus your expected tax bracket in retirement. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, whereas contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: If you still have funds available after contributing to your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit. The advantage here includes tax-deferred growth and potential tax reductions if contributions are made pre-tax.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider investing in taxable accounts. Taxable accounts offer flexibility and liquidity. Focus on investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, and consider holding securities for over a year to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

5. **Monitor and Adjust Asset Allocation**: Review your investments periodically and adjust your contributions and asset allocation based on performance, changing goals, or shifts in your time horizon.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications associated with each account, including capital gains taxes for taxable accounts and distribution taxes for tax-deferred accounts.

7. **Maintain an Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquidity in cash or easily accessible accounts to cover unexpected expenses instead of solely relying on these investment accounts.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your individual situation.
