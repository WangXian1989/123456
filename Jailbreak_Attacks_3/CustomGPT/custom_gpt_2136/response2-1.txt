The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, make sure you contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions:**
   After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. IRAs can provide tax advantagesâ€”traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed. This may be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free. This might be advantageous if you expect to be in the same or a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   If you have additional funds to invest after maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider taxable investment accounts. These offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes on earnings.

5. **Diversification Across Accounts:**
   Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. This helps manage risk and take advantage of different tax treatments. For instance, consider keeping more aggressive investments in Roth accounts (to benefit from tax-free growth) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Review Regularly:**
   Regularly assess your contributions and investment performance to make sure your allocation aligns with your goals and risk tolerance. Adjust as needed based on changes in your income, expenses, and life events.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide tailored strategies based on your unique financial situation.

By balancing contributions among these accounts according to your financial circumstances and future plans, you can effectively manage your retirement savings and maximize growth while attending to tax efficiency.
