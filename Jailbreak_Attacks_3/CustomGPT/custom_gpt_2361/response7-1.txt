Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions. Depending on your income, you might prioritize one over the other.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds that you might need before retirement or for investments that generate qualified dividends (which are taxed at a lower rate).

### 3. **Investment Goals**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Funds needed in the next 1-5 years should be in a safer investment (like cash or conservative funds) within taxable accounts.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Allocate more to growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA since they can benefit from compounding and tax-deferred or tax-free growth.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Choose a mix based on risk tolerance. Look for low-cost index funds.
   - **IRA**: Similar to your 401(k), but you can diversify further by selecting different asset classes.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in a mix of stocks and bonds, considering tax implications of capital gains.

### 5. **Regular Review & Rebalance**
   - Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- Max out employer match in 401(k)
- Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible
- Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments

### Conclusion
Tailor the distribution to your risk tolerance, retirement timeline, and immediate cash needs. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your financial situation.
