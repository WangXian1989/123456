Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you qualify, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA for tax benefits, depending on whether you prefer tax-free growth or tax-deferred contributions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Utilize these for investments that generate low distributions (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Hold tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., municipal bonds or stocks) to keep tax burdens lower.

### 3. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds) according to your risk tolerance.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired allocation.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**
   - Keep enough liquidity in a savings account for emergencies before investing heavily outside tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Long-Term Focus**
   - Prioritize growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts where they can compound without immediate tax implications.

### Conclusion
- Tailor your contributions based on retirement goals, ensuring that you cover immediate needs while taking advantage of all tax benefits.
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations as circumstances change.
