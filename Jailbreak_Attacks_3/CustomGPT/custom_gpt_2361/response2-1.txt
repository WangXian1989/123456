Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution Level**: Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) based on your current and expected future tax brackets.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergencies, as they allow easier access to funds.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in these accounts to minimize tax implications.

### 4. **Overall Allocation Strategy**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment mix across all accounts.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Maintain your target asset allocation by periodically rebalancing your portfolio.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Income**: Higher-income years might suggest prioritizing tax-deferred accounts to lower taxable income.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals in retirement to minimize tax impact.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - **Before Investing**: Make sure you have a sufficient emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a readily accessible account.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **40% in 401(k)**
- **30% in Traditional/Roth IRA**
- **30% in Taxable Accounts**

### Conclusion
Tailor the percentages based on your age, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice suited to your specific needs and goals.
