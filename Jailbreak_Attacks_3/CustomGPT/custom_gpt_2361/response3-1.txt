Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types and Benefits**
   - **401(k):**
     - Employer-sponsored.
     - Offers tax deferral and potential employer matching.
     - Contribution limits are higher compared to IRAs.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
     - Traditional IRA offers tax deferral, while Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
     - Lower contribution limits compared to a 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - No contribution limits.
     - Earnings are subject to capital gains taxes.
     - More flexibility, but potentially higher tax liability.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to take full advantage of employer matches (if available).
   - Contribute to your IRA, especially if you can benefit from tax advantages.
   - Allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** 
     - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, focus on traditional accounts (401(k) or IRA).
     - If you expect to be in a higher bracket, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
   - Utilize long-term capital gains tax rates in your taxable account by holding investments longer.

### 4. **Determine Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - If you’re investing for retirement, tilt more towards tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Short-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts for liquidity reasons.

### 5. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts; avoid concentration in one account type.
   - Rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Periodically review your contributions and investment performance.
   - Make adjustments based on changes in income, expenses, or life events.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **Age 30:** Maximize 401(k) (e.g., 15% of salary) + contribute to IRA ($6,500).
- **Age 40:** Ensure 401(k) contributions continue, contribute to Roth IRA if eligible, invest excess in taxable.
- **Age 50+:** Consider a mix of all accounts, focusing on tax strategies for withdrawing funds.

### Conclusion
Start by maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, adjust based on your income and investment goals, and maintain a diversified portfolio. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique circumstances.
