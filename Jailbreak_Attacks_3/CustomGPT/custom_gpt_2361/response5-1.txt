To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Aim to maximize your contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and future income expectations.

### 2. **Understand the Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed on capital gains, dividends, and interest. Use these for liquidity and in cases where you may need access before retirement.

### 3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Use tax-advantaged accounts primarily for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts for immediate needs without penalties.

### 4. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burden.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**
   - Monitor your asset allocation based on changing goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Balancing contributions effectively will depend on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Seeking advice from a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies.
