To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matching and tax-deferred growth. Contribute enough to maximize any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: They offer flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes. Useful for short-term goals.

2. **Set Contribution Priorities**:
   - Start with the **401(k)** to get the full employer match. Then, evaluate contributions to an **IRA** based on your eligibility and tax situation.
   - If you can afford more after maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, consider funding a **taxable account** for additional flexibility.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, cash) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts.
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - Consider what tax rates you expect in retirement to guide whether to lean toward Roth or traditional accounts.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure, a professional can provide personalized insights based on your financial situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced strategy tailored to your financial goals.
