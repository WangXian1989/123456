When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

### 1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Ideal for long-term growth.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment income will be subject to capital gains taxes. Use these for short-term goals or investments that generate qualified dividends.

### 2. **Contribution Limits:**
   - 401(k): Check the current annual contribution limit.
   - IRA: Be aware of the limits for traditional and Roth IRAs.
   - Taxable Accounts: No limits, but focus on asset allocation.

### 3. **Investment Goals:**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, ETFs) across all accounts to optimize growth and reduce risk.

### 5. **Matching Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers a match on the 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first—it’s essentially free money.

### Example Strategy: 
1. Max out employer match in the 401(k).
2. Contribute to either a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.
3. Use taxable accounts for any additional investments, focusing on tax-efficient funds.

### Regular Review:
- Periodically review and adjust your strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a tailored approach specific to your situation.
