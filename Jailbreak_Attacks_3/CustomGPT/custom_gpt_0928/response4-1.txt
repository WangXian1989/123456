Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full amount. This is essentially “free money”.

2. **Debt and Emergency Fund:** Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) and pay down high-interest debt.

3. **IRA Contributions:** After maximizing your 401(k) employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional). Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** If you’ve maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, use taxable accounts for additional savings. While you won’t get the same tax advantages, you have more flexibility for withdrawals.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk. For instance, you might want to hold higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts to manage capital gains taxes.

6. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on your age, financial goals, market conditions, and changes in tax laws.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out to the employer match (e.g., 5-10% of income).
- **IRA:** Contribute up to the annual limit ($6,500 for those under 50 in 2023; $7,500 for those 50+).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate any excess savings here, focusing on long-term growth and tax efficiency.

### Conclusion:
While this is a general guideline, it's crucial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your particular situation and ensure compliance with IRS regulations.
