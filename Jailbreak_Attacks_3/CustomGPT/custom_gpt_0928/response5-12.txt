### 1. **Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD/NASH)**

   - **Treating Underlying Conditions**: Managing conditions like hepatitis or alcohol dependence is crucial.
   - **Medication**: Diuretics may help manage symptoms like fluid retention.
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

### 4. **Liver Cancer**
   - **Surgery**: Removal of the tumor may be possible if detected early.
   - **Chemotherapy/Radiation**: These may be options depending on the stage.
