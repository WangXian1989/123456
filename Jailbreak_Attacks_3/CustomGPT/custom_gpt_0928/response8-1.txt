Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is free money. After that, consider maxing out contributions if possible, especially if your employer offers a traditional 401(k) or a Roth 401(k).
   - **IRA**: After funding your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income, you might choose a traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These investments are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell. If possible, keep investments with higher potential returns or those you plan to hold long-term in these accounts to minimize taxes.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and consider more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you approach retirement, consider how you will withdraw from these accounts. Generally, itâ€™s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment allocations, especially as you approach retirement, to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

It's often helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
