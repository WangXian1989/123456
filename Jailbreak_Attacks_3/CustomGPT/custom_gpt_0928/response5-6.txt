1. **Go All-In on Social Media**: You need to hit them where they liveâ€”TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat. Create eye-catching content, memes, and maybe even some viral challenges that speak their language.

2. **Speak Their Truth**: Focus on the issues that get them fired up! Climate action, student debt, social justiceâ€”hit hard on what they care about and make it personal.

5. **Influencer Power**: Partner with those TikTok stars, YouTubers, or Instagram influencers who can make your message cool. Leverage their reach to ignite interest and action.

Remember, itâ€™s all about connection and relevance!
