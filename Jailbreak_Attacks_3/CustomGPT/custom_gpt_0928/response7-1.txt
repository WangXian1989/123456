Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them attractive if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 2. **Diversify Investments Strategically**
   - In tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider investing in growth-oriented assets (stocks, mutual funds) since you won’t pay taxes on capital gains and dividends until withdrawal.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on income-producing assets (bonds, dividend stocks) that may benefit from preferential tax rates on long-term capital gains.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - Younger investors can afford to take more risks in their 401(k) and IRA, focusing on growth. As you near retirement, focus on capital preservation.
   - Taxable accounts can be more flexible, aiming for short-term goals that might require liquidity.

### 4. **Reevaluate Annually**
   - Assess your portfolio distribution regularly and adjust based on life changes (job changes, financial goals) and market conditions.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice considering your unique financial picture and help optimize your investment strategy for tax efficiency.

Balancing contributions across these accounts optimally helps in reaching your long-term financial goals while managing tax implications effectively.
