To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) as they provide tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement without penalties.

3. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and how long until you need the money.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.)

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan for withdrawals in retirement, considering which accounts to draw from first to minimize taxes.
