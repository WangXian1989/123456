Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After taking advantage of the employer match, prioritize funding your IRA (either traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages. Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Funds in taxable accounts don't benefit from tax-deferred growth like 401(k)s and IRAs. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, consider putting more into tax-deferred accounts now to minimize taxes later.

4. **Invest for Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Use your 401(k) and IRA for investments with high growth potential, as these accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Flexibility and Emergency Funds**: Keep a reserve in your taxable account for emergencies or opportunities, since withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts may incur penalties or taxes.

7. **Revisit and Adjust**: Regularly review your account distribution and make adjustments as needed based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and the market.

Before making decisions, it might also be wise to consult a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
