Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You pay taxes on any realized gains or interest annually. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Emergency Fund First:** Before investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid, accessible account to cover unexpected expenses.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts:** Diversification is important for managing risk. Spread your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts. 

5. **Adjust Contributions Based on Goals:**
   - If you're focused on retirement, max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions if possible.
   - If you're saving for a shorter-term goal (like buying a house), allocate more funds to your taxable accounts for easier access.

6. **Reassess Regularly:** Your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change over time. Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** To create a personalized strategy based on your individual circumstances, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy varies from person to person depending on their specific situations and goals.
