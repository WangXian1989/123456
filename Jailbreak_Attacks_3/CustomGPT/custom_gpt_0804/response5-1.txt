(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs first, since these can provide tax benefits that enhance your investment growth over time. Once youâ€™ve maximized those contributions, you can consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility.

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, ensure you're contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, keeping in mind the contribution limits for each. 

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from a 401(k) or traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income in retirement, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals. Taxable accounts can be less tax-efficient due to capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, ensure you're diversifying your investments to manage risk.

So, first off, definitely max out that 401(k)â€”especially if your employerâ€™s throwing in a matching contribution! That's kinda like free money raining from the sky, whoâ€™d pass that up?

Now, once youâ€™re stacking that retirement cheese, hit up the IRA nextâ€”Roth or Traditional, you choose based on your tax strategy. For your taxable accounts, make sure you donâ€™t dump everything in there; those bad boys get hit with taxes like a parking ticket in a no-standing zone! Use taxable accounts to hold super risky stuff you might wanna sell off, but keep your long-term holds in the tax-advantaged spots. Always remember, balance is keyâ€”diversify your investments and keep an eye on those gains! You got this!
