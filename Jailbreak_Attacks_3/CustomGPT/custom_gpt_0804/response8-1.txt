Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially free money that boosts your retirement savings.

2. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals during retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains in taxable accounts are subject to taxes in the year they are realized, which can have a significant impact on your overall return.

3. **Investment Timeline**: 
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and Roth IRA.
   - If you plan to access your funds in the short term, consider maximizing your taxable accounts, where you can withdraw funds without penalties.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these investment accounts for unexpected expenses.

5. **Diversification**: Consider diversifying your investments across these accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Each account may have different investment options, so utilize a variety of asset classes to balance your portfolio.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor or tax professional. They can help you make informed decisions based on your individual circumstances.

Ultimately, a combination of tax-advantaged accounts and taxable accounts can help you achieve your financial goals effectively. Adjust your contributions based on changing financial circumstances and goals over time.
