When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best approach generally involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match for your contributions to a 401(k), it's generally wise to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially "free money" and offers high returns.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions to these accounts may lower your taxable income, and investments grow tax-deferred until you withdraw them in retirement. It’s essential to understand your expected tax bracket at retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If you’re considering a Roth IRA, remember that contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing in retirement accounts, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months' worth of expenses). This should be kept in a liquid, easily accessible account.

4. **Investment Options and Fees**: Review the investment options in your 401(k) as some have limited choices and high fees. In contrast, IRAs typically offer a wider range of investment options, which may lead to better long-term growth.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Taxable investing accounts can provide flexibility when you need to access funds before retirement age without incurring penalties, though you'll owe capital gains taxes on your earnings.

6. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, aim for a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This helps mitigate risk over time.

7. **Regular Contributions and Rebalancing**: Continuously contribute to your investment accounts and periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure alignment with your financial goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific circumstances.
