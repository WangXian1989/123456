To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute the maximum allowed. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Prioritize these accounts for investments expected to grow significantly, as gains are tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of Roth IRAs).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains, such as tax-efficient index funds or bonds.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Consider a diversified mix of stocks and bonds. Higher risk tolerance can lead to a more equity-heavy allocation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments and consider strategies to minimize taxes, like tax-loss harvesting.

4. **Accessibility and Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Keep in mind when you'll need access to funds. Taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, making them more liquid compared to retirement accounts.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

By balancing contributions based on tax implications and liquidity needs, you can create a strategy that supports your long-term financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice may also be beneficial.
