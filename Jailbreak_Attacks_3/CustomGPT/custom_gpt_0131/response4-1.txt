To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the maximum allowed, especially if your employer matches contributions.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free growth. If you prefer a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible.
  
3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds in a taxable account for flexibility and liquidity.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Place income-generating investments (like dividends or interest) in taxable accounts since they’re taxed at advantageous rates.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your asset allocation across accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your financial situation, tax bracket, and long-term goals by consulting a professional.

Each person’s situation is unique, so it's crucial to consider your specific circumstances and consult with a financial advisor if needed.
