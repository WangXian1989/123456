The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - Maximize contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; contributions grow tax-free.
   - Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, beneficial if you're currently in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for funds you'll need before retirement age, as they provide more flexibility.
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved outside of these accounts for emergencies.

5. **Diversify**: 
   - Regardless of account type, maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
