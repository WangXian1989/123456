Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider the investment options available and fees associated with your plan.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider it for tax-free growth and withdrawals. Traditional IRAs can provide short-term tax benefits.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Taxable accounts may be more suitable for short-term goals or investments you plan to access before retirement. They also offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts. This might involve having a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions and investments based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

This balanced approach helps optimize tax efficiency and savings potential for both retirement and other financial goals.
