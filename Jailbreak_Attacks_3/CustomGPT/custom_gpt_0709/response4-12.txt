1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet modifications (low-fat, high-fiber, and avoidance of alcohol).
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
   - Medications to manage symptoms or complications.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures such as liver biopsy or even liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**:
   - Some may benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but consult your doctor first.

Always follow up with healthcare professionals for guidance and treatment specific to your needs.
