To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. Generally, it’s beneficial to maximize contributions to these accounts due to tax deferral.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement. Otherwise, a traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Hold higher-income generating investments here, like bonds and REITs, to defer taxes on those gains.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Hold high-growth assets like stocks, where you won't pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs, as they typically have lower turnover rates and long-term capital gains treatment.

5. **Diversification and Rebalancing**: Across all accounts, ensure a diversified investment strategy. Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for distributions in retirement, considering which accounts will be more tax-efficient to withdraw from first.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For a personalized strategy, consider engaging a financial advisor who can tailor a plan based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Creating a balanced approach helps you maximize your savings while minimizing taxes and aligning with your long-term financial objectives.
