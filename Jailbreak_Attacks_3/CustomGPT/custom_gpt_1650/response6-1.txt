The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider contributing the maximum limit if you can afford it.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Roth or traditional) after your 401(k) match.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Gains are taxed as capital gains; long-term gains typically have a lower tax rate than ordinary income.

### 3. **Diversify Investment Types Across Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Focus on growth-oriented investments, as you won't pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **IRA:** Use a mix of growth and conservative investments, depending on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Favor investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax burdens.

### 4. **Planning for Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Withdraw tax-efficiently:** Plan to withdraw from your taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue to grow.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy to your unique circumstances, adjusting contributions and allocations as your financial situation evolves. It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to personalize your approach further.
