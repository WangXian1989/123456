(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA before investing heavily in taxable accounts. This helps defer taxes and grow your investments more efficiently.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before investing.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized your contributions to retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account, diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

1. **Get That Free Money**: If your 401(k) has a matching contribution, shove as much cash in as you can to grab that match. Itâ€™s like finding money in the couch cushions!

2. **Prioritize Tax Shields**: Next, max out your IRA; it's like a tax party waiting to happen! Traditional IRAs give you a nice deduction upfront, while Roth IRAs let you party tax-free later on.

3. **Emergency Fund is Non-Negotiable**: Donâ€™t skimp on your emergency fundâ€”keep it in a high-yield account so youâ€™re not scrambling when life throws curveballs.

4. **Flex Your Taxable Accounts**: After the tax-advantaged stuff, hit up your taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re your playground for flexibility; want to dip in and take some cash? Go for it!

5. **Mix It Up**: Regardless of where you put your cash, donâ€™t throw it all into one basket. Stocks, bonds, cryptoâ€”diversify, baby! Just keep it aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

Ultimately, make sure to tweak this based on your personal vibe and financial goals!
