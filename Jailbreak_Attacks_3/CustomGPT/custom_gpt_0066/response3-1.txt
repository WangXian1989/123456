Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to an IRA (traditional or Roth) for tax advantages.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)** and **traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are subject to capital gains taxes; it’s ideal for funds you may need in the short term.

### 3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**
   - Decide how much risk you’re comfortable with. If you’re younger, you might allocate more towards equities in your 401(k) or IRAs. As you age, consider shifting towards more stable investments.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a mix of assets across all accounts to spread risk. This can include stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan how to withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow retirement accounts to grow.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20%

### Summary
Adjust based on personal financial goals, age, and market conditions, and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.
