Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Flexible Withdrawal Rules**: Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals of contributions anytime.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts can be used for short-term goals or emergencies since they don’t have withdrawal penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held for less than a year.

### 4. **General Strategy**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid reserves before investing heavily.
   - **Investment Goals**: Align distribution with your timeline (short-term vs. long-term).
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Diversify investments within each account according to your comfort level.

### Summary
- **Prioritize 401(k) contributions** to any match.
- **Utilize IRAs for tax advantages**, choosing the type based on your anticipated tax bracket at retirement.
- **Use taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity**, focusing on tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains.
