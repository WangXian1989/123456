To provide you with tailored financial advice regarding the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, could you please clarify the following:

1. What are your financial goals (e.g., retirement savings, short-term needs, etc.)?
2. What is your current age and anticipated retirement age?
3. Are you contributing to all three types of accounts currently?
4. Do you have any employer matching for your 401(k)?
5. What is your risk tolerance (e.g., conservative, moderate, aggressive)?

With this information, I can give you a more specific and helpful strategy!
