To provide you with the best advice on how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, could you please clarify a few things?

1. What are your financial goals (e.g., retirement, buying a house, etc.)?
2. What is your current age and risk tolerance (conservative, moderate, aggressive)?
3. Are you currently contributing to any of these accounts, and if so, how much? 
4. Do you have any specific tax considerations or concerns?

Feel free to provide a website or any other information that can help me understand your situation better!
