Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should align with your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for both 401(k)s and IRAs. After maximizing the match, consider contributing to an IRA if you haven't reached the limit.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, growing tax-deferred. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax on profits. Use them for investments you might need to access before retirement to avoid penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider utilizing tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.
   - Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high turnover funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**:
   - Keep an emergency fund in easily accessible accounts separate from retirement funds. Ensure you can cover short-term needs without penalties.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance, balancing stocks, bonds, and other investments across all accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly assess your contributions and investment performance. Adjust allocations as your financial situation changes, such as salary increases or changes in financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure, seek advice from a financial professional for personalized strategies.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively distribute your money among your retirement accounts while considering tax implications and your long-term financial goals.
