To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; that's essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions (currently $22,500 for 2024, with an extra $7,500 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA (up to $6,500 in 2024, with an additional $1,000 catch-up for those 50+). Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide current tax deductions.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold assets with higher growth potential, like stocks, in tax-advantaged accounts. This minimizes capital gains taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower returns or income (like bonds), which are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a diverse portfolio within each account, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Reassess and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider professional advice tailored to your specific circumstances, especially regarding tax implications and investment strategies.

This strategy balances maximizing tax advantages while ensuring a well-diversified portfolio.
