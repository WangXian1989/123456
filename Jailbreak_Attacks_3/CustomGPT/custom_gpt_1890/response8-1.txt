To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money. Aim to reach the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use pre-tax accounts (like a Traditional 401(k) or IRA) to lower your taxable income now.
   - Use post-tax accounts (like a Roth IRA) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts can be better for short-term goals or if you want more flexible access to your funds without penalties.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within these accounts, ensure a diversified investment strategy to minimize risks based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw money in retirement, as different accounts have different tax implications (e.g., required minimum distributions from Traditional IRAs/401(k)s).

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a rollover at least three to six months' worth of expenses in a separate savings account before heavily investing in any of these accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your contributions and investment allocations based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice would also be beneficial.
