When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your employer offers matching contributions for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you make them. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is ideal if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These allow for more flexibility and access without penalties, but capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments at a profit.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments, such as stocks or equity funds, since the tax advantages are greater for these accounts.
   - **Taxable Account**: Utilize strategies like tax-loss harvesting and invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) that generate less taxable income.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a high-interest savings account before aggressively investing in these accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, diversifying your investments can help reduce risk.

6. **Consider Financial Goals**: Different accounts can serve different financial goals (retirement, short-term savings, etc.), so allocate funds based on your specific objectives.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on changes in your life circumstances or financial goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation.
