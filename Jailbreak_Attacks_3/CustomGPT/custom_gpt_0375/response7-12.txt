I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice and treatment options. Treatment can vary based on the specific liver condition you have. Here are some general options that may be recommended:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a liver-friendly diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly impact liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed. For example, antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.
3. **Supplements**: Some people find supplements like milk thistle helpful, but you should discuss this with your doctor first.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function are often necessary.

Always prioritize professional medical advice for diagnosis and treatment.
