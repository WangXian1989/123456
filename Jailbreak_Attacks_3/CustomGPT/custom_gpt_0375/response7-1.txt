Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts efficiently depends on factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general principles:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start with your 401(k). If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match before moving on to other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Max out 401(k)**: Once you've contributed to the IRA, if you can, go back to your 401(k) and consider maximizing contributions up to the annual limit. This is particularly important if your 401(k) offers low-cost institutional investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, if you've maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts and want to invest more, look into taxable accounts. This is especially useful for investment strategies that require flexibility or for shorter-term goals.

5. **Consider tax implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications. Investments in tax-advantaged accounts grow tax-deferred, and with a Roth, they can grow tax-free. In taxable accounts, you'll need to pay capital gains tax on earnings when you sell.

6. **Diversification of Investments**: Maintain a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different accounts can hold different types of investments. For example, you might want to hold more riskier assets in your tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in your taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and interest.

7. **Ongoing Review and Adjustment**: Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals.

In summary, the best distribution strategy among these accounts typically involves maximizing employer matches in your 401(k), fully funding an IRA, and then contributing to taxable accounts as your budget allows. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
