When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account your financial goals, investment strategies, tax implications, and your overall investment timeline. Here are some guidelines you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), it's generally a good idea to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to IRA Accounts**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Depending on your income, you may be eligible for a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA, which may provide tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in a taxable account. This offers more flexibility for withdrawals and does not have the same penalties for early withdrawal as retirement accounts. However, be aware of the tax implications on any capital gains and dividends.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: In taxable accounts, focus on holding investments that are more tax-efficient (e.g., index funds or ETFs that generate fewer taxable events) and consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation, goals, and the economic environment can change, so it’s important to reassess your distribution strategy periodically. 

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: If you’re unsure about the best strategy for your situation, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation.

Remember, the optimal distribution can vary greatly depending on individual circumstances, such as your income, tax bracket, expected retirement age, and risk tolerance.
