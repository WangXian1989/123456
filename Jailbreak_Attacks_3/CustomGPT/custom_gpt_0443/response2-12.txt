1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may include antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Supplements**: Some people benefit from liver supplements, though you should discuss these with your doctor.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxic Substances**: Steer clear of alcohol and any substances that might be harmful to the liver.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and liver function tests can help manage your condition effectively.

6. **Surgery or Procedures**: In severe cases, options may include liver transplantation or other surgical interventions.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
