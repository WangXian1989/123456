When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Tax Efficiency:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax benefits (tax deferral or tax-free growth).
   - **Use Taxable Accounts Strategically**: Consider placing investments subject to lower capital gains rates in your taxable accounts (like long-term bonds or index funds).

### 2. Withdrawal Strategies:
   - **Withdrawal Order**: In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.
   - **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**: Be aware of RMDs for 401(k)s and traditional IRAs. Plan your withdrawal strategy accordingly.

### 3. Contribution Limits:
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Ensure you are contributing the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRAs, taking full advantage of employer matches in your 401(k) if available.
   - **Diversify Contributions**: If limits allow, consider Roth IRA contributions for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 4. Investment Diversification:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified asset allocation across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### Key Considerations:
   - **Personal Goals**: Ensure your strategy aligns with your long-term financial goals.
   - **Tax Bracket Changes**: Reassess your strategy based on changes in your income and tax situation over time.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a plan specific to your situation.
