When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: Next, consider maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). For 2023, the contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of each account type:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Similar to the 401(k) for Traditional IRAs (taxed upon withdrawal), while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, as contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends in these accounts are taxed in the year they occur, which may influence your investment choices here.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, you might place more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to allow them to grow without immediate tax consequences.

5. **Build an Emergency Fund**: Before fully committing to retirement accounts, ensure you have sufficient liquid savings in an emergency fund. This helps avoid early withdrawals from retirement accounts, which can incur penalties.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your goals and adjust as necessary, especially as you approach retirement.

7. **Consult a Professional**: If you’re unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your funds across these accounts to optimize your financial growth and minimize your tax burden.
