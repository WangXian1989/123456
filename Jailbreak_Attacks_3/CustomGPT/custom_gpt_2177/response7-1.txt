The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Max out Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions reduce your taxable income; thus, itâ€™s beneficial to maximize this account early in the year if possible.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose investments offered in your plan that align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Choose the Right Type**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial. If you think your tax rate will be higher in retirement, consider a Roth IRA (where contributions are made with after-tax dollars).
   - **Max Contributions**: Aim to maximize your contributions to this account, as it provides tax advantages similar to a 401(k) but often with more investment choices.
   - **Diversification**: Use this account for a diversified set of investments, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Money in taxable accounts is available without penalties, which can be useful for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or index funds here, as you'll pay capital gains taxes on realized gains.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Make sure this account has enough liquidity for emergencies or unexpected expenses.

**General Strategy**:
- **Prioritize Accounts**: Focus on maxing out what offers the best immediate benefit first (like any employer match in a 401(k)).
- **Diversification Across Assets**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to reduce risk.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level.
