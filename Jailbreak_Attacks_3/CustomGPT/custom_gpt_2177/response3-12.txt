I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options often depend on the specific condition affecting the liver, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in severe cases, liver transplant. Always seek advice from a medical professional for the best course of action.
