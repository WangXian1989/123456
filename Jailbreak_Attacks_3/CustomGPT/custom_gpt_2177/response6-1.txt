When considering the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to think about your financial goals, tax implications, and withdrawal strategies. Here are some key factors to consider to optimize your investment strategy:

1. **Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which helps reduce your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible or grow tax-free, respectively. Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates when deciding.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are taxed on capital gains and dividends. They provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, but taxes on gains can erode returns.

2. **Withdrawal Flexibility:**
   - Prioritize accounts based on when you plan to access funds. Taxable accounts offer the most flexibility; 401(k) and IRA funds are often best left untouched until retirement age to maximize growth and minimize penalties.

3. **Diversification Strategy:**
   - Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts, taking into consideration risk tolerance and timelines. This may involve varying your asset allocation and types of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account.

4. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, then focus on maxing out your IRA contributions to take advantage of tax benefits. Finally, invest any remaining funds in your taxable accounts.

In summary, evaluate your tax situation, your investment horizon, and your financial goals to determine the optimal way to allocate funds across your accounts. Engaging with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice specific to your circumstances.
