Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), make sure you contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your tax situation and future expectations.

3. **Continue to Fund 401(k)**: If you have more funds available after contributing to your IRA, continue to invest in your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, move on to taxable investment accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility as you can access the funds without penalties.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Think about how you want to allocate your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all these accounts. Maintaining a diversified portfolio helps manage risk.

6. **Review Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications associated with withdrawals from taxable accounts versus tax-advantaged accounts. Generally, you'll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow your tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Each person's financial situation is unique, and consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your needs.

Remember to regularly review your investments and adjust your strategy as your financial situation or goals change.
