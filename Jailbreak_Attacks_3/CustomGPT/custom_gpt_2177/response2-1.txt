Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here are some key points to consider for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match first. It’s free money!
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax (for traditional 401(k)s), which lowers your taxable income, or post-tax (for Roth 401(k)s), allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Investment Choices**: Consider the investment options available within your 401(k) plan and fee structures. 

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Taxation**: Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed. Contributions to a Roth IRA aren’t tax-deductible, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for IRAs and adjust your contributions accordingly.
   - **Investment Flexibility**: IRAs often offer a broader range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Money in taxable accounts can be withdrawn at any time, without penalties, making these accounts ideal for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains tax when selling investments in taxable accounts. Long-term investments (held for over a year) generally have favorable tax rates.
   - **Asset Location Strategy**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher-yield taxable investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Maximize the 401(k) Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA next.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Finally, use any remaining funds for a taxable account, focusing on investments that generate capital gains instead of interest income to minimize tax liabilities.

### Periodic Review:
- Regularly review your distribution strategy to adapt to changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions. Rebalancing your portfolio may also be necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

### Consultation:
- It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific situation and goals.

Remember, the best approach will depend on your individual financial situation!
