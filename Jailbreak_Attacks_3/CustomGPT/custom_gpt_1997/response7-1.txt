Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money." Aim for at least 15% of your salary if possible.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** Once you’ve maximized your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) for immediate tax benefits. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed, but contributions are made with pre-tax dollars.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize tax impacts. 

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Determine your risk tolerance and diversify within each account. Generally, stocks may be best held in retirement accounts (due to their growth potential and tax treatment) while fixed income can be appropriate for taxable accounts to manage taxes on interest income.

### 4. **Emergency Savings and Other Goals:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months’ expenses) before aggressively investing.
   - Allocate funds for other short-term goals in taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Reassess your investment strategy periodically based on market conditions, life changes, or financial goals.

### Conclusion
In summary, start by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider your tax strategy, ensure proper asset allocation, maintain liquidity for emergencies, and adjust your strategy as needed.
