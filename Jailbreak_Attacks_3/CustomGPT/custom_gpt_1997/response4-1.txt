Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contribution. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Utilize IRAs for Tax Benefits**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA if you want to reduce your taxable income now. Taxes will be owed on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, particularly if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Assess Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for funds you may need access to before retirement age. They offer more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Focus on tax-efficient investments here, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to limit the tax impact.

### 4. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**
   - **Asset Location:** Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRAs) and keep tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Short-term Needs:** If you need money in the next few years, prioritize investing in taxable accounts.
   - **Long-term Growth:** For long-term growth, prioritize maxing out retirement accounts first, then allocate excess funds to taxable accounts.

### 6. **Continuous Reassessment**
   - **Annual Review:** Regularly review your allocation strategy to account for changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations tailored to your specific situation.
