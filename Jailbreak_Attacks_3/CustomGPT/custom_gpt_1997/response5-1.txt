Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Max Out Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; it's essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the limit for employee contributions is $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50 or older). Balance contributions between a 401(k) and an IRA based on your overall strategy.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth:** Contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Maximize Contributions:** The annual limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500 ($7,500 if 50 or older).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest in Tax-Efficient Assets:** Use taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient, like stocks or index funds, which benefit from long-term capital gains.
   - **Consider Emergency Fund Needs:** Keep liquid investments for immediate access or life changes without penalties.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify across all accounts. For example, riskier assets like stocks can dominate in taxable accounts while maintaining safer investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Monitor and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in financial goals.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize tax implications. Typically, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can be beneficial.

Consulting a financial advisor can further tailor this strategy to your unique situation.
