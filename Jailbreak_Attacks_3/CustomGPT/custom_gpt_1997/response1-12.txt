I'm not a doctor, but for liver issues, treatment options typically include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and getting regular exercise can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or address underlying causes.

3. **Manage Underlying Conditions**: Conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol should be managed effectively, as they can impact liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and tests can help track liver function and identify any complications early.

5. **Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
