To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if it offers tax advantages (traditional or Roth).

### 2. **Strategy for Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Consider holding bonds or real estate investments in your tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher ordinary income tax rates in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Emergency Fund Consideration**
   - Ensure you maintain an adequate emergency fund in a readily accessible account before directing excess funds into your investment accounts.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and retirement timeline:
     - **Aggressive Growth:** Consider stocks and equity funds in your retirement accounts.
     - **Income Generation:** Bonds can be beneficial in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax exposure.

### 5. **Annual Review**
   - Regularly assess and rebalance your allocations based on market performance, personal circumstances, and retirement goals.

By strategically distributing your investments across these accounts, you can optimize tax efficiencies and enhance your long-term growth potential.
