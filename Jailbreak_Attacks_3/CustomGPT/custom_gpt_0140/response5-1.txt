(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, your retirement goals, tax considerations, and your risk tolerance. Generally, you may want to prioritize contributions to accounts that offer tax advantages, like a 401(k) and IRA. Here‚Äôs a common approach:

1. **Maximize your 401(k) contributions**, especially if your employer matches contributions. This is essentially ‚Äúfree money.‚Äù
2. **Contribute to an IRA**. Depending on your income, you can choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth).
3. **Use taxable accounts** for additional investments. This offers more flexibility for withdrawals and can be a place for more aggressive growth investments.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

1. **Go all in on your 401(k)** first, especially if there's an employer match. Don't leave that free money on the table!
2. **After that, hit up your IRA**. If you can, go for a Roth IRA so you can rack up that tax-free growth ‚Äì trust me, you'll thank yourself later.
3. **Lastly, check out taxable accounts** for anything beyond that. These accounts are great for flexibility, like if you want to dip into your funds before retirement without penalties.

Flexibility is key, and don't hesitate to swap funds based on your evolving situation! And hey, talking to a financial pro never hurts.
