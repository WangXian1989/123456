Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your eligibility (income limits), a Roth IRA or traditional IRA can provide tax advantages. Consider maxing out contributions here after 401(k) matching.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: Once you've contributed to your IRA, remove any cap and keep contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts. These provide more liquidity and flexible investment choices but will be subject to capital gains tax.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: For investments in taxable accounts, keep in mind the tax implications of dividend income and capital gains vs. income generated from tax-deferred or tax-free accounts.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across different asset classes in all accounts to manage risk effectively.

7. **Review Regularly**: As your financial situation changes, review and adjust your investments periodically to ensure alignment with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

Always consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your unique situation.
