Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages that can boost your savings.

### 3. **Return to 401(k) Contributions**
   - If you still have funds available after maxing out your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) to max out contributions (up to the annual limit).

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings. These are flexible and can offer tax-efficient investment options, like index funds or ETFs.

### 5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes to manage risk. The allocation strategy may vary based on your age, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.

### 6. **Tax Considerations**
   - Be mindful of tax implications for each type of account. For example, tax-efficient investments are better in taxable accounts, while higher-growth investments may benefit from tax-advantaged accounts.

### 7. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and align with changes in your goals or market conditions.

### Summary
A balanced approach often involves prioritizing retirement accounts for their tax advantages while also leveraging taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Consulting a financial advisor is advisable for personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.
