Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out contributions, focusing on pre-tax contributions if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax strategy; Roth IRAs are tax-free in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest excess funds here after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. This gives you flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diverse mix of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to manage risk.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on performance, contributions, and changing financial goals.
