Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors:

1. **Employer Match**: Maximize your 401(k) contributions to at least get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred growth; contributions are made pre-tax (reducing current taxable income).
   - **IRA**: Similar benefits to a 401(k) but may have different contribution limits and rules (Roth options grow tax-free).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed in the year they're realized; good for money you might need access to before retirement.

3. **Investment Goals**: 
   - For long-term growth, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - For short-term goals or liquidity, focus on your taxable account.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Focus on growth assets (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts.
   - Consider bonds or dividend-paying investments in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of assets across all accounts based on risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Regular Review**: Rebalance periodically to maintain desired asset allocation and adjust based on life changes, goals, and market conditions.
