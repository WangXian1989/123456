Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here’s a basic framework:

1. **401(k)**: This account is often beneficial to max out, especially if your employer offers a match. Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), and the account grows tax-deferred.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, an IRA (either traditional or Roth) offers tax advantages. Depending on your income level, maxing out your IRA can be a great idea, especially regarding tax diversification.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible for withdrawals and don’t have contribution limits, but they don’t offer the same tax advantages. They might be suitable for investments that produce capital gains rather than interest income, as long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

**General Tips**:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: If you have a 401(k) with a match, contribute enough to get the full match.
- **Tax Considerations**: Consider contributing to tax-advantaged accounts first before taxable ones.
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain some liquidity outside these accounts for emergencies.
  
Reassess your distribution regularly to align with changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.
