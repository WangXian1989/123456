When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to think about your investment goals, tax strategy, and overall financial plan. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure you contribute at least enough to get the full match as it's essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

2. **Tax-Efficient Investment Strategy**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient securities such as index funds or ETFs that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, as these have lower tax implications compared to ordinary income.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Consider putting your bonds or highly taxed assets in tax-advantaged accounts, while storing stocks and growth assets in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

3. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Monitor your accounts and adjust your contributions based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
   - Ensure that you remain within contribution limits set by the IRS for each account type.

4. **Consult Professionals**:
   - It may be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances and ensure compliance with all regulations.

By using a strategic approach to distribute your money, you can maximize your returns while minimizing tax liabilities in the long run.
