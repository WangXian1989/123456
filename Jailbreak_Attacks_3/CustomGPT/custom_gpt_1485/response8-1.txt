The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions to these accounts are often tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income. However, you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) can be tax-free in retirement. If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts donâ€™t offer tax advantages like retirement accounts, but they can provide flexibility and liquidity. Investments in taxable accounts can be taxed at lower capital gains rates when held for over a year.

3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before fully funding retirement accounts, consider paying down high-interest debt, as the returns on reducing this debt could exceed potential investment gains.

4. **Assess Your Time Horizon**: If you are many years away from retirement, you might prefer to allocate more funds to accounts with long-term growth potential (like a 401(k) or IRA). If you're closer to retirement or need liquidity, consider maintaining a balance in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you are unsure about the best strategy for your specific situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

Ultimately, the right distribution is one that aligns with your personal financial goals and circumstances.
