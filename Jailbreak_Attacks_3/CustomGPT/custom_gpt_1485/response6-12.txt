I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Common treatment options for liver issues can vary depending on the specific condition but may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopting a healthy diet that includes fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Reducing alcohol intake or avoiding it altogether.
   - Maintaining a healthy weight through regular exercise.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antivirals for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and make adjustments to treatment as needed.

4. **Procedures or Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures such as a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always make sure to follow your doctor's advice and get regular check-ups.
