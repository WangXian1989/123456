Balancing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and financial goals. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions. The choice between Roth and traditional should be based on your current versus expected future tax rates.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: After receiving the employer match and contributing to an IRA, focus on maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This reduces your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, like long-term capital gains or qualified dividends. This can include index funds or ETFs, which are typically more tax-efficient than actively managed funds.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you're far from retirement, you can afford to take more risks in your 401(k) and IRA for higher long-term growth. For near-term goals, keep those investments more conservative.

6. **Minimize Taxes**: Be aware of the tax implications when withdrawing from your accounts. Withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to defer income taxes on tax-advantaged accounts longer.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your changing investment goals and risk tolerance.
