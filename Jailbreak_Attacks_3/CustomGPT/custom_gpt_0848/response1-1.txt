Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Traditional accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA) offer tax-deferred growth but tax you on withdrawals. Roth accounts provide tax-free growth but require after-tax contributions.
   - A taxable account can be beneficial for money you might need in the short term or for tax-loss harvesting.

3. **Diversifying Investments**:
   - Aim for a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level.
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Account Accessibility**:
   - Consider when youâ€™ll need to access the funds. Retirement accounts often have penalties for early withdrawals.

5. **Rebalance as Necessary**:
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and adjust contributions to maintain your strategy.

It's often wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
