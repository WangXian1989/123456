Distributing funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a balanced approach:

1. **401(k):** 
   - Maximize employer match: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
   - Consider contribution limits: For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you’re over 50).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - Prioritize tax benefits: A traditional IRA offers potential tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Contribution limits: For 2024, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re over 50). 

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Invest for flexibility: These accounts offer the most flexibility with withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on earnings.
   - Efficient investing: Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or tax-exempt municipal bonds.

### General Strategy:
- **Short-term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for funds needed soon.
- **Medium to Long-term Goals:** Prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA) before putting additional funds into taxable accounts.
- **Diversification:** Ensure a balanced investment strategy across all accounts for risk management.

### Regular Review:
Reassess your distribution annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor could provide personalized insights.
