Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max out IRA contributions** if eligible, as they offer potential tax deductions or tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA).
   - Continue funding your 401(k) up to the contribution limit after receiving employer match benefits.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. Use these accounts for funds you may need in the short term.
   - Shift higher-performing assets that generate significant taxable income (like bonds) into tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Balance Based on Timing**:
   - **Short-term Needs**: Keep enough liquid in taxable accounts for emergencies or planned expenses.
   - **Long-term Growth**: Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts for retirement to benefit from compounding without immediate tax implications.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: As you get closer to retirement, consider shifting asset allocations in your accounts to lower risk and ensure you are not overly exposed to equities.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, especially considering your unique situation and goals, a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies.

Remember to periodically reassess your contributions and allocations as your financial situation evolves.
