Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit, especially if you receive a match.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional), focusing on tax benefits. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to these accounts, direct any additional savings to a taxable investment account. This is useful for flexibility and emergency funds.

4. **Consider Tax Diversification**: Aim for a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA), tax-free (Roth IRA), and taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility in retirement to choose how to withdraw funds in a tax-efficient manner.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Tailor your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, higher-risk investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts where growth is tax-deferred.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations annually or when your financial situation changes to ensure alignment with your goals.

7. **Consult a Professional**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your money among your different accounts to maximize growth and minimize tax liability.
