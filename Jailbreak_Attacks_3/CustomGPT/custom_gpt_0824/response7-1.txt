The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider IRA Contributions**
   - **Tax Benefits**: If youâ€™re eligible, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth). Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for both types of IRAs.

### 3. **Fund Your 401(k) Beyond the Match**
   - **Increase Contributions**: If you can afford it, increase your 401(k) contributions beyond the match. This can be beneficial for tax-deferred growth.

### 4. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in cash or liquid assets.
   - **Invest for Goals**: Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or to invest in assets that may not be suitable for tax-advantaged accounts (like municipal bonds).

### 5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - **Invest Wisely**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk. Consider your overall asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.

### 6. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - **Adjustment**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals.

### Conclusion
Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique financial situation and goals.
