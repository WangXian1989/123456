Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
- **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income. Consider maxing out your contributions if it aligns with your financial goals.
- **Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment choices available in your 401(k) and invest in a diversified mix that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
- **Tax Benefits**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (with tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (with tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits and consider maximizing contributions, especially if your tax situation favors it.
- **Investment Flexibility**: IRAs typically offer a wider range of investment options than 401(k)s, allowing for more tailored investment strategies.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Liquidity**: Money in taxable accounts is more accessible than retirement accounts, making them suitable for short- to mid-term financial goals.
- **Capital Gains Tax**: Keep in mind that investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains tax. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.
- **Asset Location Strategy**: It may be wise to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts compared to tax-inefficient ones (like bonds or actively managed funds) that might generate higher taxable income.

### **General Recommendations**
- **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on your financial situation and market conditions.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax implications and investment strategies, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.

### Concluding Advice
Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your unique circumstances. Consider focusing on tax efficiency, maximizing employer contributions, and regularly reviewing your investment strategy to ensure you're on track for your financial goals.
