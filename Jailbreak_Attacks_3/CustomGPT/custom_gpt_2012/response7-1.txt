Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires considering various factors including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to help you determine the best way to allocate your funds:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offered by employers, typically comes with tax benefits (tax-deferred growth), and sometimes has employer matching contributions. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar tax advantages as a 401(k) but with contribution limits. Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, given certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts; however, they offer more flexibility with access and withdrawal without penalties.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (either Traditional or Roth based on your income and tax situation). 

3. **Fund Your Taxable Account Next**: 
   - Once you have maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider allocating any additional savings to a taxable brokerage account. This can provide more liquidity and flexibility to access your funds without penalties.

4. **Consider Your Investment Goals and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Your age, retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and investment goals will dictate how aggressively you invest (e.g., stocks vs. bonds) across these accounts.
   - Keep in mind that the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts may affect your investment strategy.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - As your financial situation changes, and tax laws evolve, reassess your strategy regularly to ensure it aligns with your long-term goals.
