Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money" and is a great starting point.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now (traditional) but are taxed when you withdraw in retirement. Some plans offer Roth options, where you pay taxes now, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals. Choose based on your current tax situation and expected retirement tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, which can impact your returns. However, these accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be beneficial for short-term goals.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each type of account to manage risk while aiming for growth. Consider placing high-growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize compounding.

### 4. **Prioritize Debt Repayment**
   - If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying it down before heavily investing, as the interest costs can outweigh potential investment gains.

### 5. **Determine Your Retirement Timeline**
   - If retirement is many years away, you may want to take more risks with investments in tax-advantaged accounts. Conversely, if you plan to retire soon, you might shift toward more conservative investments.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically review your investment allocations and adjust as necessary based on changes in the market, your financial situation, or life events.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match.
- Once matched, consider the following allocation:
  - **401(k)**: 15-20% of your income, focus on stocks.
  - **IRA**: Roth or Traditional IRA with at least 10-15% of income, balance between stocks and bonds.
  - **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds, allocate here as appropriate (e.g., 5-10%), focusing on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

### Conclusion:
The optimal distribution varies for each individual. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation and goals.
