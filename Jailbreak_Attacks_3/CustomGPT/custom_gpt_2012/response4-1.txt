When considering the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors such as your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), itâ€™s generally advisable to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth with potential tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax and income tax on dividends, but they offer more flexibility and access.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your money is spread out across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and account types (tax-deferred and taxable) to minimize risks and optimize returns.

4. **Retirement Timeline**: Your age and how close you are to retirement play a significant role. Younger investors may benefit from aggressive growth in taxable and tax-advantaged accounts, while those nearing retirement may want to shift toward more conservative investments.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw money in retirement. Having a mix of account types can provide flexibility for tax-efficient withdrawals.

6. **Personal Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your short-term and long-term goals, adjusting contributions to each account based on when you will need the funds.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be wise to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy tailored to your financial situation and goals.

Ultimately, the "best" way to distribute your money will depend on your individual circumstances and financial objectives.
