The optimal distribution of your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your individual financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: This is a workplace retirement plan that often includes employer matching contributions. Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: This can be a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes paid upon withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (contributions made with after-tax dollars, withdrawals are tax-free in retirement). 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts have no tax advantages. Investment income and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA if they offer tax benefits. For instance, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Investment Growth**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) since they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Consider placing more stable income-generating investments (like bonds) in a taxable account, as they may have a lower tax impact if held long-term.

4. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - In retirement, your tax rate may be lower than when you are working, so consider the impact of withdrawing funds from pre-tax accounts (like a 401(k) and traditional IRA) versus tax-free withdrawals from a Roth IRA.

5. **Account for Liquidity Needs**:
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity for short-term needs. Taxable accounts can provide funds without early withdrawal penalties, unlike retirement accounts which may have restrictions.

6. **Annual Review**:
   - Regularly review your investment strategy and account allocations as your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws change.

A well-diversified portfolio tailored to your specific situation will help you maximize returns while managing risks effectively. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
