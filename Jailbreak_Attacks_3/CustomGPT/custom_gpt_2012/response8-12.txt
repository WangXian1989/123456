I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems. However, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be used to treat inflammation or infections.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption can prevent further liver damage and aid recovery.

4. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Conditions such as diabetes, high cholesterol, or hypertension need to be managed to protect liver health.

5. **Vitamins and Supplements**: Some individuals might benefit from specific vitamins or supplements, but only under medical supervision.

6. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and monitoring liver function tests are essential to track the progress and adjust treatment as necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for advice tailored to your specific situation and needs.
