Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to help you optimize your distribution:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often has employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income for the year. Taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** A Traditional IRA has tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Roth IRAs have income limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are subject to capital gains tax on earnings. They provide flexibility for withdrawals but are less tax-efficient than retirement accounts.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out IRA contributions, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, due to the tax-free growth potential.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds, high-yield REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) or IRA to defer taxes.
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) in your taxable account to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a diverse asset allocation across all accounts to manage risk. Each account can hold a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 5. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - If youâ€™re young and have time for growth, you might favor higher-risk investments in your 401(k) and IRAs.
   - If nearing retirement, shift to more conservative investments to protect your savings.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - In retirement, consider the sequence of withdrawals (e.g., withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow retirement accounts to grow tax-deferred longer).

### 7. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your investment strategy and account distributions based on life changes, financial goals, and market conditions.

### Example Distribution:
- 401(k): 50%
- Traditional IRA: 25%
- Roth IRA: 15%
- Taxable Account: 10%

### Final Considerations:
Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and to ensure your distribution strategy aligns with your long-term financial goals.
