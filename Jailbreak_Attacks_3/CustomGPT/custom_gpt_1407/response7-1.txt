Distributing your money effectively across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for a balanced investment strategy. Here are key considerations for each account type:

### 1. 401(k) Plan
- **Employer Match**: Prioritize contributions to maximize any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
- **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income and allows your savings to grow tax-deferred. Consider maxing out your contributions if financially feasible.

### 2. IRA (Traditional or Roth)
- **Tax Strategy**:
  - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible. Good if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
  - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Ideal if you expect your tax rate to rise.
- **Contribution Limits**: Stay aware of annual contribution limits and age catch-up contributions if applicable.

### 3. Taxable Accounts
- **Flexibility**: Provides access to funds without penalties, making it a good choice for short-term goals or emergencies.
- **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Prioritize investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### Distribution Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund before significantly investing in these accounts.
- **Balance Risk and Return**: Depending on your age, financial goals, and risk tolerance, adjust your asset allocation within each account. Younger investors might lean toward stocks, while those closer to retirement may prefer bonds or low-risk investments.
- **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your allocations regularly to maintain your intended risk level and adapt to changing financial situations or market conditions.

### Example Allocation
- Early Career: 50% 401(k), 30% IRA, 20% Taxable
- Mid-Career: 40% 401(k), 40% IRA, 20% Taxable
- Pre-Retirement: 30% 401(k), 30% IRA, 40% Taxable
