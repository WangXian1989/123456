Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you can, contribute to your 401(k) up to the legal limit, especially if you receive a match. 
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

3. **Investment in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This can provide more liquidity and flexibility since you won't face the same penalties or restrictions as with retirement accounts.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. Roth accounts involve after-tax contributions but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, Roth contributions may be more beneficial.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Adjust as You Go**:
   - Review and adjust your strategy periodically as your financial situation changes, market conditions fluctuate, or as you move closer to retirement.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
