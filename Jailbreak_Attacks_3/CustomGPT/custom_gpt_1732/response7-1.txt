When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to take into account several factors including your financial goals, tax implications, investment horizon, and retirement plans. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great starting point.

2. **Traditional vs. Roth Accounts**: Decide whether you want to contribute to a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). This choice may depend on your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind that withdrawals from traditional accounts during retirement will be taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free. Taxable accounts are taxed on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Think about your overall investment strategy. Tax-advantaged accounts are usually ideal for investments that you expect to grow significantly, as you won’t be taxed on capital gains until withdrawal (in traditional accounts).

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are balanced across different account types to mitigate risk. For example, you might hold more bonds in a taxable account to minimize tax impact, while stock investments with higher growth potential can be in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. It may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue to grow.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize the employer match. If possible, consider additional contributions up to the annual limit.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your match in the 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA based on your eligibility. A Roth IRA can be a great option if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility, especially if you may need funds before retirement.

### Regular Reassessment:
Regularly reassess your allocation based on your personal circumstances, market conditions, and changes in tax laws. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your savings and investments for both growth and tax efficiency.
