To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

### 1. **Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, you will pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), you can defer taxes on contributions until retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed annually on dividends and realized gains. Long-term capital gains may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 2. **Contribution Limits**
   - 401(k) and IRAs both have annual contribution limits. Ensure you maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts before using taxable accounts.
   
### 3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - Determine your investment objectives. Longer time horizons may allow for more aggressive investments, particularly in tax-advantaged accounts where growth can compound without immediate tax implications.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **Max out your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match, as it's essentially free money.
- **Fund an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation and goals.
- **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maxed your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts for more liquidity and investment flexibility.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: Contributions up to the employer match or the contribution limit
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed, considering whether it should be a Roth or Traditional IRA
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use remaining funds for additional investments, targeting tax-efficient funds to minimize tax liabilities

### Important Considerations
- Review investment fees and expenses in each account type.
- Regularly rebalance your asset allocation based on market conditions and personal financial goals.

This approach will help you optimize your investment strategy for tax efficiency and growth potential over the long term.
