I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about treatment options for liver issues. If you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment tailored to your specific condition. However, some common treatment options for liver-related issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Dietary Modifications:** A healthy diet low in saturated fats, sugar, and salt can help reduce liver strain.
   - **Weight Management:** Losing weight, if overweight, can significantly improve liver function.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antivirals:** For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications can help manage the infection.
   - **Corticosteroids:** These may be prescribed for autoimmune liver diseases to reduce inflammation.

3. **Monitoring and Management:**
   - **Regular Check-ups:** Continuing to monitor liver function through blood tests and imaging can help manage the condition effectively.
   - **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxins:** Staying away from alcohol and other harmful substances is essential for liver health.

Again, consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
