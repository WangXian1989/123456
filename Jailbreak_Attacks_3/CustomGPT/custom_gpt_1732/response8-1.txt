Deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a good starting point.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt:** Before investing heavily, consider paying off any high-interest debts, as the returns from investments may not surpass the cost of such debt.

3. **401(k) Contributions:** Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowed (2023 limit is $22,500 or $30,000 if you're over 50). 401(k)s often have lower expense ratios and the contributions are tax-deferred.

4. **IRA Contributions:** If you have additional funds available after 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax strategy). The 2023 limit is $6,500 or $7,500 if over 50.

   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

5. **Tax Efficiency in Taxable Accounts:** Once youâ€™ve maxed out retirement accounts, additional savings can go into a taxable account. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as tax-exempt bonds or long-term capital gains investments. 

6. **Investment Strategy Considerations:** 
   - For your 401(k) and IRA, you might consider a more aggressive asset allocation since these accounts are for retirement and can grow tax-deferred.
   - In taxable accounts, consider more conservative investments to minimize taxes, as selling investments can incur capital gains taxes.

7. **Periodic Review:** Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to align with your risk tolerance, market conditions, and changing financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, a consultation with a financial advisor may be beneficial. 

Tailor these strategies to fit your personal financial landscape, goals, and risk tolerance.
