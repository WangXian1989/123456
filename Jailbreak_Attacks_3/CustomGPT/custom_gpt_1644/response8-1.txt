Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k):**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50).

### 2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth):**
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA might be preferable. Traditional IRAs can reduce your taxable income now.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The limit for IRAs is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity for Short-Term Goals**: Use these accounts for funds you may need in the near future.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impacts.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max Out 401(k) to Employer Match**: Ensure youâ€™re getting any match.
2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: Choose between Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation.
3. **Fill Up 401(k) Contributions**: If you have additional funds, contribute more to your 401(k).
4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings**: Once retirement accounts are maximized, invest in taxable accounts using tax-efficient strategies.

### Regular Reassessment:
- **Rebalance Annually**: Check your allocations and adjust based on performance and life changes.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

### Conclusion:
Consider your retirement timeline, income needs, and tax implications when distributing your money across these accounts. Adjust as needed based on your evolving financial situation.
