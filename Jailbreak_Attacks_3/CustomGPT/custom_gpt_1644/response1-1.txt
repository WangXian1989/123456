Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages. If eligible, a Roth may be more beneficial for long-term growth.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: After funding your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any extra savings can go into a taxable account. These offer flexibility but come with tax obligations on earnings.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon, regardless of account type. Stocks for growth, bonds for stability.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this to your specific situation.
