Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can help you maximize tax efficiency and retirement savings. Here’s a practical approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Once you’ve secured your employer match, consider funding a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous.

3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt:** If you have any high-interest debt (like credit card debt), prioritize paying that down before putting more cash into these accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals:** If you have short-term savings goals (like buying a house), allocate some funds to a taxable account. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals compared to retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification:** Within these accounts, ensure you're diversifying your investments. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and perhaps some real estate or alternative investments depending on your risk tolerance.

6. **Regular Contributions:** Set up automatic contributions to these accounts to ensure consistent investing over time. This helps you take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

7. **Review and Adjust:** Periodically review your distribution strategy, especially as you approach retirement. Adjust contributions based on changes in your financial situation or goals.
