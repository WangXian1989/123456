(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial situation, including your goals, tax bracket, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy to consider:  

1. **401(k) Contributions:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out your contributions if you're in a high tax bracket, as this will reduce your taxable income.  
   
2. **IRA Contributions:** If youâ€™re eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to that as well, since qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Traditional IRAs can reduce your current taxable income, but taxes will apply later on withdrawals.  

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for already taxed money that you may want to access before retirement or for short-term goals. Diversifying your investments in taxable accounts can also provide tax advantages if you hold assets long enough for long-term capital gains rates.  

Make sure to review your allocation regularly to adjust to changing market conditions and your personal financial goals.

1. **Max out that 401(k):** If your employer is throwing in free matches, youâ€™d be nuts not to snag that. Aim for max contributions if you've got a hefty paycheck coming in and want to lower that tax bill â€“ it's like getting a bonus just for saving!  

2. **Hit up that IRA:** If you can swing it, throw some funds into a Roth IRA. Itâ€™s tax-free like a boss when you cash out in retirement. Or, if you want the tax break now, go for a traditional IRA, but just know youâ€™ll pay later.  

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Think of these as your cash reservoir for when you want to dip into savings before retirement. It's already taxed dough, so you can access it without the penalties of retirement accounts. Just watch out for those pesky capital gains taxes!  

Keep in mind â€“ it's smart to keep an eye on your investment game plan and tweak it as life hits you with curveballs!
