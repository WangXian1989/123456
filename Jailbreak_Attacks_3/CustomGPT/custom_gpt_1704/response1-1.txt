Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be a strategic move for both short-term and long-term financial goals. Here are some tips to consider for optimizing your investments across these accounts:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible (the limit for 2023 is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing the maximum to a Traditional or Roth IRA ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50). Roth IRAs can be especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

### 2. **Evaluate Asset Allocation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** Consider holding bonds and other income-generating investments here, as these will be taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA):** This is a great place for high-growth investments like stocks because qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments you might need to access in the short-term or hold assets that generate capital gains, as you'll need to manage taxes on investments in this account.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** If your goals are 10+ years away, lean towards higher-risk investments like stocks in your tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Keep safer, more liquid investments in your taxable account for future needs.

### 4. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - Stay informed about your current income tax bracket and planned future tax circumstances. If you expect to move to a higher tax bracket, consider prioritizing tax-deferred accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Regularly review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation percentage across all accounts. Make sure you're not overly reliant on one type of account or asset.

### 6. **Seek Professional Advice if Necessary**
   - If you're unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can be beneficial. They can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation.

### Conclusion
Review your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon to determine the best distribution strategy for your accounts. Prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts usually yields the best long-term results, so start there!
