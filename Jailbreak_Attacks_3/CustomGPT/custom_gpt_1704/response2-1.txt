Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly impact your long-term financial growth and tax efficiency. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA (if eligible)**:
   - If you qualify, consider maxing out your Roth IRA contributions. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Assess Your 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After securing the match and contributing to your Roth IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k). This reduces your taxable income and grows tax-deferred.

4. **Review Your Traditional IRA**:
   - If you have the option, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA. Depending on your income level, contributions may be tax-deductible.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts offer flexibility and you can access your funds anytime without early withdrawal penalties.

6. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Aim for a diverse asset allocation across all accounts. Some accounts may be better suited for growth investments (like stocks) while others might focus on income (like bonds).

7. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Think about your current and expected future tax rates. For instance, if you believe you’ll be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.

8. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure alignment with your financial goals.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Individual circumstances vary widely; consider discussing your specific situation with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

By following this structured approach, you can ensure an efficient distribution of your investments across various accounts while keeping tax implications in mind.
