Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax or Roth (after-tax), so consider how this aligns with your current and expected future tax rates.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Diversification**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to both a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) to diversify your tax situation in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits and eligibility requirements.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Investments in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, making them useful for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider holding investments for longer periods to reduce tax implications.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Start with the 401(k)** to get the match.
- Contribute to an IRA if it offers better tax advantages for you.
- Allocate any additional savings to a taxable account for flexibility and access.

### Consider Your Goals:
- Assess your timeline for each financial goal, risk tolerance, and how you want to balance growth vs. stability.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights based on your specific situation.
