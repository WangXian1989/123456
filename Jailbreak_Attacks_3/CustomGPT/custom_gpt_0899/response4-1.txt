Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and when you plan to access the funds. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions (401(k))**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts (IRA and 401(k))**:
   - Contribute to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) and your 401(k) up to their contribution limits, as these accounts offer tax advantages that can help grow your savings more effectively.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - A Traditional IRA or 401(k) allows you to defer taxes on your contributions, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon withdrawal.
   - A Roth IRA allows your investments to grow tax-free, which is advantageous if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Invest any additional funds in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility and access to your money without penalties prior to retirement age.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are well-diversified. This might mean holding different asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each type of account based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Financial situations change, so review your contributions and allocations periodically. Adjust based on changes in income, financial goals, or market conditions.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.

This balanced approach allows you to take advantage of tax benefits while ensuring that you have accessible funds when needed.
