Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. It's effectively free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are owed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Consider this if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings from these accounts are taxed annually on interest, dividends, and capital gains. These are less tax-advantaged but offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for long-term growth without immediate tax hits. Aim to maximize contributions to these accounts.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Funds needed in the near term should be in a taxable account for easier access without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) is balanced across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Contribution Limits and Rules**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type and any specific rules, such as income limits for Roth IRAs.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, including assessing your risk tolerance, investment preferences, and long-term financial goals.
