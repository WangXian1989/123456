The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it's essentially free money. If possible, aim to max out your contributions (for 2024, the limit is $23,000, or $30,500 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). For 2024, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 for those 50 and older). A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA can offer tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA might be beneficial because you'd pay taxes on contributions now rather than later. 
   - Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing tax-deferred accounts (like a Traditional IRA and 401(k)) could save you money in the long run.

### 3. **Investment Diversification:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for tax-efficient investments (like bonds, which can create taxable income). Place stocks in taxable accounts, as they benefit from long-term capital gains rates.
   - Ensure a balanced mix of equities and bonds across all accounts to match your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs and Flexibility:**
   - Keep some savings in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs, as money in 401(k) and IRAs usually incurs penalties for early withdrawal.
   - Assess your timeline for retirement and any major life events (such as buying a house) that may require liquid assets.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance, goals, and any changes in your life circumstances.

### Conclusion:
Creating a tailored plan that takes into account your current situation and future goals is critical. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on detailed assessments of your financial landscape.
