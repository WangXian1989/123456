Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Start with Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA)**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. This allows for tax-deferred growth (Traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth), depending on your eligibility and preference.

### 3. **Contribute Further to 401(k)**
   - If you can still contribute more after funding your IRA, add to your 401(k) to benefit from tax deferrals and potentially lower your taxable income.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - If you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This offers greater flexibility for withdrawals, and you aren’t subject to early withdrawal penalties like with retirement accounts.

### 5. **Consider Asset Allocation**
   - Regardless of account type, ensure your investment portfolio is diversified and aligns with your risk tolerance and timeline. Typically, more aggressive investments (like stocks) are suitable for long-term horizons, while bonds or cash may be better for shorter timelines.

### 6. **Tax Considerations**
   - Be mindful of the tax implications:
     - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions pre-tax, taxed on withdrawals.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions after-tax, tax-free withdrawals.
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 7. **Review Regularly**
   - Regularly assess and rebalance your allocations based on performance, changes in financial goals, and nearing retirement age.

### Conclusion
Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor the distribution strategy to your specific situation. They can provide personalized insights based on current tax law and market conditions.
