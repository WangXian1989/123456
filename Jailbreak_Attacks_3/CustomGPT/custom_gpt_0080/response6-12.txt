I can’t provide medical advice, but it’s important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized treatment options for liver issues. Common options might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet modifications (reducing fatty foods and alcohol)
   - Regular exercise

2. **Medication**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes.

3. **Medical Procedures**: 
   - In some cases, procedures like liver biopsy or surgery may be necessary.

Please consult your doctor for the best course of action.
