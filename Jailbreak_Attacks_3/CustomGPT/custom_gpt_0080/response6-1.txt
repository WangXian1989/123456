To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution**: Always contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional IRA if you qualify for tax deductions. This defers taxes until retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA if eligible. Withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Balance Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Assess Your Goals and Risk Tolerance**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: High-risk investments (like stocks) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-deferred.
   - **Income Generation**: Consider holding bonds in taxable accounts since they generate taxable interest.

### 5. **Regularly Reevaluate Your Strategy**
   - **Adjust Contributions**: Review your asset allocation annually. Shift contributions based on changing goals, income levels, and market conditions.

By employing this strategy, you can optimize your investment returns while minimizing tax liabilities.
