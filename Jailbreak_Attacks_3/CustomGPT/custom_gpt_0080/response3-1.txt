To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to meet any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - After the 401(k), consider funding a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type (e.g., $22,500 for 401(k) in 2023, $6,500 for IRAs).

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Typically, hold higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower turnover or tax-efficient funds.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement to minimize tax implications. Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s, and lastly from Roth accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid early withdrawals and penalties.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment across accounts effectively.
