Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider for optimal allocation:

### 1. Understand Account Types:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with tax benefits. Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing current taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account that can be either Traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (contributions made with after-tax dollars).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts that are subject to capital gains taxes when investments are sold.

### 2. Maximize Contributions:
   - Aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.
   - Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. If eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. Consider Tax Implications:
   - **Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) & Traditional IRA)**: Good for individuals expecting to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Beneficial if you anticipate being in the same or a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for flexible access to funds before retirement age and can be a good home for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 4. Diversification of Investments:
   - Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and market outlook across all accounts.
   - Consider placing more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where interest income is taxed at ordinary income rates.

### 5. Regular Review and Rebalancing:
   - Regularly review your investment allocations and make adjustments as needed to stay aligned with your goals and market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions up to employer match, then contribute to an IRA.
- **IRA**: If you can, fully fund a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Account**: Use this for investments that provide liquidity or if you have additional funds after maxing out retirement accounts.

### Final Thoughts:
Your specific situation may differ, so it's wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your individual circumstances and goals.
