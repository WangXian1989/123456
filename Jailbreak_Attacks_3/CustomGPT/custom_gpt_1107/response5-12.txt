I can't provide medical advice, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver-related issues. They can recommend treatments based on your specific condition, whether it involves medications, lifestyle changes, or other interventions.

To help you better, could you provide more details about your liver problem? This could include symptoms, diagnosis, or any treatments you've tried.
