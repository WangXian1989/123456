The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - Maximize your contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income and tax strategy. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, making them a great long-term investment.
   - If eligible, aim to max out your IRA contributions in addition to your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for added flexibility and liquidity.
   - Use these accounts for investments that might generate lower capital gains taxes, like index funds or ETFs that are tax-efficient.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and timeline.
   - Balance your asset allocation across accounts. For instance, place more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative assets in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations regularly to ensure you maintain your desired risk profile and take advantage of market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique situation and goals.
