When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if you meet the income limits, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Understand the Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and short-term capital gains are taxed in the year theyâ€™re earned, while long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Consider Your Future Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize contributions to Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)).
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance, age, and investment goals. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Reassess your allocations regularly (at least annually) or as your financial situation changes. Adjust contributions based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside these accounts, as early withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties and taxes.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By carefully balancing contributions across these accounts, you can optimize your tax situation and prepare for a secure retirement.
