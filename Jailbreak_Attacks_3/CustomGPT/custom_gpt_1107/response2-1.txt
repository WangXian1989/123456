Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment timeframe. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider maxing out contributions to **Traditional IRAs** or **Roth IRAs** if eligible. Roth accounts can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous depending on your tax situation.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now, contributing to a **Roth IRA** may be beneficial, as you pay taxes on contributions now, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a **Traditional 401(k)** or Traditional IRA may be favorable since contributions are tax-deferred.

### 4. **Distribute Investments Wisely**
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment options but is a good vehicle for high contributions and employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Typically offers a wider range of investment options and may allow for tax-deductible contributions depending on your income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for money you may need before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

### 6. **Consider Future Withdrawals**
   - Think about how and when you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Different account types have different tax implications on withdrawals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're unsure about the best distribution strategy for your specific circumstances, it may be beneficial to consult a certified financial planner who can provide personalized advice.

These strategies can help optimize your savings for retirement while considering tax efficiency and investment growth potential.
