To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your Traditional or Roth IRA contributions for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Traditional 401(k) or IRA:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing current taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are post-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest and dividends are taxed in the year they are earned. Utilize tax-efficient investments here.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Consider different investment vehicles based on their characteristics (e.g., bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid annual taxation on interest).

### 4. **Longevity of Investments**
   - Use taxable accounts for funds that you might need before retirement; longer-term investments are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts where growth isnâ€™t taxed annually.

### Summary
- Start with contributions to capture employer matches.
- Prioritize maxing out IRAs for tax benefits.
- Maintain diverse, tax-efficient investments based on your financial goals and timelines.

Ultimately, regularly review your allocations and adjust based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.
