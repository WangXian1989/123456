The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your current financial situation, tax considerations, and retirement goals. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer-Matched Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The ability to deduct contributions to a Traditional IRA or enjoy tax-free withdrawals from a Roth IRA can be advantageous.

3. **Continue Contributing to the 401(k)**: After you've hit the employer match and IRA contribution limits, consider contributing more to your 401(k) up to the federal contribution limit if it offers good investment options.

4. **Fund Taxable Accounts**: Wealth in taxable accounts can provide liquidity and flexibility. Funds here can be used as an emergency fund or for short-term goals, and you won't face penalties for withdrawal.

5. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**: Depending on your income level and projected retirement tax bracket, the balance between tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) versus taxable accounts may vary. 

6. **Consider Your Risk Tolerance**: All investments come with risks, and balancing your allocation according to how much risk you're comfortable with is essential. You may want to optimize your 401(k) and IRAs with more aggressive investments while keeping less volatile options in taxable accounts for flexibility.

7. **Review Annually**: Finally, it’s important to reevaluate your distribution strategy annually or when significant life changes occur, like a new job or a change in financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that takes into account your unique situation and financial goals.
