To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

2. **Analyze Your Tax Situation**:
   - Consider your current and projected future tax bracket. Taxable accounts can be beneficial for high earners who expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income (e.g., long-term capital gains).

3. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Be aware of asset location: place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts while holding lower-growth assets in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

4. **Regularly Rebalance**:
   - Re-evaluate your asset allocation periodically and adjust contributions if necessary to stay aligned with your long-term investment goals.

Following these guidelines can help you effectively manage your investment distributions and enhance your portfolio's overall performance.
