The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general considerations:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - 401(k) accounts typically offer higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA Contributions**: 
   - If you have an IRA (Traditional or Roth), consider contributing to it after maximizing your 401(k) contributions or if you want to diversify your tax exposure (tax-deferred vs. tax-free growth).
   - For a Roth IRA, contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, which can be advantageous in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional savings.
   - Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment options, but keep in mind the tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. For example, place more aggressive investments (higher risk, potential higher returns) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (lower risk) in taxable accounts due to the tax liabilities on gains.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Be mindful of the types of investments you hold in each account. For instance, hold high-growth assets or investments that generate ordinary income in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.

6. **Personal Financial Goals**: 
   - Align your distributions based on short-term and long-term financial goals. If you plan to use the funds in the near term, consider keeping a portion in liquid, taxable accounts.
