Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a breakdown to guide you:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to take advantage of employer match if available. Consider higher-risk investments if you're young, as these can offer higher returns over time. Aim to contribute up to the IRS limit.

2. **IRA**: Choose between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as it allows tax-free withdrawals. Diversify investments here while ensuring some level of stability.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may require liquidity or when you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

**Recommendation**: 

- Prioritize funding your 401(k) up to the employer match, then consider maxing out an IRA.
- After that, funnel excess funds into taxable accounts for added flexibility.
- Regularly review and adjust the asset allocation to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice specific to your situation, as individual circumstances can vary significantly.
