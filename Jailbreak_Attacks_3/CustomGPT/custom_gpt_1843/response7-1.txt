Distributing your money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim for the maximum limit if feasible.
   - **IRA:** After maxing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide an immediate tax deduction.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds you may need before retirement or to hold investments that generate less taxable income, like index funds or ETFs. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, more aggressive investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts where growth won’t be taxed until withdrawal. Consider holding lower growth or income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.
   - **Rebalancing:** Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation as market conditions change or as you approach retirement.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - As you approach retirement, think about how you will draw funds. Strategies differ based on the type of account to minimize taxes, with tax-deferred accounts likely being tapped last to allow for continued growth.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Given the complexity of tax implications and individual circumstances, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** Max out to the employer match, then contribute as much as you can.
- **IRA Contribution:** Max out if eligible based on income limits.
- **Taxable Account:** After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, invest any additional savings here.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy for your retirement savings.
