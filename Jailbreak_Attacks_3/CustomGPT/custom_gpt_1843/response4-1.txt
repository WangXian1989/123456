Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to help you:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions (before tax), while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (after tax). Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - 401(k) plans typically have limited investment options. Focus on low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - For IRAs, you may have more flexibility. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.
   - Taxable accounts are less restricted; be mindful of capital gains taxes when buying and selling assets.

5. **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize investments for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA). Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments or those you may need to access sooner.

6. **Asset Location Strategy**: Consider the types of investments in each account type. For example, place high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact on dividends and interest.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Your asset allocation should adapt to market changes and your evolving financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial planner.

Adjust these strategies based on your individual circumstances, including your age, income, retirement goals, and risk tolerance.
