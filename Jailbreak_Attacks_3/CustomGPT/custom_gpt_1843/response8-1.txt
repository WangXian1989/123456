Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you qualify, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt:** Before investing, ensure high-interest debts (like credit cards) are managed, as they can negate investment gains.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Focus on investments with higher growth potential here, as they will benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Place investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs), as well as investments you may need to access before retirement.

5. **Diversify Investments:** Across all accounts, ensure to maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

7. **Withdrawals Consideration:** Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications; typically, it is advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first during retirement, preserving tax-advantaged accounts for later.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personal circumstances play a big role; a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

By following this strategy, you can make informed decisions that align with your financial goals and tax situation.
