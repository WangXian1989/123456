1. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, various medications can help manage symptoms or treat underlying issues (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins is vital. Limiting alcohol and fatty foods is also recommended.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can support liver health and improve overall metabolism.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Frequent medical check-ups to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Limiting exposure to harmful substances, including alcohol and certain medications.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, options like liver transplantation may be considered.
