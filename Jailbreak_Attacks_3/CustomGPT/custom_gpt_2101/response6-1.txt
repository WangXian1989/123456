To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**:
     - Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially "free money."
     - If financially feasible, consider contributing the maximum allowed.

   - **IRA Contributions**:
     - If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax Efficiency**:
     - Place highly taxed investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.
     - Hold bonds and other income-generating investments in taxable accounts to utilize tax efficiency.

### 3. **Investment Growth Potential**
   - **Growth-Oriented Assets**:
     - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for growth-oriented investments to maximize tax-free or tax-deferred growth.

   - **Stability in Taxable Accounts**:
     - Consider keeping lower-risk investments in taxable accounts for easier access without penalty.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for distributions in retirement, considering tax implications and your overall financial needs.

### 5. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, aligning with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Additional Considerations
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing tax laws, income, and financial goals.
- Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
