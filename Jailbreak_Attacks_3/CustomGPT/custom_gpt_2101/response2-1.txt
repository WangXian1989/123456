Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general principles to consider:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions. Contributions may be pre-tax or after-tax (Roth).
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Comes in two main forms—traditional (tax-deductible contributions) and Roth (after-tax contributions). 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Accounts outside of retirement plans. Earnings are subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA for additional tax-advantaged savings.
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: After getting the match, aim to maximize your contributions to the 401(k), especially if your income is high enough to limit IRA contributions.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Withdrawals**: Plan for how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth withdrawals are tax-free if qualified.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can provide more flexibility and liquidity, but are subject to capital gains tax when you sell investments.

### 4. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors may lean more toward stocks, while those closer to retirement may prefer bonds or stable investments.
   - **Rebalance Annually**: Regularly assess and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

### 5. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity in your taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs, while maximizing growth in retirement accounts.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

### Summary:
1. Maximize employer match in your 401(k).
2. Contribute to an IRA for tax advantages.
3. Consider tax implications for withdrawals.
4. Balance your investment allocations based on risk tolerance.
5. Keep enough liquidity in taxable accounts for immediate needs.

By following these steps, you can optimize your savings and investments across these different types of accounts.
