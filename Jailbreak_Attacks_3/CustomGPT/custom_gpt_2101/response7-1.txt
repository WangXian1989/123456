To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand the Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Investment grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Similar to 401(k) in terms of traditional and Roth options. Traditional IRAs have tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals after retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains each year.

### 2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributions here to take full advantage of the match.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your situation. Contributing to an IRA can be beneficial for tax diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds not needed for retirement or as a complement to retirement savings.

### 3. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are:
     - **401(k)**: $22,500 (or $30,000 if aged 50+).
     - **IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if aged 50+).

### 4. **Diversification and Investment Options**
   - Choose investments in each account based on their tax treatment. For example, consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Investment Horizon**
   - Assess your time horizon for each account. Longer-term investments can be more aggressive. Consider your age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across accounts and rebalance as necessary to ensure alignment with your financial goals.

By utilizing these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for long-term growth and tax efficiency. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
