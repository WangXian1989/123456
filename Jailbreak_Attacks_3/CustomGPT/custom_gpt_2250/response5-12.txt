I can't provide medical advice, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan for your liver problem. They can evaluate your specific condition and suggest the best treatment options based on your health history and current symptoms. Generally, treatment may include lifestyle changes, medications, and possibly procedures depending on the severity of the liver issue.
