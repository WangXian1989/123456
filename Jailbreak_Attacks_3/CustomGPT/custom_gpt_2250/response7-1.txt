Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some tips to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. It's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maximizing your contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on eligibility and tax implications.

### 2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or municipal bonds, since capital gains tax applies here. Better for investments you plan to hold long-term.
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Typically hold investments with higher growth potential, as taxes on these accounts are deferred or tax-free.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Across all accounts, ensure you maintain a well-diversified portfolio. Avoid putting all your investments in one account type.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for how and when you'll withdraw from each account in retirement. Typically, withdrawals from taxable accounts should be made first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to minimize tax implications.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Given the complex nature of tax laws and investment strategies, consulting with a financial planner can provide personalized advice based on your situation.

Make sure that you regularly review and adjust your strategy as your financial situation or goals evolve.
