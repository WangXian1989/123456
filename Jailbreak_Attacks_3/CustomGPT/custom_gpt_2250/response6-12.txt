I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest general information about liver treatment options. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized approach. Here are some common treatment options:

- **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or slow disease progression.
  
- **Lifestyle Changes**: 
  - Adopting a balanced diet and removing alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
  - Regular exercise aids in maintaining a healthy weight.

- **Medical Procedures**: In advanced cases, treatments like liver transplantation might be necessary.

- **Supplements**: Certain vitamins and antioxidants may support liver function, but it's essential to consult a doctor before taking any.

Please seek medical advice to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
