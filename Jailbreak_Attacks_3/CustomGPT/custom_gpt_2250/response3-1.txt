Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer match contributions; pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages, with traditional IRAs being tax-deferred and Roth IRAs allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but offers flexibility for withdrawals and can be used for short-term goals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Always aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
   - **Debt Considerations**: Pay down high-interest debt before over-contributing to retirement accounts.

### 3. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - If eligible, maximize contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - Consider a traditional IRA if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - For short-term needs (1-5 years), focus on the taxable account for flexibility.

### 5. **Tax Planning**:
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts.
   - Withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts in retirement can significantly affect your tax bracket.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out to the employer match initially.
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the maximum limit if possible.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for any surplus funds after maxing out retirement accounts or for savings goals.

### Conclusion:
Balance your contributions based on your current financial situation, goals, and tax implications, adjusting as needed over time. Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy suited to your circumstances.
