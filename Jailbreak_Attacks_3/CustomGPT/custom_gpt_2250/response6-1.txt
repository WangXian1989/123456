To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

### Tax Efficiency
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to reduce taxable income. Focus on maxing out annual limits if possible.
- **Choosing Investments Wisely**: Place high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and interest.

### Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match right away. After that, determine how much more to add based on your overall investment strategy.
- **IRA**: Consider using a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later. Traditional IRAs can be beneficial if you're currently in a higher tax bracket.

### Diversification
- **Asset Mix Consideration**: Diversify your investments across all accounts, but avoid over-concentration. Ensure a balanced allocation that reflects your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
  
By implementing these strategies, you can build a robust financial plan that maximizes your returns while minimizing taxes effectively.
