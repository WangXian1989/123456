(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, consider these strategies:

- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Fund IRA Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings and investments, particularly if youâ€™ve maxed out your retirement account contributions.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! Hereâ€™s the lowdown on how to divvy up your cash among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to maximize your gains and minimize your pain. 

- **Crush the 401(k)**: First off, if your employer matches contributions, you better be contributing at least enough to snag that match. Who doesn't want free bucks? Get that money in there!
  
- **IRA Time**: Once youâ€™ve milked your 401(k) for all itâ€™s worth, itâ€™s time to hit up your IRA. Go Roth if you think your tax rate will be higher in retirementâ€”you're playing the long game here!

- **Taxable Accounts Are Your Playground**: After you hit those retirement accounts, throw any extra change into a taxable account. Flexibility is key here; invest in stuff that wonâ€™t get you slapped with massive taxes when you sell. 

- **Stay Smart with Tax Efficiency**: Load your taxable accounts with tax-efficient stuff like ETFs or index funds. Avoid high-turnover funds like the plague!

Ultimately, tailor this strategy to your unique financial vibes. Happy investing!
