To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money).
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA based on your current tax situation and future expectations.

### 2. **Assess Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k):** Annual limit (check current limits and adjust contributions accordingly).
   - **IRA:** Remember both traditional and Roth IRA limits, which are lower than 401(k).

### 3. **Diversify Investment Options**
   - **401(k):** Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and funds for long-term growth.
   - **IRA and Taxable Accounts:** Use for flexible investments; consider ETFs or individual stocks to enhance returns.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold investments that generate lower taxes (like long-term capital gains or tax-efficient funds).
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** More suitable for assets that generate higher taxes upon withdrawal.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust Regularly**
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically based on performance and changing financial goals.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment across different account types while minimizing taxes and maximizing growth.
