I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options for liver problems can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to improve liver function.

2. **Medication**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation.

3. **Procedures**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: For severe liver failure.
   - **Endoscopic Procedures**: To treat complications like varices.

Make sure to discuss these options with your doctor to find the best path forward for your specific condition.
