Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA, particularly if you can benefit from tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for goals with shorter time frames or once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility and liquidity.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider using tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes and keep dividend-producing investments in taxable accounts for favorable tax treatment.
