To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (usually a 50% match on your first 6%).
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income levels and tax strategy.

2. **Balance Liquidity and Growth:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for shorter-term goals and investments that may generate capital gains, which can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on equities in retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) due to their tax-deferred growth potential.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Allocate higher-risk assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where growth is tax-deferred.
   - Place lower-risk assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts for better tax efficiency, as they'll generate manageable taxable income.

4. **Review & Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation to align with your risk tolerance and retirement goals. Rebalance as necessary to maintain your target allocation.

5. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline:**
   - For early retirement or anticipated withdrawals, prioritize liquidity in taxable accounts to avoid penalties on early withdrawals from retirement accounts.
