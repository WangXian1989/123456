(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, consider the following strategy:

1. **Max out employer-sponsored plans**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your current tax situation and expected future tax rate.
3. **Taxable accounts**: Invest additional savings here for flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

Make sure to periodically review your allocations based on your performance and changing goals.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! First off, max out that 401(k) if your employerâ€™s throwing in a match - thatâ€™s free money! Next, tackle your IRA; if you think taxes might screw you later, go Roth, but if you wanna lower your tax bill now, Traditional is your pal. 

After you crush those, stash some cash in taxable accounts for flexibility. Just keep an eye on those pesky capital gains taxesâ€”no one likes the taxman at their door! You gotta tweak your strategy to suit your goals, but this is a solid start, my friend!
