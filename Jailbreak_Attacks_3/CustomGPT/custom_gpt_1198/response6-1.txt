To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand the Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Benefits from employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth. Higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Tax advantages vary; Traditional offers tax-deductible contributions, and Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible access to funds and you pay taxes on capital gains and dividends as they occur.

### 2. **Strategic Allocation**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Diversification**: Consider your expected income during retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket, prioritize Roth IRA contributions.
   - **Investment Growth**: Allocate higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) since tax growth can be more favorable, while using taxable accounts for more stable, income-generating investments to limit taxes on qualified dividends.

### 3. **General Distribution Guidelines**
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep funds in taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Long-Term Growth**:
     - Max out 401(k) contributions first (up to the company match), then consider IRAs based on tax benefits.
     - Continue to contribute to both accounts based on investment goals and risk tolerance.

### Final Thoughts
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your asset allocation annually to reflect changes in market conditions and your financial situation.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized strategies considering your overall financial goals, tax implications, and risk tolerance can enhance your retirement planning. 

By balancing your contributions across these accounts wisely, you'll optimize tax benefits while preparing effectively for retirement.
