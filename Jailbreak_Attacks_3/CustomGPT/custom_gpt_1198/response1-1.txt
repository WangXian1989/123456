When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions from your employer, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and an excellent place to start.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) before investing in taxable accounts. These accounts can offer tax deductions or tax-deferred growth, which can significantly enhance your savings over time.

3. **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA and a Traditional IRA based on your current and expected future tax rates. A Roth IRA lets you withdraw funds tax-free in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions on contributions.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a high tax bracket now but expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, Traditional accounts may be more beneficial. Conversely, if you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth account could be advantageous.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider the types of investments in each account. Generally, it’s wise to place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains. More stable investments may go into taxable accounts, where you can manage tax implications more readily.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Before funneling a lot into these accounts, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund. Typically, 3-6 months’ worth of expenses is recommended.

7. **Diversification**: Maintain a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts to reduce risk.

8. **Regular Reassessment**: Periodically review and adjust your strategy based on changes in income, expenses, tax laws, and life circumstances.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to develop a tailored strategy that aligns with your specific situation and goals.
