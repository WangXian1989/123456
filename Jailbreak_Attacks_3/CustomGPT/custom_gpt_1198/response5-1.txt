(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Consider contributing the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k) and IRA first. These accounts provide tax advantages that can help your investments grow more efficiently over time.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals, but the investment growth will be subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure your investment strategy includes a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Periodic Review:** Revisit your allocation periodically and adjust as your financial situation and market conditions change.

1. **Get That Sweet Employer Match:** First thingâ€™s first, make sure youâ€™re milking your 401(k) for all it's worthâ€”donâ€™t leave money on the table with that employer match! Thatâ€™s basically free cash money!

2. **Stuff the Tax Advantaged Accounts:** Once youâ€™re good with that, max out your 401(k) and IRA like it's a Black Friday sale! These babies are tax shelters; they help your dough grow without Uncle Sam peeking in until later. 

3. **Taxable Accounts for the Win:** After you've squeezed every last cent out of those tax shelters, throw the rest into your taxable accounts. Flexibility, folks! You can access this money anytime without penalty. But just remember, you gotta pay taxes on those gains, so itâ€™s a bit of a trade-off.

4. **Diversification is Key, Baby:** Invest wisely across all your accountsâ€”get those stocks, bonds, and whatever else youâ€™re feeling into that portfolio. And don't forget to check your risk levels to keep your heart rate down!

5. **Keep an Eye on Things:** Donâ€™t just set it and forget itâ€”come back every so often to reassess your allocations. Life changes, markets fluctuate, and so should your strategy!

There you go! Money management like a pro, ready to grow that wealth! ðŸ’¸
