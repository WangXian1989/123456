There isn't a one-size-fits-all answer for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, as the optimal strategy depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. However, here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth 401(k)s), which can lower your taxable income in the contribution year.
   - Consider the fees and investment options in your 401(k) compared to other accounts.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Depending on your current and expected future tax rates, this could be beneficial.
   - A Traditional IRA may give you a tax deduction now, but distributions in retirement will be taxed at your income tax rate.
   - IRAs often have more diverse investment options than many 401(k) plans.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility; you can withdraw anytime without penalty (though taxes on gains may apply).
   - These accounts are great for short-to-medium-term goals since they offer liquidity.
   - Be aware of capital gains taxes and how they can affect your returns over time. 

### Suggested Strategy
- Start by maximizing the employer match in your 401(k).
- Next, contribute to an IRA (preferably Roth if you qualify).
- Finally, allocate any remaining funds to your taxable accounts, especially if you have short-term goals.

### Periodic Reassessment
Every year or when your financial situation changes, reassess your strategy. Consider tax implications, market conditions, and how close you are to retirement.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific needs.
