The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide an immediate tax deduction.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: After maximizing the employer match and contributing to an IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. This allows for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can consider putting additional money into taxable investment accounts. Here, you can select investments that might yield favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains or tax-efficient funds.

5. **Asset Allocation Considerations**: 
   - Generally, you may want to hold more tax-inefficient assets (like bonds and REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) where dividends and interest are taxed at a higher rate.
   - Keep more tax-efficient assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts, since long-term capital gains tax rates may be lower.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in tax laws, your income, and retirement goals. 

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Remember, individual circumstances can vary widely, so it's essential to consider your financial situation comprehensively.
