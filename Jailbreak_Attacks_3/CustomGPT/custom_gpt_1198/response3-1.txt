The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantage Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (unless it's a Roth 401(k)), reducing your taxable income for the year. Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, you can contribute to a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. Consider maxing out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) match.
  
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts are more flexible and do not have the same restrictions as retirement accounts, but be mindful of the tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Your current and expected future tax brackets can influence your decision:
   - If you are in a higher tax bracket now, favor tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA).
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth accounts.

5. **Investment Timeline**: For longer-term goals (like retirement), you can take advantage of the growth potential in tax-deferred accounts. Shorter-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts due to their liquidity.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in income, expenses, tax laws, and investment performance.

It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for a tailored plan that suits your specific circumstances.
