The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on several factors including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions for contributions depending on your income level.

3. **Prioritize Tax Benefits:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so you won't owe taxes when you withdraw in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts do not provide the same tax benefits but offer flexibility in accessing funds without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Consider Investment Options and Fees:** Evaluate the investment options and fees associated with each account type. Some 401(k) plans may have limited or expensive options, whereas IRAs often provide a broader range of investment choices.

5. **Maintain a Balanced Portfolio:** Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified and align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. This may mean holding different asset allocations in each account type based on liquidity, tax implications, and your financial goals.

6. **Tax-Loss Harvesting in Taxable Accounts:** In taxable accounts, consider using tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains with losses, potentially lowering your tax bill.

7. **Adjust Contributions Over Time:** As your income increases or your financial goals change, you may want to adjust how much you contribute to each account type. Regularly review your contributions and investment strategy at least annually.

Itâ€™s often advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that fits your unique situation. They can help you navigate the complexities of tax implications, retirement goals, and investment strategies.
