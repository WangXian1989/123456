Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer-Sponsored Retirement Accounts (401(k))**:
   - If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to start.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Look into opening a Traditional or Roth IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it for potential tax-free growth. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions in the year of contribution.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in a taxable account. These accounts provide flexibility since you can access your funds without penalties.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Understand the tax implications of each account type:
     - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, and you pay taxes upon withdrawal.
     - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals if criteria are met.
     - **Taxable**: Capital gains will be taxed when you sell investments, but you can offset gains with losses.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Regardless of where you invest, maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund separate from your retirement accounts.

7. **Regular Review and Adjustments**:
   - Reassess your allocations annually or after major life changes to ensure they align with your goals.
