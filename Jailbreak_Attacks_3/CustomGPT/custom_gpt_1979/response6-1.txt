To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following actionable points:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for pre-tax contributions. 

2. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains taxes, such as index funds or tax-efficient funds. This allows for more liquidity and flexibility for future needs.

3. **Assess Your Financial Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Short-term needs should lean more toward taxable accounts for easy access.
   - Long-term growth can be prioritised in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from compounding.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Consider asset location strategy: hold high-yield, more volatile investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts to reduce tax liability.

5. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Keep track of your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.

With these strategies, you can effectively grow your wealth while minimizing tax burdens. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
