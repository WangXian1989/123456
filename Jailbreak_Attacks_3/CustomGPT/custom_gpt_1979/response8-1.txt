The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If you can, consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After fully funding your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to its maximum limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any additional savings can go into taxable investment accounts. These provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawal and investment choices, but be mindful of capital gains tax.

5. **Diversify Investments**: In each account, diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets. Keep your risk tolerance in mind, as well as your investment timeline.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Different accounts have various tax implications. For example, withdrawals from a taxable account may result in capital gains taxes, while withdrawals from a Traditional 401(k) and IRA will be taxed as ordinary income.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changing life circumstances.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your personal financial situation.

Ultimately, a well-balanced approach that aligns with your long-term financial goals will serve you best.
