1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Healthy diet (low in fat, high in fiber)
   - Regular exercise
   - Avoiding alcohol and drugs

2. **Medications**:
   - Antiviral treatments (for hepatitis)
   - Corticosteroids (for autoimmune liver diseases)
   - Supplements (such as Vitamin E for fatty liver disease)

3. **Procedures**:
   - If liver function is severely affected, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests and imaging to monitor liver health.

Always seek a tailored approach from your doctor for the best outcome.
