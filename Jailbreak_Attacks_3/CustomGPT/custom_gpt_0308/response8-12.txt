I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopt a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and avoid alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), medications may help manage symptoms.
3. **Supplements**: Some people find benefits from specific vitamins and supplements, but consult a doctor first.
4. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or even liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
