1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopt a healthy diet low in fat and sugar.
   - Maintain a healthy weight through exercise.
   - Avoid alcohol and limit medications that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging tests to assess liver health.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.
