To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, balancing your overall tax liability.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on high-growth investments in your 401(k) and IRA to defer taxes until withdrawal.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset mix based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - **Rebalance Annually**: Review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain desired asset allocation.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for how and when you'll withdraw funds, considering tax implications and required minimum distributions (RMDs) for 401(k) and traditional IRA accounts starting at age 73.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure diversification across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk.

### Suggested Contribution Order:
1. **401(k)**: Max employer match â†’ Max out contributions.
2. **IRA**: Contribute to either traditional or Roth based on your financial situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest additional funds after utilizing tax-advantaged options.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid assets for emergencies.
- **Long-Term Goals**: Align contributions with retirement dates and lifestyle goals.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investments, minimize taxes, and work toward your financial goals effectively.
