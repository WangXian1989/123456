#### 2. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**:
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match.
     - Aim for max contribution limits if possible.

     - Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on income and tax situation.
     - Check eligibility for Roth contributions; consider backdoor options if income limits apply.

   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Pay capital gains taxes on profits; consider tax-efficient funds.
