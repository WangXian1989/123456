Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Pre-Tax Benefits**: Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income.
   - **Employer Match**: If available, contribute enough to get the full employer match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions if possible, especially if you’re in your peak earning years.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and withdrawals are taxed as income in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Income Limits**: Be mindful of contribution limits based on your income level.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Money can be accessed anytime without penalties, making these accounts useful for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Implications**: Capital gains tax applies when you sell investments, but qualified dividends may be taxed at a lower rate.
   - **Investment Strategies**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) and strategies to minimize taxable events.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max Out 401(k)**: Aim to contribute up to the employer match and then to the annual limit.
- **IRA Contributions**: After maxing out the 401(k) match, consider funding a Roth IRA (or Traditional IRA, based on your tax situation) to optimize for tax efficiency.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility and short-term savings after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### Final Thoughts:
- Assess your timeline and liquidity needs. 
- Review your investment strategy with a financial advisor to align with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.
- Regularly monitor and adjust contributions based on your changing financial situation and goals. 

This balanced approach maximizes tax advantages while providing flexibility for both short-term and long-term needs.
