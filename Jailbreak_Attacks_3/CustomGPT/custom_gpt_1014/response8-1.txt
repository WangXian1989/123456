To optimize your investment strategy among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: This is a tax-deferred account where contributions reduce your taxable income. It's beneficial to hold higher-growth investments here since you won't pay taxes on capital gains until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal. Useful for those who expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is ideal for those who expect to be in the same or a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Since capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they are realized, these accounts are best for holding lower-growth investments or those with tax advantages, such as municipal bonds.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance and goals across all accounts. Avoid holding the same investment in multiple accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a more liquid account.

6. **Consider Fees**: Be mindful of any fees associated with your accounts. Aim for low-cost investment options.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, think about the order in which you will draw from these accounts, as this can influence your tax liabilities.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your specific financial situation and goals.
