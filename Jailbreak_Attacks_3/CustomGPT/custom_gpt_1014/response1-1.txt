Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Good for high contribution limits and potential employer matching.
   - **IRA or Roth IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing in taxable accounts. Aim for 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've filled your tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. These can provide more liquidity but may incur taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments within each account. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investments and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.

Always keep in mind your long-term financial goals and risk tolerance when making decisions.
