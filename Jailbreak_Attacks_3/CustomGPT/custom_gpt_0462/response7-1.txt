Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal in retirement. In contrast, Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts do not provide any tax advantages but offer more flexibility.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Depending on your age and retirement timeline, you might want to adjust your asset allocation. Younger investors might focus more on growth (investing in stocks), while those closer to retirement might prefer a more conservative approach (bonds or cash).

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that you are diversifying your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, the value of your investments will change, so itâ€™s important to periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation and goals.
