I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on treatment options for liver problems. Itâ€™s important to consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: These may include a healthy diet, regular exercise, and weight management. Reducing alcohol intake is crucial for those with liver issues.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), medications such as antivirals, corticosteroids, or other drugs may be prescribed.

3. **Nutritional Support**: In some cases, nutritional supplements or specific diets may be recommended to support liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function and disease progression can be essential.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases (like liver failure or certain tumors), liver transplantation may be considered.

6. **Avoiding Toxins**: Avoid exposure to harmful substances that can affect the liver, such as certain medications, chemicals, and drugs.

Remember to discuss any symptoms or concerns with a healthcare provider to get the most appropriate treatment tailored to your situation.
