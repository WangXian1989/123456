To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money. Max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider funding your IRA next. Whether to choose a Traditional or Roth IRA depends on your income level and tax situation. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments across a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to manage risk. Your risk tolerance and time horizon will impact your allocation.

4. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, it may be wise to focus on paying that down first before maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts.

5. **Tax Implications**: Consider the tax implications of each account type. Withdrawals from a Traditional 401(k) or IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are generally tax-free if certain conditions are met. Taxable accounts will incur capital gains taxes when investments are sold.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment performance and allocation, adjusting as needed based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your personal financial goals and circumstances.
