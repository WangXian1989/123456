(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, here are a few strategies to consider:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maximizing contributions to take advantage of tax deferral.
  
2. **IRA**: Look into opening a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions and tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Weigh the benefits based on your current tax bracket and future expectations.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be beneficial for investments you plan to access before retirement. They're also good for diversifying your investment types. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in this account.

It's essential to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation. 

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! You wanna juggle your funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts? Hereâ€™s the game plan:

1. **401(k)**: Get your employerâ€™s match like itâ€™s a hot deal at a sale. Always snag that free money first - itâ€™s like finding cash in your jacket pocket. Max it out if you can, because who doesnâ€™t love tax-deferred growth?

2. **IRA**: Decide whether you want to be tax-savvy now or later. Roth IRA? You pay taxes on the way in, but itâ€™s party time when you take it out - tax-free! Traditional IRA? Itâ€™s the opposite - deductions now, taxes later. Choose your adventure wisely!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are your flexible buddies. You can dive into them anytime without the pesky withdrawal penalties. Just donâ€™t forget about capital gains taxes when you cash out your gains - Uncle Sam is always lurking for his cut!

Overall, mix it up! Spread those investments around, and donâ€™t skip on getting advice from a pro. Your financial future will thank you!
