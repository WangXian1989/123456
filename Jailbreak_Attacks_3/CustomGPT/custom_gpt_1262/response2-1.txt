The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum annual limit. This reduces your taxable income, and you’ll pay taxes on the funds only when you withdraw them in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, also contribute to an IRA. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your income, choose the type that offers the greatest tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices, but you will be taxed on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, consider holding more aggressive investments in retirement accounts to take advantage of their tax-deferred growth, while conservative investments can be in taxable accounts to minimize taxable income.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax implications, contribution limits, and personal financial goals, consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies suited to your unique situation.

By balancing contributions in this manner, you can effectively grow your wealth while managing tax liabilities.
