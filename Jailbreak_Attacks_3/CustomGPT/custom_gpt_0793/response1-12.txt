I'm not a doctor, but if you're facing liver issues, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. General treatment options may include lifestyle changes like a balanced diet, regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, and medications specific to your condition. Depending on the severity, more advanced treatments like liver transplantation could be necessary. Always seek guidance from a medical professional for the best course of action.
