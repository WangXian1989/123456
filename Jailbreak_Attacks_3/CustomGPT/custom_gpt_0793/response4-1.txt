Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Fill Up 401(k):** If you still have money to invest after your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k), aiming to max out your contribution limit if possible.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can contribute to taxable accounts. This offers flexibility, as you can access funds without penalties before retirement age.

5. **Investment Strategy:** Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider different asset allocations between stocks, bonds, and other securities.

6. **Tax Efficiency:** In taxable accounts, prioritize investments that have favorable tax implications, such as long-term capital gains or investments that pay qualified dividends.

7. **Review Regularly:** Periodically assess your distribution strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and retirement goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
