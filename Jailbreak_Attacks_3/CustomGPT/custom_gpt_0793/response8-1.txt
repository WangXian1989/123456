To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start with your 401(k). Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maxing out the match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your tax situation.

   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Balance Contributions**: If you can, try to balance additional contributions between your 401(k) and IRA, keeping in mind the contribution limits.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've contributed the maximum to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. These offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals and no contribution limits.

5. **Consider Investment Choices**: In tax-advantaged accounts, hold investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) since the tax impact is deferred. In taxable accounts, consider holding stocks for long-term appreciation, as long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly evaluate your investment strategy based on your financial goals, market conditions, and changes in tax laws.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consulting with a financial planner can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

This strategy allows for a balanced approach, maximizing tax benefits while providing the flexibility needed for various financial goals.
