I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet modifications (low-sodium, balanced diet)
   - Weight management 
   - Avoiding alcohol

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or slow disease progression.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Frequent check-ups with blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be considered.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some people explore herbal supplements and alternative treatments, but these should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

Consulting a healthcare professional will give you the best course of action tailored to your specific needs.
