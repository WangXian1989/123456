To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, ensure you contribute enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and future income projections.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These should be funded last. When investing here, prioritize assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates compared to short-term gains.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Keep higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Ensure that your asset allocation remains aligned with your financial goals by regularly reviewing and adjusting your portfolio.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize taxes, taking from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personal circumstances vary, so getting tailored advice can help create a balanced approach based on your specific goals.

By focusing on tax efficiency and maximizing growth potential across different types of accounts, you can create a well-rounded investment strategy.
