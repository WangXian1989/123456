To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Growth**: Prioritize contributions to your IRA (either traditional or Roth) for tax benefits, depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens, like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs, since these can minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Regular Contributions**: Allocate funds regularly (dollar-cost averaging) across all accounts to balance growth and risk.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Adjust contributions based on current and expected future tax brackets, favoring tax-deferred accounts if you expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy Planning**: As you approach retirement, develop a strategy for withdrawing from these accounts tax-efficiently.

Consulting a financial advisor is also a good idea to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
