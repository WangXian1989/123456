Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Start with Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Max out IRA contributions:** If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, focusing on tax benefits.
   - **Continue 401(k) contributions:** After maxing out your IRA, contribute more to your 401(k), especially if it has tax benefits.

### 3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These offer flexibility for withdrawals and are useful for short- to mid-term goals.

### 4. **Consider Your Investment Strategy:**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate income or short-term gains, as these might be taxed at a lower rate.

### 5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Regularly assess your portfolio, adjust allocations based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax impacts.

### Summary:
1. **401(k)** - Maximize employer match and contributions.
2. **IRA** - Aim to max out contributions.
3. **Taxable accounts** - For liquidity and investment flexibility.
