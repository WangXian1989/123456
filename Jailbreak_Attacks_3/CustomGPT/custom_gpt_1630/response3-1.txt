Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **Tax benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **Investment options**: Check available investment choices and fees.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax considerations**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution limits**: Ensure you meet annual contribution limits.
   - **Diversification**: Use a mix of assets tailored to your risk tolerance.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Funds can be accessed anytime without penalties.
   - **Tax implications**: Be aware of capital gains taxes; focus on tax-efficient investments.
   - **Short-term goals**: Suitable for goals within the next 5 years.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Short-term goals**: Keep funds in taxable accounts for easy access.
- **Medium/long-term goals**: Max out 401(k) and then fund an IRA.
- **Consider your tax bracket**: Choose between traditional or Roth accounts based on your current and expected future tax rates.

### Regular Review:
Regularly revisit your allocations to adapt to changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.
