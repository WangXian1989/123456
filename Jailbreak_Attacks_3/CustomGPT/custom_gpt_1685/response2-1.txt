When considering how to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to take into account several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some points to consider for each account type:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: 401(k) plans typically have higher annual contribution limits compared to IRAs, so consider maximizing your 401(k) contributions if you’re still below the limit after getting the match.

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Diversification**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions, taxed on withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals), this can help spread your tax burden in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits and consider contributing to an IRA after maxing out your 401(k) if you have additional funds.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts do not have contribution limits and offer more flexibility for withdrawals. They are beneficial for short to mid-term savings or investment goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be aware of how capital gains are taxed in these accounts and consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting to minimize taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Prioritize the 401(k) for Contributions**: Aim to contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match. Then, consider increasing contributions based on your financial capacity.
2. **Maximize IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement timeframe.
3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Surge in Savings**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, funnel additional savings into a taxable account, especially for goals in the near future (like saving for a home).

### Final Thoughts:
It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can consider your unique circumstances and help in crafting a distribution strategy tailored to your goals. They can assist in analyzing your tax situation, investment risk tolerance, and retirement timeline to optimize your asset allocation across these accounts.
