I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that if you're dealing with liver problems, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice. Treatment options typically depend on the specific liver condition you have. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes such as avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy diet, managing weight, and exercising. In some cases, medications or procedures may be necessary. Always prioritize professional guidance for health-related issues!
