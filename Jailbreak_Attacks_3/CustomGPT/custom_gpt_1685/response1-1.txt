To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first, as it is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match and consider maxing it out if you can, as contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider opening a Traditional or Roth IRA. If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial. If you prefer tax deductions now, a Traditional IRA is a good option.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA(s), consider investing in taxable accounts. This can provide more liquidity and flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account type based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, equities are best suited for long-term growth within tax-advantaged accounts due to their growth potential and tax treatment.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your investment allocations across all accounts to ensure they align with your overall investment strategy and goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, seeking guidance from a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that suits your individual circumstances.

Remember, the ideal distribution can vary based on personal financial goals, tax situations, and investment horizons, so it's important to consider your unique situation when making these decisions.
