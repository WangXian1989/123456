It’s important to consider several factors when distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, including your current tax situation, future income expectations, and retirement goals. Here’s a general approach you can follow:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits that can significantly enhance your savings over time.
   - **401(k)**: If you’re under 50, you can contribute up to $20,500 (as of 2023). If you're 50 or older, there’s a catch-up contribution of an additional $6,500.
   - **IRA**: You can contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50+). Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth in retirement.

3. **Tax Diversification**: Hold a mix of pre-tax accounts (like traditional 401(k) and IRA) for tax-deferred growth and after-tax accounts (like Roth IRA and taxable accounts) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This strategy can provide flexibility in managing taxes in retirement.

4. **Evaluate Debt and Emergency Savings**: Before investing heavily in these accounts, ensure you’re not neglecting high-interest debt repayment and maintaining an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Contribute to Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide liquidity and more flexible access to your funds without penalties.

6. **Investment Strategy**: Consider a diversified investment strategy that matches your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, a long-term approach with a mix of stocks and bonds is advisable.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and account allocations. Adjust as necessary based on market conditions, life changes, or shifts in your retirement goals.

In any case, it may be wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
