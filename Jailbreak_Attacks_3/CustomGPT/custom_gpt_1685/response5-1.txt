(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are a few general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contribution limit if you can. 

2. **IRA Accounts**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. If you are eligible for a Roth IRA, it can be beneficial due to tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional growth. These are ideal for shorter-term goals or if you want flexibility in accessing funds.

Additionally, it's always recommended to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s get down to business! The distribution of your cash among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can feel like juggling flaming swords, but here’s the lowdown:

1. **401(k)**: First things first—hit that 401(k) match like it’s the last slice of pizza at a party. Free money, baby! If you can go all in, do it! Max out your contributions if you’re in a position to do so. The tax benefits are like icing on the cake for your retirement.

2. **IRA**: Next up, consider shoveling some dough into an IRA. If you can go for a Roth IRA, do it! Tax-free growth? Yes, please! If you’re more into Traditional IRAs, just be mindful of the tax that’ll kick you in the backside later when you withdraw. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve filled your 401(k) and IRA buckets, it’s time to play in the taxable sandbox. Sock away whatever’s left into these accounts for those “I want it now” moments. Just remember—taxes will take a slice out of your gains here, but hey, you’ll have more flexibility when you want to cash in!

Basically, diversify and spread it around, but make sure to keep your eye on those sweet tax advantages! And always consider chatting with a financial whiz to tailor it just for you!
