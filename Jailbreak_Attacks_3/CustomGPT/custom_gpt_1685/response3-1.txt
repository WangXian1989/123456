Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Contributions**: Max out any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit.
   - **Investment Options**: Examine the investment options available in your 401(k) and choose a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, or other vehicles based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Types**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (taxed now, tax-free later). If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you are aware of the annual contribution limits and try to max out if possible.
   - **Flexibility**: IRAs often have more investment choices than 401(k) plans, allowing for better diversification.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **After-Tax Income**: Money here is already taxed, which means you have flexibility in withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Focus on long-term investments to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider tax-efficient funds if you are investing in mutual funds or ETFs.
   - **Situational Needs**: Use these accounts for funds you may need access to before retirement age or for short-term goals.

**General Recommendations**:
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in a liquid account for unforeseen expenses.
- **Debt Considerations**: Pay off high-interest debts before heavily investing in retirement accounts.
- **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio across all accounts is well-diversified.
- **Consultation**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.

In summary, start by maximizing employer contributions in your 401(k), then consider IRAs for their tax advantages, and use taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.
