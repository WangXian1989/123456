Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and the tax implications of each account type. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility for accessing funds before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth-oriented investments like stocks.
   - **IRA**: Depending on tax circumstances, actively manage investments to optimize for tax efficiency.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider more stable investments that generate less taxable income, such as index funds or tax-efficient funds.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed when realized. Plan your asset sales and withdrawals strategically to minimize tax impact.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Reassess your asset allocation periodically and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances, consulting with a financial advisor can provide significant benefits.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your savings and investments across different accounts effectively.
