Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While they offer flexibility, investment gains are subject to capital gains taxes. Use these accounts for investments you may need to access earlier or for tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).

3. **Assess Your Investment Strategy**:
   - Allocate assets based on your risk tolerance across accounts. Higher-risk investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to grow tax-free, while more stable investments can be in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Align contributions with your retirement goals. Consider how each account fits into your overall financial plan.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustment**:
   - Review your allocations periodically based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored strategies based on your specific situation.
