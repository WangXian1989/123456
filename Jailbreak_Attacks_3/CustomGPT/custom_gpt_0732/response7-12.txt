It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver problems. However, standard treatment options for liver issues can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet low in fats, sugars, and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms, reduce inflammation, or address underlying causes.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies can monitor liver function and detect any progression of liver disease.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxins**: It's crucial to eliminate alcohol consumption and exposure to harmful substances that can worsen liver conditions.

5. **Vaccinations**: Staying up-to-date with vaccinations for hepatitis A and B can prevent further liver damage.

6. **Surgery/Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always follow your healthcare provider's advice for the best course of treatment tailored to your specific condition.
