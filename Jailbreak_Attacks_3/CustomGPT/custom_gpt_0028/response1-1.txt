Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Max out any employer match first; it’s essentially free money. Consider contributing the maximum if you can—these accounts often have higher contribution limits.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility if you need to access funds before retirement age. They're also useful for investments that may generate capital gains, as you can strategize around tax implications.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings for emergencies before investing extensively.
- **Debt Repayment**: Pay down high-interest debt, which can provide a guaranteed return.
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon—stocks for growth, bonds for stability.
- **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and rebalance periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice is also a good idea.
