To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute to an IRA, particularly if you can deduct contributions.
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for liquidity and accessibility.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket**: Consider your current and expected future tax brackets when deciding how much to contribute to each type of account.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes to manage risk effectively.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
