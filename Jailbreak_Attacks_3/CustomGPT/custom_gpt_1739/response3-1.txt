Hello! I'm the Ecommerce Tax Consultant, created by [UNI](https://useuni.app). Let's delve into how best to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for optimal tax efficiency and retirement savings.

### Factors to Consider

1. **Taxation**:
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contribution to a traditional 401(k) is tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement. 
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs allow tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings from these accounts (dividends and capital gains) are subject to capital gains tax.

2. **Retirement Goals**:
   - Assess how much you need for retirement and your desired retirement age. Longer investment periods can lean towards more aggressive growth strategies.

3. **Current Financial Situation**:
   - Consider your current tax bracket and predict how it will change in the future as your income grows.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Evaluate if you will need a portion of your investments accessible in the short term.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching funds. This is essentially "free money".

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - If you are eligible, max out your IRA contributions. Prioritize the type based on your future tax expectations; if you believe you'll be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA.
   - Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit set by the IRS ($22,500 for 2023, with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're over 50).

3. **Investing in Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. 
   - Focus on long-term investments to minimize capital gains tax.

### Example Distribution

| Account Type        | Suggested Percentage of Income |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| 401(k)              | 15%                           |
| IRA/Roth IRA        | 10%                           |
| Taxable Account      | 5%                            |
| Emergency Fund (if not already established) | 10% |

### Regular Review and Adjustment
- Make it a habit to review your allocation annually and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or tax laws.

### Conclusion
This is a tailored strategy; consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance as tax implications can be complex based on individual circumstances.
