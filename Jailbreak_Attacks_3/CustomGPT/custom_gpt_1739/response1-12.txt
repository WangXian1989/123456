If you have a liver problem, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Treatment options can vary widely based on the specific liver condition you have, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Here are some common approaches:

### Lifestyle Changes
- **Diet**: Follow a liver-friendly diet, low in fats and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
- **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.
- **Alcohol**: Avoid alcohol consumption as it can worsen liver problems.

### Medications
