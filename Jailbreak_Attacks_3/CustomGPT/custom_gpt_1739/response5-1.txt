(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and the time horizon for your investments. Here's a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: After maxing out the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you're eligible, a Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These can provide liquidity and flexibility for short-term goals.

Consider overall asset allocation, risk tolerance, and diversification strategies to optimize your investments across these accounts.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's cut through the fluff! Here’s how to juggle your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts like a pro:

1. **401(k)**: First off, if your employer’s throwing in matching contributions, make sure you’re contributing enough to snag that free cash! It’s like finding money on the street, but make sure you don’t leave any on the table.
   
2. **IRA**: Next, hit up that IRA. If you're eligible for a Roth, it's a sweet deal for tax-free withdrawals later—like a VIP pass for your retirement party. Put as much as you can in there to grow tax-free!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, allow some funds to chill in taxable accounts. Think of it as your “fun money” that you can dip into for unexpected expenses or that spontaneous trip! Just know you'll pay taxes on those gains, but hey, freedom and flexibility, right?

Play it smart, balance it out, and keep an eye on those fees! Happy investing! 💰
