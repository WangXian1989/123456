When considering how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider for optimal tax efficiency and long-term growth. Here's a general guideline:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Always contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; this is free money!
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50 or older).
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Decide whether to contribute to a Roth IRA (taxed now, tax-free withdrawals later) or a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes upon withdrawal).
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older).
   - **Eligibility:** Check your income limits for Roth contributions.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Long-Term Investing:** Consider using taxable accounts for investments with favorable tax rates (like long-term capital gains).
   - **Flexibility:** Money is accessible without penalties, which can be helpful for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficient Investments:** Use tax-efficient funds or securities that yield qualified dividends.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out your 401(k)** contributions up to the employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA** up to the limit, prefer a Roth if you're eligible.
- **Invest any remaining funds** in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity, focusing on low-turnover and tax-efficient investments.

### Important Considerations:
- **Current Tax Bracket:** Your current income and future projections may influence the decision between tax-deferred and taxable accounts.
- **Retirement Age:** Longer time horizons may favor more aggressive strategies.
