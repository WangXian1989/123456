The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a breakdown of how you might approach allocating your contributions:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**:
     - **Tax Advantage**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth).
     - **Employer Match**: Contribute up to the employer match if available.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - **Flexibility**: No restrictions on withdrawals; subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Consider Your Contribution Strategy**:
   1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions.
   2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: Contribute to your IRA next, either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   3. **Continue to 401(k)**: If you still have funds available, consider increasing your contribution to your 401(k) to the maximum limit. In 2023, the limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if 50 or older).
   4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional savings or investment flexibility.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**: 
   - Assess your current and projected future tax brackets to determine the benefits of contributing to traditional vs. Roth accounts.
   - Taxable accounts can be beneficial for short-term goals and might offer tax advantages based on capital gains and dividend rates.

### 4. **Risk Tolerance and Investment Strategy**:
   - Understand your risk tolerance and investment horizon when choosing asset allocation across these accounts.
   - Diversify your investments within each account to balance risk and growth potential.

### 5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your investment strategy and make adjustments based on changes in income, expenses, and life circumstances.

### Suggested Distribution Example:
| Account Type         | Recommended Focus                       |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 401(k)               | Maximize to employer match; then 15-20% |
| IRA                  | Max out contributions ($6,500 yearly)   |
| Taxable Account      | Invest excess funds after maximizing above |

### Conclusion:
The best distribution will vary based on individual circumstances, so it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial planner or tax advisor to tailor the approach to your specific needs.
