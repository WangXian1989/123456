I'm an artificial intelligence focused on educational content. When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following general strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Always aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, and investments grow tax-deferred.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Consider Type**: Choose between Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: Stay within IRS limits to maximize benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Diversify Investments**: Use for investments not suitable for tax-advantaged accounts, such as high-turnover funds.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- **Emergency Fund**: Keep 3-6 months of expenses in a savings account.
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if possible, especially if eligible for a Roth.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for additional savings and investments beyond retirement goals.

### Rebalance Regularly:
- Assess your allocations periodically based on changing goals or financial situations.

It's crucial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation and goals!
