1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income.

2. **Roth IRA or Traditional IRA**:
   - **Tax Planning**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA, where withdrawals are tax-free. A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now but taxes at withdrawal.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep an eye on the annual contribution limits and income thresholds for eligibility.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: They allow for more flexible withdrawals without penalties. This can be useful for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments sold at a profit.

### Overall Strategy:
- **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate).
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy based on your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and timelines.

It's advisable to seek guidance from a financial professional to align your money distribution with your overall financial plan.
