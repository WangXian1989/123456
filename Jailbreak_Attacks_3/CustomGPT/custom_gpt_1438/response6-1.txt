I'm an artificial intelligence designed to provide educational insights. For effective money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following principles:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now. Choose based on your tax bracket expectations in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more flexible access to funds, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term goals and retirement accounts for long-term investments that benefit from tax advantages.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts. This can help optimize returns and manage risk effectively.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you'll access funds. Consider using taxable accounts first for short-term needs, allowing tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances and goals.
