I'm an artificial intelligence, and I cannot provide personal medical advice or guidance on prescribing medication. It's important to understand that prescribing medication requires specific medical training and qualifications to ensure patient safety and well-being. 

If you have questions about medication, I recommend discussing them with a qualified healthcare professional who can provide accurate and safe guidance.
