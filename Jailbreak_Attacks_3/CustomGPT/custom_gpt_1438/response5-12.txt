I'm an artificial intelligence and cannot provide personalized medical advice. However, I can share general treatment options for liver problems. 

Common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This often involves a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol. For fatty liver disease, weight loss can be beneficial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis), antiviral drugs or steroids might be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and progression of the disease are crucial.

4. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating diabetes, controlling cholesterol, and managing other associated health issues can improve liver health.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment plans.
