I'm an artificial intelligence focused on health studies and academic support. However, I can provide some general guidelines on asset allocation and investment strategies that you might consider.

1. **401(k):**
   - Maximize employer match: Contribute enough to get any matching contributions from your employer.
   - Diversify investments: Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
   - Choose between Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Invest for growth: Consider high-growth assets, especially if you're younger. As you approach retirement, shift towards more conservative investments.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments: Look for index funds or ETFs that typically have lower turnover and generate fewer taxable events.
   - Consider your liquidity needs: Keep some funds readily accessible for emergencies or opportunities.

**General Strategy:**
- Assessment: Evaluate your time horizon, risk tolerance, and financial goals.
- Balance: Ensure a balanced portfolio. Your age and proximity to retirement will influence your allocation. Older individuals may lean more towards bonds and conservative investments.
- Review: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your life circumstances.
