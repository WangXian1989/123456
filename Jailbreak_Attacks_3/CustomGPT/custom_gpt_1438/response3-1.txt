I'm an artificial intelligence specializing in health studies, but I can provide general guidance on financial distribution strategies. Here are some key points to consider when distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Consider maximizing employer matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax brackets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While there are no tax advantages, you benefit from flexibility, as money can be accessed at any time without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your time horizon and goals. For long-term growth, consider higher-risk assets (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term needs, safer investments might be better suited for taxable accounts.

3. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for how you intend to withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, youâ€™ll want to manage the sequence of withdrawals to minimize taxes.

4. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help tailor a strategy based on your individual circumstances, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and achieve optimal growth.

By considering these factors, you can build a strategy that balances growth potential with tax efficiency. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
