I'm an artificial intelligence specializing in health studies, and I can guide you on general concepts related to investment accounts. However, I can't provide personalized financial advice. 

In general, the distribution of funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA are often tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals; they’re funded with after-tax dollars.
   - Taxable accounts may require you to pay capital gains taxes on earnings.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Long-term goals might favor tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRAs.
   - Short-term needs or flexibility may be better suited for taxable accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each type of account, as they can influence your strategy.

4. **Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), it’s typically wise to contribute enough to take full advantage of that.

Considering these factors, it’s best to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that meets your specific financial situation and goals.
