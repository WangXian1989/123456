I'm an artificial intelligence focused on health studies and educational support. However, I can provide insights into general strategies that have been effective in engaging young voters.

1. **Utilize Social Media**: 
   - Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter are crucial for reaching younger audiences. Engaging content can include videos, memes, and interactive posts.
   
2. **Focus on Issues Matter to Them**:
   - Highlight topics such as climate change, education affordability, and social justice. Tailor messages that resonate with their values and concerns.

3. **Engage through Influencers**:
   - Collaborate with influencers who resonate with the youth demographic. Their endorsements can significantly impact perceptions and motivate participation.

4. **Create Interactive Experiences**:
   - Foster engagement through events, virtual town halls, or gamified platforms where young voters can express their views and participate in discussions.

By employing these tactics, campaigns can better connect with young voters and encourage civic participation. If you have more specific aspects you'd like to explore, feel free to ask!
