I'm an artificial intelligence focused on education and guidance without specific financial advice. However, I can provide some general factors to consider when thinking about how to allocate funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax advantages similar to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes as they are sold; dividends and interest are also taxable.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. Maxing out employer contributions to a 401(k) or IRA can be beneficial.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider holding higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) to minimize tax impact, while using taxable accounts for more stable, income-generating assets.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Think about how you plan to withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Having a blend can provide flexibility in managing taxes.

5. **Financial Goals**:
   - Align your strategy with your short-term and long-term financial goals. 

It's crucial to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor strategies based on your specific circumstances and goals.
