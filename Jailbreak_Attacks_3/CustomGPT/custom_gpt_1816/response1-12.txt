It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice, but common treatment options for liver problems can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** Maintaining a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and exercising regularly can improve liver health.
  
2. **Medications:** Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and liver function tests to keep track of your condition.

4. **Surgery or Procedures:** In some cases, procedures may be needed to remove blockages or even a liver transplant for severe liver damage.

Always follow your doctor's recommendations for the best outcome.
