It's great that you're thinking about how to effectively distribute your money across different investment accounts! Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **401(k) (Employer-Sponsored Plan)**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Pre-Tax vs. Roth Options:** If your employer offers a Roth 401(k), weigh the benefits of tax-free growth versus tax-deferred contributions, depending on your current and future tax situation.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Choose the Right Type:** Depending on your income level and tax situation, decide between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribute Early:** Try to max out your IRA contributions as early in the year as possible to take advantage of compounding growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexible Access:** Use taxable accounts for savings goals with shorter timelines. Place investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax implications.
   - **Diversity in Investments:** You can invest in a broader range of assets in taxable accounts. Consider options like index funds or ETFs that are tax-efficient.

### General Tips:
- **Balance Your Risk:** Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and retirement goals.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your changing financial situation and market conditions.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized insights.

By thoughtfully considering how to allocate your contributions, you'll set yourself up for a more secure financial future.
