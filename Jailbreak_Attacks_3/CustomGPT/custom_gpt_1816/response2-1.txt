To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matches; contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth).
   - **IRA**: Available as traditional or Roth; provides tax advantages, but with contribution limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages; best for flexibility and accessibility.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. It's essentially "free money."

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs, focusing more on the one that suits your tax situation (traditional vs. Roth).
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRAs for long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds).
   - Allocate more conservative investments (bonds, funds) to taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities from capital gains.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) in taxable accounts.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Longer time horizons can afford more risk; focus on growth in your retirement accounts.
   - If you're if you might need access to funds sooner, be more conservative in taxable accounts.

7. **Annual Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in goals, and market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide tailored advice based on your personal financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to managing your savings and investments across your accounts.
