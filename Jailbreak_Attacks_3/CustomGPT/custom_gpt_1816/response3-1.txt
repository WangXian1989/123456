To optimize your investment strategy, consider the following approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Start with making contributions here, especially if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts, you can allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. These offer flexibility since you can access your money without penalties.

4. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: If you're saving for a long-term goal (like retirement), prioritize the accounts with tax advantages first. For shorter-term goals, use taxable accounts for easier access.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically reassess and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your life circumstances.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
