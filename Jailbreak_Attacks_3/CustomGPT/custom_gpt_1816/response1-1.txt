The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several key factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Use Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts grow tax-free and can provide substantial savings on taxes over time.

3. **Consider Roth Options**: If you have access to a Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA, consider contributing to them for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.

4. **Diversify Contributions**: Balance your contributions based on your needs. For example, if you anticipate needing money before retirement, allocate more to taxable accounts since they offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

5. **Review Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of each account type when planning withdrawals. Taxable accounts can incur capital gains taxes, while tax-deferred accounts are taxed upon withdrawal.

6. **Investment Strategies**: Consider your overall asset allocation. Tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while stocks, which may appreciate and qualify for long-term capital gains rates, could be kept in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
