To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: Maximize your employer's match first. Contribute enough to benefit from any match, which is essentially free money. If you can, aim to reach the annual contribution limit.

2. **IRA Accounts**: If you qualify, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're looking for immediate tax benefits, a traditional IRA might be more suitable. Focus on maximizing contributions to this account as well.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), allocate your investment to taxable accounts. This allows for greater flexibility in accessing funds without penalties and provides opportunities for capital gains and dividend income.

### General Allocation Strategies:
- **Emergency Fund**: Before allocating to investments, ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses in an easily accessible account.
- **Age-Based Allocation**: A common strategy is to reduce risk as you age. A younger investor might have more equity exposure, gradually shifting towards bonds as retirement nears.
- **Diversification**: Ensure a mixture of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts to mitigate risk.
- **Consider Tax Implications**: Higher growth investments (like stocks) might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable, income-generating investments can go into taxable accounts for favorable long-term capital gains.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your financial situation and retirement goals.
