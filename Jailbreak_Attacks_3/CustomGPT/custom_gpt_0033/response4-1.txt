Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are generally pre-tax, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal. This can reduce your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider using these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, which can be taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) & IRA**: Focus on long-term investments like stocks or mutual funds. Given the long-term horizon, you might afford to take on more risk.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for shorter-term goals or more conservative investments if you anticipate needing the funds sooner.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Overall Asset Allocation**:
   - Aim for a balanced portfolio based on your risk tolerance. Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account type.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your accounts to ensure your investment strategy aligns with your evolving goals and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your income to maximize employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions (e.g., $6,500 for 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on longer-term investments.
