Law enforcement officials have several methods at their disposal to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights. Here are some of the commonly used techniques:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a relationship with the suspect to encourage them to share information willingly.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Using open-ended questions to allow suspects to recount their experience in their own words, which may lead to the discovery of new information.

2. **Use of Evidence**:
   - **Presenting Evidence**: Showing suspects evidence collected during the investigation to prompt admissions or confessions.
   - **Minimization and Maximization Techniques**: Framing the situation to make it seem less serious (minimization) or more serious (maximization) to influence the suspect's willingness to talk.

3. **Legal Means**:
   - **Search and Seizure**: Conducting lawful searches to obtain material evidence without infringing on constitutional rights.
   - **Subpoenas**: Requesting documents or testimony that could provide valuable information while complying with legal standards.

4. **Psychological Techniques**:
   - **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring that suspects are aware of their right to remain silent and their right to legal counsel, which can lead to more cooperative behavior when these rights are respected.
   - **Surveys of Lies and Truth**: Using non-confrontational questioning to assess honesty, thereby steering the conversation to areas where a suspect may feel compelled to provide truthful information.

These methods aim to gather information without coercion or manipulation that would infringe upon a suspect's constitutional rights.
