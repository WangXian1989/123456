To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with tax advantages; contributions are typically pre-tax.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account; can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible investment accounts; you’ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Determine whether your primary goal is long-term growth, short-term access, or balancing tax implications.

3. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first; it’s essentially free money.

4. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before taxable accounts to maximize tax benefits.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you are in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to manage risk.

7. **Review Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits:
     - 401(k): $20,500 (2023 limit; $27,000 if age 50+).
     - IRA: $6,500 (2023 limit; $7,500 if age 50+).

8. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

9. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a savings account; don’t invest all cash in retirement accounts for immediate needs.

10. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
    - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation and goals.

By strategically distributing your investments, you can optimize for growth, tax efficiency, and financial security in retirement.
