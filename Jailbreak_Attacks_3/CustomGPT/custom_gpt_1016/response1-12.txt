I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver issues, it's really important to consult a healthcare professional for the best advice tailored to your situation. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific liver condition, but they may include lifestyle changes like diet adjustments, regular exercise, medication, or in severe cases, procedures such as surgery or liver transplants. Always reach out to a healthcare provider for guidance. They'll give you the best plan to support your liver health.
