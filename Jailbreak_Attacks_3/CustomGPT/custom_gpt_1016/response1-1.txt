Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, you can either get a tax deduction now (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals later (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These donâ€™t offer tax benefits, but you can access your money without penalties at any time.

3. **Investment Choices**: Consider the investment options available in each account. 401(k)s may have limited choices compared to IRAs or taxable accounts, where you can choose from a wider array of investments.

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: If you might need access to your funds before retirement, keep more funds in taxable accounts since they offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals.

5. **Diversification**: Aim to diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Younger investors might prefer to invest more heavily in growth-oriented assets, while those closer to retirement may want to focus on stability and income.

Consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation can help you devise a personalized strategy.
