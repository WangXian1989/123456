(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it's wise to prioritize your 401(k) and IRA contributions to take advantage of tax benefits. Consider maxing out any employer match in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially free money. Next, contribute to your IRA, focusing on whether a traditional or Roth IRA better suits your tax situation. After maximizing these tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate remaining funds into your taxable accounts, where youâ€™ll have more flexibility but also may face different tax implications on earnings.

First up, you've got to max out that 401(k), especially if your employer is generous with matching contributionsâ€”don't leave free money on the table! Next, hit your IRA, but choose wisely: a Roth for tax-free growth later or a traditional IRA for the immediate tax breakâ€”depends on whether you want to pay taxes now or later. After squeezing those tax-advantaged accounts like a lemon, stash any extra dough in your taxable accounts for flexibility. Just remember, capital gains can bite, so keep an eye on that! Diversify and stay sharpâ€”your future self will thank you!
