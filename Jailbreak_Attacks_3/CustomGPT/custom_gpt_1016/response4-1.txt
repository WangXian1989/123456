To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it during retirement. Depending on your employer's plan, there might be a matching contribution, which is a benefit to prioritize.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, so if you believe you'll be in a higher tax bracket later, this might be a beneficial avenue.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, but these can be managed through tax-loss harvesting strategies.

2. **Retirement Goals**: 
   - Assess your retirement timeline. If you're closer to retirement, you might want to lean towards accounts that provide tax advantages and compound growth like 401(k)s and IRAs.
   - Consider if you have specific goals or needs for your taxable accounts, such as purchasing a home or funding education.

3. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), while for IRAs it is $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50 or older). 

4. **Investment Options and Fees**: 
   - Evaluate the investment options available within your 401(k) plan. If your plan has high fees or limited investment choices, it might make more sense to contribute to an IRA or taxable account instead.
   - Consider your risk tolerance and diversify investments across all accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have a suitable emergency fund in place before heavily investing in retirement accounts. This fund should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.

A tailored distribution strategy typically involves maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first before considering contributions to taxable accounts.
