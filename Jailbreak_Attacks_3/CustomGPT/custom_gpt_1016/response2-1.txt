Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions here. Consider contributing the maximum allowed if you're in a higher tax bracket, as this can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maxing out your 401(k) matching, contribute to an IRA. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider it for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
  
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This is particularly useful for short-term goals or if you need flexibility in accessing funds.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Think about what investments to include in each account type:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Consider holding assets that generate high taxable income (like bonds), since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: This is a good place for high-growth stocks, as you won't pay taxes on qualified withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that provide tax efficiency, such as index funds or tax-managed funds, which tend to generate lower short-term capital gains.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation, market performance, or retirement goals.
