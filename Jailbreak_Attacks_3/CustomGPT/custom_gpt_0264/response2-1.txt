To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, maximize this first. Consider contributing to a traditional 401(k) for tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k) match, focus on a Roth IRA if you're eligible, for tax-free growth. Otherwise, contribute to a traditional IRA for tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement. This is good for flexibility.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains distributions.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account for balanced risk.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and adjust your allocations annually to maintain your desired risk level and adapt to changes in goals or market conditions.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful about where you place certain assets—interest income and short-term gains are taxed at ordinary rates in taxable accounts, while long-term holdings can be more tax-efficient.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
