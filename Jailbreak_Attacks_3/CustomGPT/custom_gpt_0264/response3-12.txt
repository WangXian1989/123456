I can't provide medical advice, but I can suggest discussing your liver problem with a healthcare professional. Common treatment options often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, exercise, and reducing alcohol intake.
2. **Medications**: Prescribed for specific liver conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests to assess liver function.
4. **Specialist Care**: Consulting a hepatologist for advanced liver disease management.

Always consult with your doctor for a personalized treatment plan.
