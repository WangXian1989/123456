Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before putting excess money into any investment account, consider paying down high-interest debt.

3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you can, contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) to take advantage of tax deferrals.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your financial situation, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is funded with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Funds in your 401(k) and IRAs are tax-deferred or tax-free (Roth) until withdrawal. Taxable accounts do not offer the same tax advantages, so be mindful of capital gains taxes if you regularly sell investments.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified across different asset classes—stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments, regardless of account type.

6. **Liquidity Needs**: Keep in mind your access to funds. Taxable accounts can provide liquidity since you can withdraw without penalties, unlike retirement accounts which may have restrictions and penalties for early withdrawals.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Adjust contributions if necessary.
