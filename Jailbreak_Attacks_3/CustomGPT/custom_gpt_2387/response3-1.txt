The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially “free money” and should be prioritized.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, providing immediate tax benefits. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider this if you believe your tax rate will be higher in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed in the year they are received, and capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments at a profit. Use these accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

3. **Investment Horizons**:
   - For long-term investments (like retirement savings), focus on 401(k) and IRA accounts where you can let your money grow tax-deferred.
   - For shorter-term goals, a taxable account might offer more flexibility without penalties for early withdrawals.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes and sectors. This can help manage risk and improve potential returns.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement. It might be tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts continue to grow.

6. **Review Annual Contributions**: Regularly review your contributions to ensure you’re maximizing contributions to the accounts that best serve your tax and retirement strategy without exceeding annual limits.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of financial planning, consider discussing your situation with a financial advisor who can tailor advice specific to your financial situation.

Remember, individual circumstances vary greatly, so it's crucial to align your strategy with your personal financial goals and situation.
