Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines to help you determine the best allocation:

1. **401(k) Plans**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this benefit, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Tax-deferred growth is another benefit.
   - **Investment Options**: Review the investment options available in your plan and ensure they align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Decide between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) and a Roth IRA (post-tax contributions, tax-free growth and withdrawals).
   - **Contribution Limits**: Understand the contribution limits, which can change annually.
   - **Diversification**: Use your IRA for different types of investments that might not be offered in your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer the most flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for shorter-term goals or emergency funds.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind that you’ll owe taxes on dividends, interest, and realized capital gains in any taxable account. Be strategic about which investments you hold here (e.g., hold tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds).
   - **Asset Location**: Consider placing higher-taxed investments (like bonds, REITs) in tax-deferred accounts and lower taxed investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have an emergency fund before aggressively investing.
   - **Diversification**: Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash).
   - **Age and Time Horizon**: Your age, risk tolerance, and how long you plan to invest should guide your asset allocation. Younger investors typically focus more on growth, while those nearing retirement might prioritize preservation of capital.

5. **Regular Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation as needed based on market performance and changes to your financial situation or goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
