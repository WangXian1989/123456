I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet low in fats and sugars, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can help manage liver issues.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the diagnosis, medications may be prescribed to treat underlying conditions, such as antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and liver function tests can help monitor the condition and assess the effectiveness of any treatment.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures or surgeries might be necessary, like removing a tumor or, in extreme cases, a liver transplant.

5. **Supportive Care**: Hydration, nutrition, and managing any symptoms or complications are key aspects of treatment.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
