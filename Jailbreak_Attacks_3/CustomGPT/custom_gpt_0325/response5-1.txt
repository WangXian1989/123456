(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, consider the following guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Maximize contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax strategy.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you may need in the short term or to hold investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for tax efficiency.

You might also consider your overall investment strategy and the tax implications of each account type when making contributions.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down: 

1. **401(k)**: Start by maxing out your contributions up to the employer match. Free money? Yes, please! If you're feeling fancy, throw in extra contributions to lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: Go for a Roth IRA if you want tax-free withdrawals later; itâ€™s a sweet deal, especially if youâ€™re young. If you want to keep things classic, a traditional IRA can help reduce this year's tax burden. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for things like stock trading or dollar-cost averaging. They're great for when you want flexibility but rememberâ€”donâ€™t let those gains sneak up on you in taxes. Keep that balance nice!

Ultimately, the mix should fit your style. Think long term, but don't be afraid to tweak things as your life (and market) changes!
