Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, retirement goals, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: In 2023, the maximum contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA**: Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates. If you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA might be better.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: The 2023 limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or for money you might need access to before retirement.
   - **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-exempt bonds, to minimize taxes on gains.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have an emergency fund with 3-6 months of living expenses.
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on 401(k) and IRA contributions before taxable accounts for potential tax benefits.
- **Assess Your Time Horizon**: Longer-term investments can be more aggressive, while shorter-term goals might require more conservative allocations.

### Rebalance Regularly:
- Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changing goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can optimize your strategy based on personal circumstances.
