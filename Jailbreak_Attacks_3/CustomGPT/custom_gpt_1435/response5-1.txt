(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If youâ€™re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts can be useful for goals outside of retirement, but keep in mind they donâ€™t have the same tax advantages. Consider using these for more liquid investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your overall investment strategy is balanced between stocks and bonds, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals.

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer tosses in free cash (aka a match), max that out! You're leaving money on the table if you donâ€™t.

2. **IRA Time**: Next, hit up your IRA. If you're going for tax-free growth, Roth IRA is the way to go â€” just know the rules and income limits. Otherwise, Traditional IRA is solid for tax deductions up front.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are your flexible buddies for mid-term goals or fun cash. Just be mindful of those pesky taxes on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Balance Your Bets**: Keep your investment game lively! Mix up stocks and bonds based on how much risk you can handle and how far off retirement is. 

5. **Keep Tabs**: Donâ€™t ghost your accounts! Regular check-ins to adjust your allocations will help keep your financial ship sailing straight.

So, stack that cash smartly, and watch it grow! ðŸ’¸
