Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Money grows tax-deferred, but you’ll owe taxes upon withdrawal. Prioritize these accounts if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider prioritizing this if you believe your tax rate will increase.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for short-term goals and flexibility. Investments in taxable accounts incur capital gains taxes, but can be beneficial for investing in assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Stocks may be more suitable for long-term growth in tax-deferred accounts, while bonds or cash might be better for taxable accounts considering tax implications.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing. After that, look to pull from tax-deferred accounts and finally taxable accounts as needed.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations as your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement approaches.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
