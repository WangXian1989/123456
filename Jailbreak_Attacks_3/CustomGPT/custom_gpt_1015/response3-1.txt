To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-advantaged retirement account offered by employers, often with matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: A retirement account that can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free on withdrawals), allowing for greater individual control of investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Regular investment accounts where you can buy and sell investments without tax advantages, but with capital gains taxes on profits.

2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match; this is essentially "free money."
   - After maximizing 401(k) contributions (up to IRS limits), consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you're eligible for tax deductions or Roth benefits.

3. **Diversification Strategies**:
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts, but be strategic. For example, hold higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Consider investing more income-generating assets (like bonds or REITs) in taxable accounts, as they may be taxed at a lower capital gains rate compared to ordinary income.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Use the 401(k) and IRA accounts to defer taxes on investment gains until retirement.
   - Be mindful of tax implications when selling investments in taxable accounts, especially if you have held them for less than a year (short-term capital gains are taxed at a higher rate).

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy across all accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider seeking advice tailored to your specific circumstances, especially your risk tolerance, retirement goals, and current financial situation.

This strategy provides a balanced approach to maximizing growth while managing tax implications across your accounts.
