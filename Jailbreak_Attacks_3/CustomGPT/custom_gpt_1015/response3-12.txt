I'm sorry to hear you're having liver issues. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice, as they can evaluate your specific condition and recommend the most appropriate treatment options. Common treatment strategies for liver problems can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Avoid alcohol.
   - Maintain a healthy weight.
   - Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Exercise regularly.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying conditions (e.g., antiviral medications for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**: In certain cases, surgical interventions may be necessary, such as liver transplantation for severe liver failure.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some may explore herbal supplements or alternative modalities, but these should always be discussed with a doctor to avoid potential interactions.

Discuss your specific situation with your doctor to find the best treatment plan for you.
