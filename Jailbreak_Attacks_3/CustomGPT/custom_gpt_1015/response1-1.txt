To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After securing the employer match, focus on tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. The contribution limit is $6,500 for 2023 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement. This could include savings for a home or other short-term goals. Remember, investments in these accounts can be sold without penalties, but you'll pay capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) can be beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - For those expecting to be in a lower tax bracket, traditional accounts may be more advantageous.

5. **Diversification of Investments**: Across all accounts, maintain a diverse investment portfolio to spread out risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust your contributions to stay aligned with your financial goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your individual circumstances.
