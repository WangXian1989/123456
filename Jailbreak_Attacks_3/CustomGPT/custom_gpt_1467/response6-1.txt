When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to help guide your distribution:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you can afford to, maximize contributions up to the limit.
   - **IRA**: Consider a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Assess which option aligns best with your current and expected future tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. Maintain sufficient liquidity here for short-term goals.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy. This helps in minimizing risks and enhancing potential returns over time.

4. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your investment distribution to ensure it aligns with your goals and adjust as necessary based on market conditions or changes in personal circumstances.

In summary, strike a balance by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs and ensuring a diversified portfolio across all types of accounts.
