When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to factor in tax implications, investment goals, and your overall financial situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Account**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - Consider maxing out contributions if you're able, as this reduces your taxable income in the present.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This may be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront, which can be advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be lower during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Taxable accounts are useful for short-term goals or if you want more flexibility with withdrawals.
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Overall Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund before maximizing retirement accounts.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
- **Maximize Tax Advantages**: Use tax-advantaged accounts as much as possible before funding taxable accounts.
- **Long-term Planning**: Align your contributions with your long-term financial goals for retirement and other life events.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
