Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA. A Roth IRA is ideal for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket upon retirement.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: If you still have money to invest, contribute more to your 401(k) up to its limit. This account often has higher contribution limits and potential tax benefits.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for money you may need in the short term or for investments that may generate capital gains tax. This is also a good place to hold investments that produce qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced investment strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
