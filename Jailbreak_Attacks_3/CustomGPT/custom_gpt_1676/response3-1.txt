Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand the Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching and tax advantages for retirement saving. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, taxed upon withdrawal. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible investment options with no tax advantages. Capital gains are taxed when investments are sold.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match first; it's essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Maximize contributions to your IRA, particularly Roth for tax-free growth (if eligible based on income).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing the above, consider using taxable accounts for investments.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to minimize taxes on gains.
   - Fixed-income investments (bonds) or high-dividend stocks may be better suited for taxable accounts due to lower rates on qualified dividends.

### 4. **Strategize for Withdrawals**
   - Plan withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize tax impacts, considering the order: taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA), and lastly, tax-free (Roth IRA).

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, retirement goals, and market conditions.

### Summary
- **Max Out the 401(k)** to get full employer match.
- **Max Out the IRA** for retirement savings.
- **Use Taxable Accounts** for additional investments or short-term financial goals.

### Final Note
Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
