To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed each year, focusing on a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: A traditional IRA also offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax burdens (long-term capital gains, qualified dividends).

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Generally, hold more growth-oriented investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding bonds or other interest-bearing investments in these accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diverse asset allocation across all accounts, adjusting based on the account type and purpose.

5. **Withdrawals and Planning**:
   - Plan for how and when you'll withdraw funds in retirement, considering tax implications for each account type.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on market performance and life changes.
