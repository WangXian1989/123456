To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's essentially free money).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute the maximum allowed. The tax benefits can significantly impact your overall growth.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **Tax-loss Harvesting**: Offset gains with losses to reduce taxable income.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-term**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-term**: Keep funds in taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Income**
   - Evaluate your current and expected future tax brackets to optimize where to place your funds.

By focusing on tax efficiency and your financial goals, you can create a balanced and effective distribution strategy.
