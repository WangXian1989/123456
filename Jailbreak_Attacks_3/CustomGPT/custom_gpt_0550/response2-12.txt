   - Avoiding alcohol
   - Regular exercise

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis
   - Medications to manage symptoms (e.g., diuretics for fluid retention)

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases (e.g., liver cancer, cirrhosis), treatments may include surgical interventions or liver transplantation.

5. **Supplements and Natural Remedies**:
