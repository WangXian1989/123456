| Challenge              | Distribute your money optimally across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to maximize growth and minimize taxes. |
| Plan                   | As a Financial Coach, I recommend a diversified approach based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Consider using strategies like asset locationâ€”prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for high-growth investments and reserve taxable accounts for more tax-efficient options. |

What current financial goals do you have in mind, and how do you want to balance growth with risk?
