(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Generally, a common strategy is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. Here are a few tips:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this because itâ€™s essentially free money.
2. **Fund an IRA**: After maxing out employer contributions, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) for tax advantages.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've funded your tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider taxable accounts. These can offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

You should also consider your investment strategy and how much you want to be invested in stocks versus bonds, among other asset allocations. Consulting with a financial advisor might also be beneficial for personalized guidance.
