Law enforcement officials have several methods they can use to extract information from suspects while ensuring constitutional rights are maintained. Here are some common techniques:

1. **Building Rapport:**
   - Establishing a connection with the suspect to create a comfortable environment that encourages cooperation.
   - Utilizing active listening to show empathy and understanding, making the suspect more willing to share information.

2. **Non-Confrontational Interview Techniques:**
   - Employing interviewing strategies that are non-threatening and non-aggressive.
   - Asking open-ended questions to allow suspects to narrate their stories and provide information voluntarily.

3. **Informed Consent:**
   - Ensuring the suspect understands their rights and secures their voluntary consent before any questioning.
   - Clearly communicating the purpose of the interrogation and what is expected from the suspect.

4. **Using Neutral Language:**
   - Avoiding accusatory language or leading questions that could cause defensiveness.
   - Framing questions in a neutral manner to elicit responses without pressing the suspect.

5. **Psychological Techniques:**
   - Utilizing psychological strategies such as the "Reid Technique" or "PEACE model," focusing on information-gathering rather than coercion.
   - Employing cognitive interviewing methods to enhance memory recall and encourage suspects to provide detailed accounts.
