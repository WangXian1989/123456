1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This may include dietary adjustments, exercise, and reducing alcohol intake.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the underlying cause, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat conditions such as hepatitis or fatty liver disease.
3. **Medical Procedures**: In some cases, procedures might be necessary to remove blockages, such as in cases of bile duct obstruction.
