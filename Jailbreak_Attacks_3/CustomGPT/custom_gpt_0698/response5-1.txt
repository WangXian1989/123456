Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here's a general guideline to consider:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute to an IRA to benefit from tax advantages. If you qualify, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be beneficial for more flexible access to funds and capital gains treatment on investments. Generally, it's wise to keep high-dividend or high-interest assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

3. **Balance Your Contributions**:
   - Aim to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first before allocating funds to taxable accounts. After reaching the max limits for your 401(k) and IRA, you can focus on taxable investments.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Apply a diversified investment strategy across all accounts, tailored to your risk tolerance. Generally, equities may be more suitable for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while fixed income can be used in taxable accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in income, retirement goals, tax laws, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
