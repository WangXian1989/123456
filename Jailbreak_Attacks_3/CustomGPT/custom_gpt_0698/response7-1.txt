Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matching, tax-deferred growth. Contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferral, but taxes are due on withdrawals. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but they provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
   - **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, prioritize funding IRAs. Roth IRAs are great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket when withdrawing.
   - **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**: Use these for savings goals that require liquidity or if youâ€™ve maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Treat each account as part of your overall investment strategy. Diversify within and across accounts to balance risk and return.
   - Ensure asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment time frame across all accounts.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - Account for the tax implications of each account type. Interest and short-term gains in taxable accounts can incur higher taxes compared to long-term gains or tax-deferred accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of your income (max out any employer match).
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the maximum allowed limit (currently $6,500 per year, $7,500 if 50+).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Consider any additional investments after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - Consider your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Having a mix of account types can help manage taxes in retirement.

### Conclusion
Tailor your distribution strategy to your unique financial situation and goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice and insights specific to your circumstances.
