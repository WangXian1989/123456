Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute the maximum allowed ($22,500 in 2023, or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older). Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you prefer the tax deduction now, go for a traditional IRA (with an annual limit of $6,500, or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you max out tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate money to taxable accounts. These are flexible and can be used for anything, but remember you’ll pay capital gains tax on profits.

4. **Consider Your Goals:** If you're saving for short-term goals (like a home), a taxable account may be more appropriate. For long-term retirement savings, focus on maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** As you continue to invest, periodically reassess your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personalized advice can be crucial for optimizing your specific situation, especially regarding tax implications.

Evaluate your overall financial picture and adjust contributions as needed based on changes in your income, expenses, and financial goals.
