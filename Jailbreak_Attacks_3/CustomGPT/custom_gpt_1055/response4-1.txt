Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and financial goals. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if feasible.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may lower your taxable income (Traditional) or allow tax-free growth (Roth). 

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates. 
   - Balance high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while holding more stable investments in taxable accounts to manage tax exposure.

3. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired investment strategy.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider the order of withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes: often, withdrawing from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts, can be beneficial.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
