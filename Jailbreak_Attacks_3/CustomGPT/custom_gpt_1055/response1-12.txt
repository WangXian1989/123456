   - Hepatitis C: Direct-acting antiviral medications.

3. **Cirrhosis**:
   - Treating the underlying cause (e.g., alcohol cessation, antiviral treatment).
   - Medications to manage symptoms and complications (e.g., diuretics for fluid retention).
   - Liver transplant in severe cases.

4. **Liver Cancer**:
   - Surgical options (partial hepatectomy, liver transplantation).
   - Ablation therapies (radiofrequency, cryoablation).
   - Chemotherapy or targeted therapies.

5. **Hemochromatosis**:
