Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

### 2. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Utilize these accounts for growth-oriented investments (stocks, ETFs) since they grow tax-deferred (in the case of Traditional accounts) or tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on more conservative investments (bonds, dividend stocks) to minimize capital gains taxes and take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Assess your current and expected future tax brackets. Contributing to accounts that offer immediate tax deductions (like a Traditional 401(k) or IRA) is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all three account types to mitigate risks and benefit from various asset classes. 

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy as market conditions change.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement. Strategically withdrawing from accounts based on tax implications can help maximize your income.

### Summary:
- Prioritize employer matching in your 401(k).
- Contribute to an IRA for additional tax benefits.
- Use taxable accounts for investments that are less tax-efficient.

This distribution plan can help you maximize growth while managing your tax burden effectively as you progress toward retirement. Always consider consulting with a financial planner for tailored advice.
