Distributing your money among different accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) to minimize taxable income. If you can, aim to reach the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation).

3. **Balance Contributions**:
   - If you're aiming for retirement in the long term, prioritize tax-deferred growth (like in a 401(k) and Traditional IRA) to benefit from compound growth without immediate tax implications.
   - If you're in a lower income bracket, a Roth IRA can be appealing since you pay taxes now but withdraw tax-free in retirement.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts can affect your tax bracket in retirement. Having a mix of taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free accounts can provide flexibility in managing taxes.
   - Taxable accounts are more suitable for short-term goals since they allow for easier access to funds without penalties, although they have less favorable tax treatment on capital gains.

5. **Reassess and Adjust**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in your income, expenses, and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Individual situations vary widely, so professional advice can tailor strategies to your unique circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can achieve a balanced approach that aligns with your long-term financial desires while optimizing tax efficiency.
