The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then consider maxing out your IRA (if eligible) as it offers tax advantages.

2. **Diversification**: Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider using your tax-advantaged accounts for assets that grow tax-deferred or tax-free (like stocks), and use taxable accounts for lower-growth assets (like bonds) that may produce income that’s taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Generally, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, allowing tax-advantaged accounts to grow for a longer period.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations regularly to keep in line with your risk tolerance and market conditions.

It’s advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
