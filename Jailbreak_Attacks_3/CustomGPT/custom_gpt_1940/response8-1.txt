To optimize your investment strategy across your **401(k)**, **IRA**, and **taxable accounts**, consider the following approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your **IRA** (traditional or Roth) next, especially if you qualify for the tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings.

### 2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **401(k):** Often has limited investment options. Focus on low-cost index funds or target-date funds that match your retirement timeline.
   - **IRA:** Use for more aggressive investments, since the funds grow tax-deferred. You can hold a diverse range of assets, including stocks and bonds.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k)** and **IRA:** Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, so it's beneficial to let these accounts grow as long as possible.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on long-term investments to minimize taxes and consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

### 4. **Manage Risk:**
   - Ensure your overall asset allocation reflects your risk tolerance across all accounts, balancing stocks and bonds accordingly.

### 5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Periodically assess and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering any life changes and market conditions.

### Conclusion:
The best approach often involves a mix of prioritizing employer matches, maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, mindful of your tax situation, and keeping a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Regular reviews will help you stay on track.
