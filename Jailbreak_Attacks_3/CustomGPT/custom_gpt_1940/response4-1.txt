Distributing your money among a **401(k)**, **IRA**, and **taxable accounts** involves defining your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Retirement Goals**
   - **Time Horizon**: Consider when you plan to retire. The longer your time horizon, the more aggressively you might invest.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how you might withdraw funds in retirement, as this can influence your asset allocation now.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: 
     - **Employer Match**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
     - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, this is $22,500 or $30,000 if you're 50 or older.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - **Tax Considerations**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). 
     - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, this is $6,500 or $7,500 if you're 50 or older.

### 3. **Allocate Remaining Funds to Taxable Accounts**
   - Once youâ€™ve maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts. This may provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 4. **Consider Asset Allocation**
   - **Investment Strategy**: Depending on your risk tolerance, diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

### 5. **Be Mindful of Taxes**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and consider higher-turnover investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Annually**
   - Your financial situation and the market can change, so make it a habit to review your allocations at least once a year.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice tailored to your specific situation can be invaluable, especially when considering complex issues like tax implications and retirement needs.
