Distributing your money effectively among a **401(k)**, **IRA**, and **taxable accounts** requires considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach to help you strategize:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a **401(k) match**, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Focus on maximizing contributions to **tax-advantaged** accounts like a **401(k)** and **IRA** (Traditional or Roth) before putting significant amounts in taxable accounts. The **401(k)** and Traditional IRA are typically pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, a **Roth IRA** might be more advantageous. Conversely, if you’re currently in a high tax bracket, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) could yield immediate tax benefits.

4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund of about 3-6 months’ worth of expenses before heavily investing in any of these accounts. 

5. **Investment Diversification:**
   - Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment time horizon. Generally, younger investors can afford to take on more risk, while those closer to retirement should consider a more conservative approach.

6. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to tap into before retirement. These funds are accessible without penalties, making them suitable for near-term financial goals.

7. **Regular Review and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly review your allocations and rebalance your portfolio as needed. Life changes or shifts in goals might necessitate adjustments to your distribution strategy.

This structured approach can help you make the most out of your investments while considering tax implications and future financial needs. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
