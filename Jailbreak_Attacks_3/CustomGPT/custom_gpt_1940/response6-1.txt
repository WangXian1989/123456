To effectively distribute your money among your **401(k)**, **IRA**, and **taxable accounts**, consider the following strategic approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize any employer match first; itâ€™s essentially free money. For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a **Roth IRA** if you qualify, as contributions grow tax-free. The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50) for 2023.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional savings here for flexibility.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, mutual funds) since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your strategy, maintain a mix of aggressive growth investments in a Roth IRA and possibly more conservative options in a traditional IRA to manage future tax implications.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or index funds to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments longer to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 3. **Tax Implications**:
   - Withdrawals from a **401(k)** and **traditional IRA** are taxed as ordinary income. Prioritize these accounts for growth and defer taxes as long as possible.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that provide qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Adjust your allocations periodically based on market performance and your risk tolerance, ensuring that your asset allocation aligns with your goals.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency savings fund before focusing on investment contributions to avoid liquidating investments under duress.

By systematically prioritizing contributions and focusing on an appropriate asset allocation strategy, you can optimize your investments across all three account types for both growth and tax efficiency.
