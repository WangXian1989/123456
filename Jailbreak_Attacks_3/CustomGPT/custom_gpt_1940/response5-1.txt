Distributing your money among a **401(k)**, **IRA**, and **taxable accounts** depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a breakdown of considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: Prioritize contributing enough to your employer's plan to receive any matching contributions. This is essentially "free money." The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're over 50. Focus on maximizing this account first due to its tax-deferred growth and potential employer match.

2. **IRAs**: Consider opening a **Traditional IRA** or a **Roth IRA**. Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, whereas Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're over 50. Depending on your current income and tax bracket, choose one that aligns with your long-term tax strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in a taxable account for more flexibility. This account doesn’t have contribution limits, and you can withdraw funds without penalties. However, you will pay capital gains taxes on any profits, so be mindful of your investment choices.

**General Strategy**: 
- Maximize your 401(k) (especially to get any match).
- Contribute to an IRA (either type based on your tax expectations).
- Use your taxable account for additional savings and more liquidity. 

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this distribution strategy to your specific situation and adjust as your financial landscape changes.

**Key Considerations**:
- **Emergency fund**: Ensure you have savings set aside for emergencies.
- **Debt**: Consider paying down high-interest debt before investing more heavily.
- **Investment Strategy**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance and goals.

Ultimately, the distribution should reflect your individual circumstances, including your risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax considerations.
