The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal, usually in retirement.
   - **Investment Options**: Review the investment options available within your 401(k) plan, as they may vary widely.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxable withdrawals) and a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Your choice affects your tax situation and when you pay taxes on your money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you’re aware of annual contribution limits and how they impact your overall saving strategy.
   - **More Investment Choices**: IRAs typically offer a broader range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Cash in a taxable account is more accessible without penalties, making it a good option for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits made within these accounts. Consider tax-efficient investment strategies.
   - **Diversity in Investment**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate little taxable income (e.g., index funds) to reduce tax burden.

**Distribution Strategy**:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start by maximizing employer matches in your 401(k), followed by contributions to an IRA, especially if you can open a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
- **Balance**: After achieving employer match and IRA contributions, consider continuing to fund the 401(k) until maximizing annual limits if you are in your peak earning years.
- **Taxable Accounts for Extra Savings**: Use taxable accounts for funds that you might need sooner than retirement as well as for additional savings.

Finally, it is ideal to regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and life events. Consulting with a financial advisor may also provide tailored strategies specific to your situation.
