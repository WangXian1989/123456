(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The optimal distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax implications. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. For instance, contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any company match can be beneficial as it is essentially "free money." After that, consider funding your IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Lastly, any additional savings can be held in taxable accounts. This distribution strategy can help you balance tax efficiency and investment growth.
