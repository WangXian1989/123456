When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors should be taken into account, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Employer contributions (if available) can further amplify your savings.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 ($30,000 if you're age 50 or older), making it a primary vehicle for retirement savings.
   - **Investment Choices**: Check the options provided by your employer. If performance is strong and fees are low, prioritize contributions here, especially to capture any employer match.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Types of IRAs**: You can choose between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions but tax you upon withdrawal, whereas Roth IRAs tax contributions now and allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: As of 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older) across all IRAs. 
   - **Flexibility and Investment Choices**: IRAs typically offer a broader range of investment options than 401(k) plans. Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Investment Accounts:**
   - **Post-Tax Contributions**: Money invested in taxable accounts has already been taxed, allowing for more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.
   - **Tax Treatment**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held in taxable accounts. Using strategies like tax-loss harvesting can help mitigate these taxes.
   - **Accessibility**: Funds in a taxable account can be accessed at any time without penalties, which adds a layer of liquidity for personal needs or emergencies.

**Strategic Allocation:**
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching funds, as this is essentially free money.
- **Consider Tax Implications**: In a rising income environment, prioritize Roth IRAs for their tax-free growth and withdrawals. In lower income years, maximizing Traditional IRA contributions may yield better immediate tax benefits.
- **Diversification Across Accounts**: Maintain a diverse investment strategy across accounts. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets appropriate for your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
- **Revisit and Adjust**: Your asset allocation should not be static. Regularly review your accounts and adjust contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

Ultimately, your ideal distribution will depend upon your individual financial circumstances, investment preferences, and retirement goals. Consulting a financial advisor may also help tailor a strategy specific to your needs.
