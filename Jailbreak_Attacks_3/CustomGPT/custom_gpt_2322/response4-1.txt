Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a detailed breakdown of each account type and strategies for effective distribution:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to maximize that match. It’s essentially “free money.”
   - **Tax Deferral**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. This is beneficial if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment choices available in your 401(k) plan. If they offer lower-cost index funds or other profitable options, it may be a good place to allocate a significant amount of your investments.

2. **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Like a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, depending on your income and whether you have access to other retirement plans. This account is beneficial for tax deferral, and distributions are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, consider prioritizing contributions to a Roth IRA. This is particularly advantageous for younger investors or those in lower tax brackets now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts do not have the same restrictions as retirement accounts regarding withdrawals. Funds can be accessed at any time without penalties. This is useful for short-term goals or emergency funds.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be aware that any capital gains realized from investments in taxable accounts are subject to taxes. It might be prudent to keep income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes as long as possible.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Contributions to the 401(k)**: Ensure you get the full employer match and possibly max out your 401(k) limits if it aligns with your financial goals.
- **Contribute to a Roth IRA**: If your income allows, contribute to a Roth IRA to benefit from tax-free growth.
- **Allocate Funds in Taxable Accounts**: After contributing to retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for liquidity and investing in diverse opportunities, especially those that might not fit in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Example Distribution:
- If you have $10,000 to invest, you might allocate:
  - $5,000 to your 401(k) (to get the full employer match),
  - $3,000 to a Roth IRA,
  - $2,000 to a taxable account for flexibility.

### Annual Review:
Regularly review your asset allocations based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws. Adjust contributions based on performance and shifting circumstances to ensure you're on track to meet your retirement objectives.

By employing a strategy that emphasizes tax efficiency and aligns with your goals, you can effectively distribute your funds across these essential investment vehicles.
