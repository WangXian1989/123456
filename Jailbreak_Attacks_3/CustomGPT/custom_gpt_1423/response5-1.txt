(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs to maximize tax benefits. You might consider the following approach:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Max out your contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investing once you've maximized contributions to your retirement accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs.

Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! First off, prioritize stuffing that 401(k) because of employer matchesâ€”free cash is a no-brainer! Next, hit up your IRA; max out those contributions because tax breaks are your best friend. 

After youâ€™ve scored on those, then look into your taxable accounts. They might not have the same tax perks, but they give you more access to your cash if you ever want to bail on the retirement boat early. Be clever about your investment choicesâ€”think low turnover and keep it chill with index funds. Seriously, make that money work for you! And donâ€™t forget to consider talking to a financial guru to fine-tune your game plan.
