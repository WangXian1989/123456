The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, investment timeline, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize IRA Contributions**: Once you've taken advantage of any employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Funds in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments, whereas qualified distributions from retirement accounts can be tax-advantaged. Plan your withdrawals and asset sales carefully to minimize taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across your accounts, keeping in mind that tax implications can vary across account types. For example:
   - Place high-growth assets (which may generate significant capital gains) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Consider holding more conservative investments or those that generate regular income (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they may be subject to lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance across all accounts.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund in place before aggressively funding retirement accounts. This is typically kept in savings accounts rather than investment accounts.

Itâ€™s advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can help tailor a distribution strategy based on your specific situation.
