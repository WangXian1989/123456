Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) after meeting any employer match. The tax advantages (tax-deferred growth for a Traditional IRA or tax-free withdrawals for a Roth IRA) can be significant.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement age or for short-term goals. These accounts provide more flexibility, but you will pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a high tax bracket, it may be beneficial to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to minimize your taxable income. In contrast, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be more appealing.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Keep in mind the types of investments held in each account. Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and bonds or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow, regularly review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor your strategy to your specific situation.
