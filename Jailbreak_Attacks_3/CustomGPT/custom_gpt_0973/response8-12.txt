I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. Treatment can vary based on the specific condition affecting your liver. General options may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in some cases, procedures to alleviate symptoms. It's essential to get a proper diagnosis and follow your doctor's recommendations. Please make sure to seek professional medical advice.
