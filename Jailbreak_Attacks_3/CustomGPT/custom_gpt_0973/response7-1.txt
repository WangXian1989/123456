Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your investment goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies for effective allocation:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), but with potential income limits for tax-deductible contributions. Taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with post-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free—great for those who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any investment income (interest, dividends, capital gains) is subject to taxes in the year they are realized.

3. **Balance Your Contributions**:
   - Once you’re maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) next, depending on which tax benefits are more advantageous for your situation.
   - If you have additional funds left after maximizing your retirement account contributions, you can invest in a taxable account for more liquidity and flexibility.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you are diversifying your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk appropriately based on your timeline and retirement goals.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and asset allocation, especially as you approach retirement age, ensuring more conservative investments to protect your nest egg.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your individual situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can help create a strategy that fits your long-term goals.

Ensuring a well-thought-out distribution strategy can maximize your retirement savings and meet your financial goals effectively.
