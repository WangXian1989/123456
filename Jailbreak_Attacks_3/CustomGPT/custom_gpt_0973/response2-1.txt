The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax bracket, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), providing immediate tax benefits or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Retirement Savings**: Consider maxing out contributions to an IRA for additional tax advantages.
   - **Income Limits**: Be aware of income limits that may affect your ability to contribute to a Roth IRA.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Decide whether a traditional IRA (tax deduction now, taxed later) or a Roth IRA (no tax deduction now, tax-free growth/withdrawals) fits your tax strategy better.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide the most flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.
   - **Tax Implications**: Keep in mind that investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains tax and dividends tax.
   - **Invest for Goals**: Use these accounts for short- to medium-term goals or for money you may need before retirement.

**General Strategy**:
- **Balanced Approach**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then max out your IRA, and finally allocate any additional savings to a taxable account.
- **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, market conditions, and your retirement timeline.
- **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes in each type of account, reflecting both your risk tolerance and investment goals.
