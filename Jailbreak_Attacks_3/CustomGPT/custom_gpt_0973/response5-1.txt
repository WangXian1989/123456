(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, you may want to consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, it's often beneficial to contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits of IRA**: Depending on your income, a traditional IRA may offer tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Evaluate your current tax bracket and expected future tax rate.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties before retirement age, making them a good option for short-term goals or emergency funds.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments across these accounts are well-diversified to minimize risk and maximize potential returns.

5. **Review Regularly**: Review your asset allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your retirement goals and adjust as needed based on market performance and life changes.
