To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributing to your 401(k), especially if you're in a higher tax bracket, as contributions lower your taxable income. 
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, a Roth might be beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any excess savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. They're useful for short-term goals, and you can control when you realize capital gains.

3. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - *Risk Tolerance*: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, stocks are better suited for long-term accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA), while bonds or more stable investments can reside in taxable accounts.
   - *Asset Location*: Keep tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your investments and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Individual financial situations vary widely, so consider getting professional advice tailored to your personal circumstances.

This approach balances immediate tax benefits, long-term growth, and tax implications on withdrawals to optimize your financial strategy.
