Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before investing in other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Decide which is more beneficial for your tax strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible but subject to capital gains tax. They can be useful for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Investment Timeline**: For long-term growth, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA). For shorter-term needs, consider taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across these accounts to mitigate risk and maximize growth potential.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your investment strategy and asset allocation to align with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your individual circumstances.
