The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account that can cover 3-6 months of living expenses before investing.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Itâ€™s often wise to contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowed, especially if there's a company match. Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income level, consider maximizing contributions to an IRA (either Roth or Traditional). Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect your income to be higher in the future.
   
4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can distribute any additional funds into a taxable account. This provides liquidity and flexibility for short- to mid-term financial goals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across your accounts:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Consider holding higher-growth investments (like stocks) here to defer taxes on growth.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: You can place assets with the highest potential for growth since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Yearly Review**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation and contributions according to your changing financial situation and goals.

Ultimately, it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.
