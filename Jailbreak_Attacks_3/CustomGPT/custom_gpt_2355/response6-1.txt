Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to help you:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money. 
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Once you have maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can start to allocate funds to taxable accounts. This provides more liquidity and flexibility for early withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Consider Investment Strategy**:
   - Place higher growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (where gains are taxed later) and more conservative, income-generating investments in taxable accounts (to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains).

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Always review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary. Ensure that each account aligns with your overall investment strategy.

5. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - If unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy based on your unique circumstances and long-term financial plans.

This structure can vary based on individual situations, so adjust your contributions based on personal financial goals and circumstances.
