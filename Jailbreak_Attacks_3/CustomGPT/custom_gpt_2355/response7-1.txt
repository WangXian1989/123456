Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider for each account type:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it effectively provides free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Keep in mind that your contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income for the year. Itâ€™s wise to contribute to the maximum allowed.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Consider Tax Implications**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial, as withdrawals are tax-free. On the other hand, traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, giving you immediate tax benefits.
   - **Diversify Tax Exposure**: Having both a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA can provide tax flexibility in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility**: Taxable accounts are great for short-term goals or emergencies, as they allow easier access to funds without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Look for tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains tax. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### General Tips for Distribution:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in an easily accessible account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.
- **Age and Time Horizon**: The younger you are, the more risk you might take with your investments, as you have time to recover from market downturns.
- **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, diversify your investments to spread risk across various asset classes.
- **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations as your financial situation, goals, or market conditions change.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
