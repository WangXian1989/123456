I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest general treatment options for liver issues. It's important you consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Potential treatment options include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can improve liver health.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, certain medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying issues.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Regular tests to monitor liver function can help in managing any potential complications.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options such as a liver transplant may be considered.

5. **Supplements or Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore supplements, though you should discuss these with a doctor to avoid interactions.

Always seek guidance from a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
