Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Consider Tax-Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at a lower rate.
   - **Bonds in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Bonds can generate interest income that is taxed at ordinary income rates, making them more suitable for tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Assess Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**
   - **Long-Term Investments:** If you won’t need the money for several years, consider more aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep more liquid, conservative investments in your taxable account for easy access.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions among these accounts can enhance your investment strategy, optimize tax efficiency, and achieve your long-term financial goals. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
