To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Deferred Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit after taking advantage of the employer match. This allows for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Next, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts. Focus on low-turnover funds or tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across asset classes to mitigate risk while targeting your retirement goals.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically and adjust based on your financial goals, market conditions, and changes in your income or expenses.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies based on your financial situation and goals, consider working with a financial advisor.

This approach can optimize your savings, balance tax efficiency, and grow your wealth effectively over time.
