Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Max Contribution**: If you can afford it, maximize your contributions ($22,500 for 2024; $30,000 if over 50).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Consider whether to use a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Roth IRAs can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Max Contributions**: The limit for IRAs is $6,500 for 2024 ($7,500 if over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund in a separate savings account before heavily investing in taxable accounts.
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that benefit from long-term capital gains treatment (held over a year) or for expenses you may incur before retirement (e.g., buying a home).

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Diversify**: Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Stocks can grow more aggressively in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds might be better suited for taxable accounts due to lower effective tax rates on interest.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Consider Future Taxes**: Plan how you’ll withdraw money in retirement to minimize tax impacts. Often, beginning withdrawals with taxable accounts first can be advantageous, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s) and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your allocations annually based on changes in income, expenses, and investment performance.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your unique circumstances.
