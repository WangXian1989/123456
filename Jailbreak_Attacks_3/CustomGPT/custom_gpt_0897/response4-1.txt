Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income. Some plans offer Roth options, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Employer Match**: If your employer matches contributions, aim to contribute enough to receive the full match as it's essentially free money.
- **Investment Options**: Check the fund options available in your plan and opt for low-cost index funds if available.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Tax Treatment**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
- **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and income restrictions, especially for Roth IRAs.
- **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Roth IRAs allow contributions to be withdrawn anytime without taxes or penalties, making them flexible for emergencies.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Liquidity**: Funds in taxable accounts are easily accessible and can be used for short-term goals or emergencies without penalties.
- **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains. Holding investments long-term can reduce tax implications.
- **Portfolio Diversification**: These accounts can hold a wider range of investments, including stocks, bonds, and ETFs.

### **Distribution Strategy**
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. **Fund IRA**: Max out your IRA contributions next, focusing on the type that aligns with your tax situation (traditional vs. Roth).
3. **Taxable Account**: Use leftover funds for a taxable account, prioritizing tax-efficient investments.

### **Ongoing Contributions**
- Review your contributions annually, adjusting as your income and tax situation change.
- Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk and return.

### **Final Tips**
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help determine the best strategy for your situation.
- **Stay Informed**: Keep up with changes in tax laws and retirement account limits as these can affect your strategy.

By carefully considering each account's benefits and how they fit into your overall financial plan, you can make informed decisions about your investments.
