Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here’s a breakdown of how to approach it:

### General Principles

1. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Define your short-term and long-term financial goals. This includes retirement planning, purchasing a home, or educational expenses.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until you withdraw funds in retirement. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains. Consider placing high-growth investments here for more tax-efficient growth.

3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**:
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., 401(k): $22,500 for 2023; IRA: $6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if 50 or older).

4. **Consider Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.

### Distribution Strategy

1. **Prioritize Accounts**:
   - Start with your 401(k) up to the employer match, then contribute to an IRA, and finally to taxable accounts if you have extra funds to invest.

2. **Balance Investments**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for bonds and income-generating assets to reduce the immediate tax liability.
   - Invest in stocks and growth-focused assets within taxable accounts to benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates and defer taxes as long as possible.

3. **Regular Reevaluation**:
   - Periodically review your distribution strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing risk according to your age, risk tolerance, and investment timeline.

### Example Distribution

- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match, then focus on maximizing contributions.
- **IRA**: Open a traditional or Roth IRA and contribute the maximum allowable amount.
- **Taxable Account**: Use any remaining funds for strategic investments, focusing on long-term growth, and consider tax-efficient funds.

### Conclusion

The optimal distribution can vary based on personal circumstances, so consider consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your situation. Regularly reassess your investments as your financial situation changes.
