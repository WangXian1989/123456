Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the maximum match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If you can afford to save more after maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free.

### 3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**
   - Check the contribution limits for each account type (e.g., for 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 for those under 50) and adjust your contributions accordingly.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Funds in a 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth IRAs and taxable accounts have different tax treatments. Your current tax rate should inform your decisions.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to manage risk.

### 6. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Money in taxable accounts can be accessed anytime without penalties, making them suitable for short- to mid-term goals.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and changing market conditions.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that fits your individual needs and circumstances for optimal long-term growth.

### Summary
Begin with maximizing your 401(k) match, then consider IRA contributions, keeping in mind the tax implications and your individual financial goals. Diversification and regular rebalancing are key for maintaining your investment strategy.
