Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contribution Limits**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider funding an IRA (Roth or traditional) to diversify your tax benefits. The contribution limit for IRAs is lower than for 401(k)s.

### 2. **Assess Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: These allow for tax-free growth until withdrawal, making them ideal for long-term growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Contributions are made with after-tax money.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility and access to funds without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Allocation Strategy**
   - **Age-Based Allocation**: Younger investors might lean more into stocks in 401(k) and IRA for growth, while older investors might shift to bonds for stability.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate investments according to your risk tolerance across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 4. **Expense Ratios and Fees**
   - Choose low-cost investment options in your 401(k) and IRA to maximize returns over time. Research fund performance and fees in taxable accounts as well.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your evolving financial situation.

It's important to tailor these guidelines to your individual circumstances, potentially consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
