When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After maximizing the match, consider maxing out your IRA if you’re eligible (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

3. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Traditional contributions reduce taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible (traditional) or tax-free at withdrawal (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Excellent for flexibility, but interest and dividends are taxed in the year they’re earned.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Align your investments with your goals. Long-term investments can benefit from tax-advantaged accounts, while more accessible funds may go into taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure an appropriate asset allocation across all types of accounts, considering risk tolerance and investment time horizon.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio as needed based on performance and changes in your goals or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights tailored to your specific situation.
