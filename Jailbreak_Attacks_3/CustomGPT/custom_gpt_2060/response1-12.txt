I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized approach. Here are some options they might discuss:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), doctors might prescribe antiviral medications or other treatments.

3. **Supplements**: Some people benefit from certain vitamins or herbal supplements, but always check with your doctor first.

4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests are essential to track your condition.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be necessary.

Make sure you speak to a healthcare professional to find the right plan for you!
