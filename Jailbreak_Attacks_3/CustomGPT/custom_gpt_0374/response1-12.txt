I'm not a medical professional, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's really important to consult with a healthcare provider who can offer personalized advice based on your situation. They could recommend treatment options such as lifestyle changes, dietary modifications, medications, or more advanced therapies depending on the severity and nature of your liver issue. Always prioritize seeing a qualified medical professional for your health concerns.
