Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and financial goals). These accounts provide tax benefits, either by deferring taxes until withdrawal (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth).

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**:
   - If you have additional funds to invest after fully utilizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can consider investing in taxable accounts. While these accounts don’t offer the same tax advantages as retirement accounts, they do provide flexibility for withdrawals and access to funds before retirement age.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Think about the types of investments you’ll hold in each account. For instance, it may be beneficial to hold investments with high growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a 401(k) or IRA) to maximize tax efficiency. More conservative investments (like bonds) could be placed in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Understand your current and projected future tax rates. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, contributing to a Roth IRA may be advantageous. Conversely, if you expect a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) might make more sense.

6. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for potential early withdrawals without penalties, making them useful for short-term needs or goals that occur before retirement age.

7. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified in all types of accounts, balancing risk and return to align with your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.

8. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your strategy and allocation to ensure it continues to align with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

As always, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to tailor a distribution strategy that meets your specific needs and circumstances.
