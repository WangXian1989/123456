I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver issues. Treating liver problems can vary greatly depending on the specific condition, its severity, and individual health factors. Here are some general treatment options that may be considered for various liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Dietary Modifications**: A balanced diet low in fats, sugars, and sodium can help manage liver health. Foods high in antioxidants, such as fruits and vegetables, are beneficial.
   - **Regular Exercise**: Engaging in physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation, combat infections, or manage symptoms.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: 
   - If alcohol consumption has contributed to liver problems, abstaining from alcohol is crucial for recovery.

4. **Monitoring and Management of Underlying Conditions**: 
   - Managing conditions such as diabetes, high cholesterol, and obesity can significantly benefit liver health.

5. **Referral to a Specialist**: 
   - A hepatologist or gastroenterologist may offer specialized treatment options, especially for conditions like cirrhosis or liver cancer.

6. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - In severe cases where liver function is critically impaired, a liver transplant may be necessary.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare provider who can evaluate your specific situation and devise a tailored treatment plan for your liver problem.
