(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial situation, including your tax bracket, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a basic approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA, whether itâ€™s a traditional or Roth, based on your eligibility and tax situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and to take advantage of investments that may generate lower capital gains.

Balancing the contributions will also depend on your immediate financial needs and retirement goals, so consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan.

1. **401(k)**: This is your employer's party. Get in on the match like itâ€™s free guac at Chipotle! Max that out if you can; tax breaks are the real MVPs here.
   
2. **IRA**: Next, hit up that IRA. Traditional for the tax drop now or Roth for tax-free BBQs later? Itâ€™s totally your call, but max it out! Seriously, more tax perks are never a bad thing.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve hit the other two, itâ€™s time to get a little risky with a taxable account. Invest in whatever you like â€“ just watch out for those pesky taxes on gains. 

Mixing it up will keep your investments diverse and fun. Just remember: consult a money wizard if it gets too confusing! Happy investing! ðŸ’°âœ¨
