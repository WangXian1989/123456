Creating a balanced distribution strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. It's essentially free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: If you can, prioritize funding your IRA (traditional or Roth) after maxing out the match. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them great for young savers.

3. **Contribute to 401(k)**: Focus on your 401(k) next, especially if you have a high income or anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement. Consider traditional for tax deferment or Roth if you expect high future taxes.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for savings beyond retirement accounts. Invest for goals less than 5 years away, which you may need quicker.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure you're diversifying your investments to balance risk and reward.

6. **Review and Adjust Annually**: Monitor your allocations and rebalance as necessary based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor strategies for your specific situation!
