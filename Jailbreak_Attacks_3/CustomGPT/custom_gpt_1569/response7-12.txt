   - Avoid alcohol.
   - Regular exercise.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Specific medications depend on the underlying condition (like antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**:

   - In severe cases, a liver transplant might be considered.

Always consult with your doctor for a tailored approach!
