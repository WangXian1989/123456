To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth):**
     - *Traditional IRA:* Similar to a 401(k) in terms of tax benefits.
     - *Roth IRA:* Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Subject to capital gains taxes on earnings, but offer flexibility with withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match (if applicable).
   - **Fund Tax-Advantaged Accounts first:** Prioritize maxing out your IRA contributions next (Roth or Traditional based on your future tax expectations).
   - **Distribute Remaining Funds:** Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Considerations**
   - **Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place higher-growth assets (stocks, equity funds) in 401(k) and IRAs to defer taxes on those gains.
   - **Income-Generating Assets in Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding bonds or dividend stocks in taxable accounts to manage taxable income effectively.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - **Annual Review:** Regularly assess your asset allocation based on market performance and life changes.
   - **Adjust Contributions:** Increase or decrease contributions based on your investment goals and performance of each account type.

By strategically distributing your investments considering taxation, growth potential, and your retirement goals, you can optimize your financial future effectively.
