Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After funding your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, focusing on any after-tax contributions if your plan allows.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or when you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Consider holding investments in taxable accounts that have favorable tax treatments (like long-term capital gains).

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts. Some prefer to hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts (where they’re taxed at ordinary income rates) and stocks in taxable accounts (to take advantage of lower capital gains tax).

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your specific needs by seeking professional advice.

Consider these general principles, and adapt them based on your situation!
