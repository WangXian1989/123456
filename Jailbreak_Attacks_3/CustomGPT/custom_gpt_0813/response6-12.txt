I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver problems. Generally, treatment options may include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications like antiviral drugs or corticosteroids may be prescribed.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can support liver health.

It's crucial to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan from a medical professional.
