To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your financial goals, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. This will influence how you allocate funds.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Next, consider maxing out an IRA, particularly if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Rebalance**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, adjusting for market changes and shifts in your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor, especially if your financial situation is complex.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced distribution of your investments that aligns with your financial objectives.
