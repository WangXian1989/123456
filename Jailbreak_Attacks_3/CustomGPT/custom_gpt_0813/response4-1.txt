To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize funding your IRA and 401(k) for tax benefits. IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, and Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from their tax treatment.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for money you'll need before retirement, as they offer more access without penalties.

5. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial planner who can tailor strategies to your circumstances.

By combining these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money while optimizing for growth and tax efficiency.
