Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors: 

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Good for higher earners.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages but offer flexibility. Capital gains and dividends are taxed.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Decide your timeframe: short-term (taxable), medium-term (IRA), or long-term (401(k)).
   - Consider risk tolerance and target returns.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits ($22,500 for 401(k) in 2024, with $7,500 catch-up contributions if over 50).

4. **Employer Match**:
   - Max out any employer match in your 401(k) first. That's free money!

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify across accounts based on your risk profile. Consider balancing stock and bond allocations based on where you're investing.

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Think about how and when youâ€™ll access funds. This affects which account you prioritize.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.
