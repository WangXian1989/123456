Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to help you decide the best way to allocate your funds:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Typically offered by employers, these accounts allow you to save for retirement with pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income. Many employers also match contributions up to a certain percentage.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** These accounts can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (post-tax). Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are regular investment accounts with no tax advantages, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals and less stringent contribution limits.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize the 401(k) Match:** Start by contributing at least enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRAs:** If you can contribute more after securing the match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. The choice between the two depends on your current tax rate versus expected tax rate in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investing. This is useful for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Both grow tax-deferred, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are taxed upfront, but withdrawals (including earnings) in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You will pay capital gains taxes on profits, which can be managed through tax-loss harvesting and choosing tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Use each type of account to diversify your investments. For instance, you might choose stocks in a taxable account and bonds in tax-deferred accounts to balance risk and tax implications.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Your Situation**
   - **Age and Time Horizon:** Younger investors might prefer growth-oriented investments in taxable accounts while gradually moving to fixed assets closer to retirement.
   - **Income Level:** If you anticipate a lower tax bracket in retirement, traditional accounts may be more advantageous than Roth accounts.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full match, then aim to max out contributions if possible ($22,500 in 2024; $30,000 if over age 50).
2. **IRA:** Consider maxing out a Roth or traditional IRA (up to $6,500; $7,500 if over age 50).
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use remaining funds for taxable investments, focusing on long-term growth and tax-efficient assets.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
A financial advisor can help create a personalized distribution strategy based on your unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage your retirement savings and optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
