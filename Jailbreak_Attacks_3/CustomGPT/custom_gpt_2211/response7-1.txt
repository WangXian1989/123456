To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute the maximum limit to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal. Ideal for high-income years.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Great for those who expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Good for flexible, accessible funds without retirement restrictions, but subject to capital gains tax on profits.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Growth Investments**: Place higher-risk assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes on gains.
   - **Income Investments**: Consider putting lower-risk, income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Assess your portfolio allocations periodically and rebalance as needed to maintain your risk tolerance.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid, easily accessible account separate from your retirement savings.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can greatly improve your asset distribution strategy based on your unique financial situation and goals.

By balancing these considerations, you can create a distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals and tax situation.
