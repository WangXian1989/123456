Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: Max contribution is $22,500 (2023) if under 50; $30,000 if 50 or older.
   - **IRA**: Max contribution is $6,500 (2023) if under 50; $7,500 if 50 or older. 

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for additional savings after maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts. They provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Consider Investment Options**:
   - Choose investments that align with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Taxable accounts can hold taxable investments, while tax-advantaged accounts might benefit from growth-focused assets due to tax deferral.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodic adjustments ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Age 30**: 
  - 401(k): Max contribution for matching.
  - IRA: Contribute to a Roth IRA if income allows.
  - Taxable: Invest remaining savings.

- **Age 50**: 
  - 401(k): Increase contribution to max.
  - IRA: Contribute to both types if eligible.
  - Taxable: Reserve for future needs and investments.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
Consider professional advice for personalized strategies based on your unique situation, particularly regarding tax implications and retirement goals.
