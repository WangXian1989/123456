Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA or Roth IRA for their tax benefits. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **401(k)**: Focus on your 401(k) contributions next, especially if you're in a high tax bracket now.

### 3. **Balance in Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower turnover. Consider holding tax-efficient investments here.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) to reduce taxable income. If you're in a lower tax bracket or expect to be in the future, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Age and Retirement Goals**
   - Younger investors may want to prioritize accounts that offer higher growth potential (e.g., Roth accounts), while older investors might favor stability and income, balancing between tax-deferred and taxable accounts.

### 6. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - Regardless of account type, ensure your overall investment portfolio is well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and rebalance your investments periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation based on changes in market conditions and your financial goals.

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy to your unique circumstances. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to help structure your investment strategy based on your specific goals and financial situation.
