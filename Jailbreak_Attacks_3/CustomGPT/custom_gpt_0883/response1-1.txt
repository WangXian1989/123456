Distributing your money among different accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. If you're under 50, the limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50+).
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50+). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for funds you might need in the short to medium term. It's also beneficial for investments in assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Balance Risk and Liquidity**:
   - Allocate a portion of your money in stable investments like bonds or cash in your 401(k) and IRA. In your taxable accounts, you can be more aggressive since you can access the funds without penalties.

4. **Consider Your Age and Time Horizon**:
   - Younger individuals can afford to take more risks with higher equity allocations; those closer to retirement may want to shift towards more conservative investments.

5. **Regularly Rebalance**:
   - Monitor and adjust your distribution based on performance and changing financial goals.

Ultimately, it might be worth consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
