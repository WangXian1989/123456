I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice on liver problems. They may recommend various approaches, including:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Adopt a healthier diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins.
   - Limit alcohol consumption and avoid substances that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver issue, treatments might include antiviral medications for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and catch any potential complications early.

Be sure to discuss all options with a healthcare professional to determine whatâ€™s best for your situation.
