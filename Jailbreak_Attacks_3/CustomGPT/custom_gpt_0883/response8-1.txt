To optimally distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start with your 401(k). Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your employer match, focus on your IRA (Roth or Traditional). If you're eligible, consider Roth IRAs for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may not generate high taxable income (like index funds) and utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Inside each account, diversify your investments. In tax-advantaged accounts, you can focus on growth assets since withdrawals are taxed later (or not at all in the case of Roth IRAs). In taxable accounts, consider more income-generating investments that maximize tax efficiency, like municipal bonds or dividend stocks.

5. **Assess Withdrawal Strategies**: As you approach retirement, think about how you will withdraw funds. Having a mix of account types gives you flexibility and may help minimize taxes when withdrawn.

6. **Review Depending on Income Levels**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize the Roth contributions. If you expect a lower bracket, it may make sense to defer taxes in Traditional accounts now.

This balanced approach optimizes your tax situation and prepares you for retirement effectively. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
