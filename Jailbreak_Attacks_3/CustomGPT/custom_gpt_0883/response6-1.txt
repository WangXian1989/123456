When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize tax efficiency and growth:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for immediate tax advantages.

### 2. **Assess Contribution Limits and Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (plus a $7,500 catch-up for those over 50).
   - **IRA**: The annual limit is $6,500 (with a $1,000 catch-up for those over 50). Deductibility may depend on income levels and participation in other retirement plans.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investment opportunities after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on generating tax-efficient income through qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

### 3. **Investment Strategy by Account Type**
   - **401(k)**: Invest in growth-oriented assets, as taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Consider a balanced mix of stocks and bonds; align with your risk tolerance and withdrawal timeline.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds and ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Reassess your asset allocation regularly to ensure alignment with your long-term goals and risk tolerance. 

By strategically planning your distributions, you can maximize growth potential while managing tax liabilities effectively.
