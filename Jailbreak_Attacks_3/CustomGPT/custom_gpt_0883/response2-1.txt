To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax; consider maxing this out first, especially if there's employer matching.
   - **IRA:** With a traditional IRA, contributions are tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Decide based on your current vs. expected future tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for funds you may need before retirement or for capital gains. Be mindful of the tax implications on dividends and capital gains here.

### 2. **Investment Goals:**
   - Align your distribution with investment goalsâ€”long-term growth in your 401(k) and IRA, and potentially more liquid, shorter-term investments in your taxable account.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify within each account. Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for growth assets (like stocks) and more stable investments in taxable accounts (like bonds) to manage taxes.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for withdrawals based on which account will be most tax-efficient to tap into first in retirement.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Keep your portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance and investment objectives by regularly rebalancing across all accounts.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personal factors like age, income, and financial goals affect the best strategy. Tailored advice could optimize your strategy.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** 50% of your yearly contributions to maximize employer matches.
- **IRA:** 25% directed to a mix of traditional and Roth, depending on tax strategy.
- **Taxable Account:** 25% for flexibility and quicker access to funds.

This balanced approach maintains tax efficiency while supporting your long-term investment goals.
