Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax efficiency, investment goals, and your retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a simplified approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit first.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize any employer match. Consider the investment options available and fees.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments you may need access to before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from your investment accounts for unexpected expenses.

5. **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds) to balance risk and reward.

6. **Review Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your contributions and asset allocations based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.
