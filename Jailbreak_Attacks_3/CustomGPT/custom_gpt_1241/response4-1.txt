To optimize the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is free money. Aim to contribute the maximum limit if financially feasible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. This provides tax benefits either on contributions or withdrawals.

2. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates. Avoid holding high-turnover investments in taxable accounts since short-term capital gains are taxed at ordinary income rates.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where growth will not be taxed until withdrawal.
   - Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize tax impact. Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Rebalance Accordingly**:
   - Regularly review your overall asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial planner.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a balanced approach to managing your investments across different account types.
