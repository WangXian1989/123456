Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some considerations to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). If you're eligible, max out these contributions as well.

2. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. Interest and dividends are taxed in the year theyâ€™re earned, so invest in tax-efficient funds if possible.

3. **Determine Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k):** Typically limited to the investment options provided. Choose a mix of stocks and bonds that fits your risk profile.
   - **IRA:** Offers more flexibility in choosing individual stocks, ETFs, or other investments. Diversify based on your long-term goals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for flexible investments or strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

4. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline:**
   - If retirement is decades away, invest more heavily in growth assets (like stocks) across all account types. As you get closer, gradually shift toward more conservative investments (like bonds).

5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Always maintain an adequate emergency fund outside these investment accounts before allocating excess funds.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.
