Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to secure any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high contribution limits and an employer match, prioritize contributions here.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA or traditional IRA next, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are generally favorable for those expecting higher tax rates in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility since you can withdraw funds without penalties.

4. **Diversification Strategy**: Within each account, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk.

5. **Tax Implications**: Consider the tax implications of withdrawals:
   - **Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA)**: You'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth accounts**: Withdrawals are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Capital gains tax will apply, but you can offset some gains with losses.

6. **Financial Goals and Age**: Your age and retirement goals will dictate your risk tolerance. Younger individuals may lean more toward stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement may prefer stability through bonds.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your distribution strategy as your financial situation, goals, or market conditions change.

By strategically leveraging the benefits of each type of account, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your long-term financial objectives.
