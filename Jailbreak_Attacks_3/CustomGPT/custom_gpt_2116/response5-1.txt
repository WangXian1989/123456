Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):** 
   - Max out any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing up to the annual limit, especially if your tax bracket is high, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA:** 
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
   - Maximize contributions if your income allows, keeping in mind the income limits for Roth IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** 
   - Use these for investments needed before retirement, as they offer more flexibility.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds or assets to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Strategy:
- Prioritize 401(k) contributions up to the employer match, then contribute to an IRA.
- After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest additional funds in taxable accounts, focusing on long-term growth strategies and tax efficiency.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique financial situation.
