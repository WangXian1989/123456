Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maxing the employer match, contribute to your IRA (traditional or Roth) for its tax benefits, depending on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Return to 401(k)**: Once you've funded your IRA, go back to your 401(k) to maximize contributions, especially if it offers a diverse selection of funds.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for any additional investments. These allow for more flexibility, such as accessing funds without penalties and managing tax liabilities through capital gains.

5. **Consider Investment Goals**: If you're saving for retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts. If you have shorter-term goals (like buying a home), a taxable account may be more appropriate.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals, adjusting as necessary.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice considering your specific circumstances, consulting a financial advisor can be beneficial.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your investments efficiently.
