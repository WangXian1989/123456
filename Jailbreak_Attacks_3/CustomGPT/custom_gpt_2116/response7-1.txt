To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize your tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the maximum limit, especially if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a traditional IRA for immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts, focusing on:
   - Long-term capital gains investments (like stocks) to benefit from lower tax rates.
   - Tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to reduce taxable distributions.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to balance risk and return.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocations based on market performance and changing life circumstances (like retirement goals or income changes).

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation and goals.
