To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Start by maximizing employer contributions in your 401(k) if available, especially if there's a matching program.
   - Contribute the maximum limit to your IRA (both traditional and Roth, if applicable).

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax when selling investments. Use this account for short-term goals or investments that you can manage for tax efficiency.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Invest for growth in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) as they can compound without immediate tax implications. 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may produce more taxable income (like bonds) and low-turnover strategies to minimize taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts, considering risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically assess your contributions and investment performance. Adjust allocations based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Be Mindful of Withdrawals**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy in retirement to manage taxes efficiently, considering which account to withdraw from first based on tax implications.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 40% (focus on employer match)
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: 30%
- **Taxable Account**: 30%
