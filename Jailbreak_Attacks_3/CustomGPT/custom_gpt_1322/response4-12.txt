I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems can include lifestyle changes such as maintaining a healthy weight, following a balanced diet, engaging in regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol. Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or slow disease progression. In severe cases, medical procedures or surgery might be necessary. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
