Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to start.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are usually made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k) in terms of tax deferral. Consider this option if you’re looking for tax deductions now.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement. This can be advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t have the tax advantages of retirement accounts, but they offer more flexibility with withdrawals. Consider using these for funds you may need to access before retirement without penalty.

3. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across these accounts. Generally, you might want to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable account, while placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how you might withdraw funds in retirement. You generally want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA), and finally from Roth accounts as they can remain tax-free longer.

5. **Revisit and Adjust**: Review your allocations regularly and adjust based on changing circumstances, market performance, and life stages.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on detailed knowledge of your financial situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution is tailored to your individual needs and goals.
