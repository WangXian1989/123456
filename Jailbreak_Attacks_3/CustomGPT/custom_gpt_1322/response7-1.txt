To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to your IRA (either Roth or traditional, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals). IRAs often have more investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: For traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRAs), contributions lower your taxable income in the year you contribute. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA (where contributions are made after tax) might be more beneficial.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts provide more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes when selling investments.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside these investment accounts, typically 3-6 months' worth of living expenses.

6. **Diversification**: Diversify within each account type, including a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. 

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired investment strategy.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your individual circumstances.
