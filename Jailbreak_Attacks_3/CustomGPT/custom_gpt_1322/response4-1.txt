Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next (both Traditional and Roth IRAs, if eligible), as these accounts offer tax advantages depending on your situation.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k) plans (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older) and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older). 

3. **Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income for the year. However, you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA:** A Traditional IRA allows for pre-tax contributions, while a Roth IRA is funded with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains generated here are subject to taxes in the year they are realized. Consider this when deciding how much to place here.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts. This helps mitigate risk and can enhance overall returns.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it might be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Given the complexity and personal nature of financial planning, consulting with a financial advisor may help you craft a tailored strategy that fits your unique situation.

A balance of contributing to each type of account based on your immediate needs and long-term goals can help you optimize your savings and investment growth.
