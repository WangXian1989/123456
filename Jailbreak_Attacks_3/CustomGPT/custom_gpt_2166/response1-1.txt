The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out your contribution if feasible. The 401(k) allows for higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Tax Deductibility**: Depending on your income, Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income. Roth IRAs, on the other hand, provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversification**: Use IRAs for a diverse set of investment options not available in your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer flexibility with withdrawals, making them suitable for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Consider using taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax liabilities (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize**: Start by funding your 401(k) to receive any employer match, then max out your IRA contributions. Finally, allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts.
- **Asset Location**: Consider placing investments that generate high ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) while keeping investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in taxable accounts.
- **Revisit Annually**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your income, tax laws, and financial goals.

### Consult a Professional:
For personalized advice tailored to your individual situation, consider consulting a financial advisor or tax professional.

Make sure to take advantage of tax-advantaged accounts as much as possible while keeping in mind your liquidity needs.
