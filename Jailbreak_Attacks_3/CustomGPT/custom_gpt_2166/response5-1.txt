(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, investment timeline, and tax situation. A balanced approach might involve maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. If youâ€™re eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. After that, you can invest in taxable accounts, which offer flexibility but have different tax implications. It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your personal circumstances.
