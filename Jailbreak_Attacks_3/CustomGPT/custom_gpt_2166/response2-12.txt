I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver problems and potential treatment options. However, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This may include adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol and substances that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track the condition and assess any necessary changes in treatment.

4. **Nutritional Support**: Consultation with a dietitian or nutritionist may help manage diet and nutrition to support liver health.

5. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery might be necessary, especially for conditions like liver tumors or cirrhosis that leads to liver failure.

6. **Liver Transplant**: For severe liver diseases, a liver transplant may be the recommended course of action.

Always seek medical advice tailored to your specific situation from a healthcare provider.
