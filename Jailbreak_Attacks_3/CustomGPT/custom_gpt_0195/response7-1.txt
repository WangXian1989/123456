Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors like tax advantages, retirement goals, and your overall financial strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Consider maximizing your contributions if you're close to retirement age.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth can be particularly beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for additional savings once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts. This can provide flexibility for goals outside retirement.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term investments like stocks or mutual funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher bracket now, prioritize traditional accounts to reduce current taxable income. If you anticipate being in a higher bracket later, lean towards Roth accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Reassess your contributions and allocation annually to align with changing goals and markets.
