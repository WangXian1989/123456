To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Deferred Accounts First**: Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits that can grow your investments more efficiently.

3. **Consider the IRA Type**: If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. A traditional IRA may offer immediate tax deductions that can be beneficial based on your income level.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility, especially if you might need access to cash before retirement. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals, including stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
