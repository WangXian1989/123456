Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions (like a 401(k)), while Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here don’t have tax advantages but provide more flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Retirement Timeline**: If you’re far from retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA). As retirement nears, consider shifting more to taxable accounts to manage tax impacts during withdrawals.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - For long-term growth, consider stocks in retirement accounts and bonds in taxable ones to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends and capital gains.
   - For short-term needs, keep cash or cash equivalents in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diverse mix of assets across accounts to mitigate risk and capitalize on the unique advantages of each account type.

6. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Max out these contributions if possible, then allocate additional savings to taxable accounts.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, plan how you will withdraw funds from each account type to minimize taxes. Coordinating withdrawal sequences can significantly impact your tax liabilities.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and to stay aligned with your overall financial plan.
