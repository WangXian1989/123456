Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and age. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k) for contributions. You pay taxes on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, making it a great option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but you have more flexibility in withdrawals. Youâ€™ll pay capital gains taxes on profits, which can be lower than ordinary income tax rates.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily in retirement accounts, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of living expenses).

4. **Debt Management**: Pay down high-interest debts before maximizing contributions to retirement accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

6. **Age and Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you are younger and have time until retirement, a more aggressive portfolio in your 401(k) or IRA may be suitable.
   - As you approach retirement, consider shifting to more conservative investments to preserve capital.

7. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first before funding taxable accounts.

8. **Review Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation and adjust as necessary based on your financial goals, market conditions, and any changes in your situation.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, tailored to your individual circumstances. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
