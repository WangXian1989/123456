The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon for investments. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here can be subject to capital gains taxes, so it's often best to hold investments long-term to minimize tax implications.

3. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts:**
   - Spread your investments based on the account type. High-growth investments might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while lower-growth income-producing investments (like bonds) can be held in taxable accounts to manage taxes on dividends and interest.

4. **Assess Your Time Horizon:**
   - If you're closer to retirement, consider more conservative allocations. If you're younger, a more aggressive investment approach might be suitable.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically reassess and adjust your allocations based on your investment performance, changing goals, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A personalized approach might be necessary. A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your unique situation.

Make sure to review your accounts regularly and adjust based on your financial goals and life changes.
