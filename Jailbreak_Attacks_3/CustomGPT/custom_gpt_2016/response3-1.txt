Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax preferences. Traditional IRAs may provide current tax deductions, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
   - **401(k):** After maximizing your match, increase your contributions here. Contributions reduce your taxable income.

### 3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Shorter-Term Goals:**
   - If you expect to need funds before retirement, allocate some savings to taxable accounts. They offer more liquidity, although you may pay capital gains taxes on earnings.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in these accounts since they grow tax-deferred or tax-free. 
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold more tax-efficient investments here, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Tax Planning:**
   - Be mindful of your tax bracket when withdrawing funds in retirement. Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to manage your tax liability.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalance:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

By balancing your contributions between these accounts strategically, you can optimize growth while minimizing taxes. Consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized plan tailored to your situation.
