Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. If not, a traditional IRA may be more beneficial.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. Avoid holding high-turnover investments here.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across all accounts to mitigate risk. 

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when youâ€™ll withdraw from each account during retirement to optimize taxes. Typically, taxable accounts are tapped first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Revisit Annually**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and accounts to ensure they align with any changes in your financial situation or goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
