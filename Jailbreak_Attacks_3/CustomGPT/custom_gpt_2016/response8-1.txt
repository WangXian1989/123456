Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Contribute to a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here may be subject to capital gains taxes; consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

### 3. **Assess Your Investment Goals**
   - If you have a long-term horizon, consider a higher allocation in equities for growth in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For short-term goals (less than five years), keep more in cash or bonds in taxable accounts to avoid market volatility.

### 4. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**
   - Use a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts to maintain a balanced portfolio.
   - Keep tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Monitor and Rebalance Regularly**
   - Assess your portfolio periodically (annually or semi-annually) and adjust the allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 6. **Take Withdrawals Strategically**
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes: start with taxable accounts, then traditional accounts, and use Roth accounts last to allow the benefits of tax-free growth.

### Conclusion
It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation, especially considering changes in tax laws and personal financial circumstances.
