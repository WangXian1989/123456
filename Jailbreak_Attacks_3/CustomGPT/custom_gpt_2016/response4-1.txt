Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account, separate from your retirement accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maxing your tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts. This offers flexibility and liquidity, as there are no penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Generally, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, to minimize short-term capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes, considering which accounts to draw from first based on tax implications.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances for the best outcomes.
