To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k):** Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This can significantly enhance your retirement savings with “free” money.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Consider your tax situation:
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible, and you pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Use this if you expect your tax rate to increase in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds you may need before retirement or for short-term goals. Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Considerations:
- **Tax Efficiency:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first, saving taxable accounts for last.
- **Diversification:** Ensure that your portfolio is diversified across accounts to manage risk.
- **Goals and Time Horizon:** Consider your financial goals and the timeline for when you will need access to these funds.

### Suggested Contribution Order:
1. Max out employer match in 401(k).
2. Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible.
3. Max out 401(k) contributions.
4. Fund taxable accounts as needed for liquidity.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your individual financial situation.
