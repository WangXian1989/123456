Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if you can (for 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 or $30,000 if you’re over 50).
   - **IRA**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. The limit for 2023 is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re 50 or older). Choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) based on your tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should generally hold investments that generate low taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs. This is because you'll pay capital gains taxes when you sell the investments. Consider holding bonds or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your assets are diversified across different sectors and asset classes in all accounts. This helps manage risk and can improve your returns over time.

4. **Regularly Rebalance Your Portfolio**: Assess your portfolio at least once a year. Rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Have a Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, have a clear strategy for withdrawing funds from each account. This will involve considering tax implications and your longevity to minimize taxes and maximize your income.

6. **Stay Informed**: Keep up with changes in tax laws and contribution limits, as these can impact your distribution strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about your distribution strategy, consult with a financial advisor who can tailor a plan specific to your needs and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that aligns with your financial goals.
