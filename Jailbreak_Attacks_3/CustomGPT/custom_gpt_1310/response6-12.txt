I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general suggestions on liver health. It's crucial that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while avoiding excessive sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve overall liver function.

2. **Medical Treatments**:
   - **Medications**: Depending on your specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or slow disease progression.
   - **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging might be necessary to monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

Always seek professional guidance for managing any health issues.
