Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket. Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions (or if your employer doesn't offer a match), consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

3. **Choose Investments Wisely**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (such as stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) where capital gains won't be taxed until withdrawal.
   - Hold more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need before retirement or for specific short-term goals. Invest in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Tax Bracket**: If you're in a lower tax bracket now but expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, you might prefer a traditional IRA or 401(k).

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically assess your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

Make sure to consider your personal circumstances, including age, retirement goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline when making these decisions.
