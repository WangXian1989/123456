To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these tips:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If you can, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower capital gains tax rates, like index funds.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Keep a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to balance risk and return.

4. **Stay Flexible**:
   - Regularly reassess and adjust allocations based on your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

5. **Long-Term Focus**:
   - Think long-term for each account to align with your retirement goals.

6. **Use Tax-Loss Harvesting**: 
   - In taxable accounts, use losses to offset gains and reduce your tax bill.

Consulting a financial advisor can tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation. Happy investing! ðŸ“ˆ
