I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Generally, treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Improving diet (low-fat, high-fiber), avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), specific medications may be prescribed.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to track liver function.
4. **Supportive Care**: Managing symptoms and complications, which might involve treatments for associated conditions.

Always discuss your individual situation with a healthcare provider for tailored advice!
