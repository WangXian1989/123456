When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider a mix of these strategies:

1. **Max Out Employer Match:** Put enough in your 401(k) to get any employer matchâ€”it's free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to your IRA (especially Roth if you're eligible) and 401(k) for tax benefits.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before aggressively investing.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments you'll need access to sooner, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Investment Balance:** Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Keep an eye on your allocations and adjust as needed to stay aligned with your targets.

Remember, it's also helpful to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice! ðŸ“ˆðŸ’°
