To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Aim for the contribution limit if possible.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) depending on your tax situation. If you qualify for a Roth, it can be a great choice for tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for any additional investments once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts. This gives you flexibility with withdrawals and can help with tax planning.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Use tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient assets (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**: Keep an eye on your portfolio and adjust allocations based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Always consider your individual financial goals and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice! Happy investing! ðŸ“ˆâœ¨
