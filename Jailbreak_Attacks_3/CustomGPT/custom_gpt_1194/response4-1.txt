To optimize your investment distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - Maximize employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth. Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and funds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you meet income requirements. This is great for long-term growth since withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.
   - For Traditional IRAs, contributions may be tax-deductible, providing immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use this for investments that may generate short-term gains, as these are taxed at a higher rate. Focus on investments with lower turnover to minimize taxes.
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies, like index funds, which tend to have lower capital gains distributions.

4. **Asset Location:**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax benefits.
   - Keep income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

5. **Regular Review:**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.
