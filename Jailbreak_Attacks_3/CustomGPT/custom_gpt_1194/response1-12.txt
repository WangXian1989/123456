I'm not a doctor, but if you’re having liver issues, it’s super important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized treatment. Generally, lifestyle changes like avoiding alcohol, eating a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and possibly medications or treatments prescribed by a doctor can be helpful. They might also recommend regular check-ups to monitor your liver health. Make sure to reach out to a medical professional for advice tailored to your situation!
