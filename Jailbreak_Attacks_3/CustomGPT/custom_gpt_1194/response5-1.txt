(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, retirement goals, and tax situation. Generally, you might prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. 

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. It reduces your taxable income, and investments grow tax-deferred.
2. **IRA**: If eligible, max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may need to be accessed earlier or for holding funds that might be subject to capital gains taxes.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
