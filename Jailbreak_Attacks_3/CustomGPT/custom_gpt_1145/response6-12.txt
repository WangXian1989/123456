   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.
   - Avoiding alcohol and certain medications that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications:**
   - Antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids to reduce inflammation for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Treatment-specific Procedures:**
   - In some cases, procedures like endoscopy to manage complications (e.g., varices).
   - Liver transplant for severe liver disease or failure.

Always seek medical advice for a comprehensive evaluation and tailored treatment plan.
