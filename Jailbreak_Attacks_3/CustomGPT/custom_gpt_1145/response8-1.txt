When determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors such as your financial goals, current and future tax implications, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach to help guide your decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:** If your 401(k) plan offers employer matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income in the year you contribute. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but taxes are due upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement, provided certain conditions are met. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, but there are no early withdrawal penalties. You can utilize tax loss harvesting strategies here.

3. **Diversification and Investment Strategy:** 
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to maximize tax efficiency, while keeping more stable or income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund and Cash Flow Needs:** Ensure you have sufficient liquidity for emergencies. This might mean keeping a portion of your funds in taxable accounts, which are more easily accessible without penalties.

5. **Long-term Goals and Timing:** Your distribution strategy may vary depending on your age, how close you are to retirement, and your anticipated expenses in retirement.

In summary, a balanced approach might start with maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to get any employer match, contributing to an IRA (considering both traditional and Roth options), and then using any extra funds for taxable accounts. Regularly review your investment strategy and make adjustments as your situation changes.
