When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best approach typically depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** After capturing the employer match, consider maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like an IRA (Traditional or Roth) and your 401(k). These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly boost your savings.

3. **Asset Allocation:** Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, you may want to have a more aggressive asset allocation (more stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts since you won't be taxed on capital gains until withdrawal.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments that you want to access before retirement or for specific financial goals. Investments here are more liquid but you'll be responsible for capital gains taxes when you sell.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Once youâ€™re in retirement, plan your withdrawals strategically by considering the tax implications of withdrawing from each type of account. Often, it can be beneficial to draw down taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) or Traditional IRA, and leave Roth accounts for last to allow them to grow tax-free for as long as possible.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Given the complexities of tax laws and personal finance, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies and insights tailored to your specific situation.

Each individual's circumstances vary, so consider your own financial needs and goals while making these decisions.
