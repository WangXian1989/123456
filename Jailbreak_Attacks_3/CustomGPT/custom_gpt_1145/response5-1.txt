(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it is advisable to maximize your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first, as they provide potential tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.

Hereâ€™s a typical approach:
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Fund Your 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue to fund your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
4. **Use Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.
