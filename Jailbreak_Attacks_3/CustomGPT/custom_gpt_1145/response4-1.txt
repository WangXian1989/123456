Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts wisely depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maximizing your contributions to an IRA (Roth or traditional), as these accounts offer tax benefits that can aid in long-term growth.

2. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk. This can be achieved within each account type or across the accounts collectively.

3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Understand the tax implications of each account. For example, withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) and IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals can be tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes based on the investments held.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Consider how and when you will need to access your funds, especially as you near retirement. Having a strategy for withdrawals can optimize your tax situation and your overall retirement income.

5. **Risk Tolerance:**
   - Assess your comfort level with risk. Younger individuals might prefer a higher allocation in stocks via their 401(k) or IRA, while those closer to retirement might want to allocate more to bonds and safer investments.

6. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your target asset mix and to reflect any changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help you craft a strategy based on detailed analysis of your situation.

By taking these steps and considering your unique financial landscape, you can determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
