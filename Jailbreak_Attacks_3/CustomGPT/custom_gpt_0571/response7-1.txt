The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your age, income, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Generally:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get employer matching contributions up to the max. This is often the best immediate return on investment.
2. **IRA**: If eligible, fund your IRA next, especially a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts. This account is useful for liquidity and flexibility.

Consider a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your long-term goals. It's also wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
