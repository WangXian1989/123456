To optimize your investment distribution, consider the following:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer match, focus on tax-deferred growth.
2. **IRA**: Utilize for tax benefits, diversify investments.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use for more liquid, shorter-term goals or tax-efficient ETFs.

Balance risk and time horizon accordingly.
