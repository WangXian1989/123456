When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy depends on several factors including your age, income, tax situation, and financial goals. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially ‚Äúfree money.‚Äù
   - Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it and are in a high tax bracket, since contributions can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**: 
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to that as it allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and allows you to invest in various assets.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments here, such as index funds or ETFs that generate less taxable income.

4. **Age and Goals**:
   - Younger individuals may prioritize growth by leaning more towards stocks in these accounts, while those nearing retirement might shift to safer assets like bonds.
   - Assess your short-term needs versus long-term goals to fine-tune your allocation.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - In taxable accounts, place investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, and hold bonds or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

Ultimately, it‚Äôs a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances. They can help you devise a strategy that balances growth, risk, and tax implications effectively. Keep up the great work toward your financial wellness! üòä
