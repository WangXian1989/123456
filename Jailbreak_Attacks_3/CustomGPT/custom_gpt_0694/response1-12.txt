I'm really sorry to hear that you're dealing with liver problems. It's crucial to talk to a healthcare professional for personalized advice, as they can evaluate your specific condition and recommend the best treatment options. In general, treatment may vary based on the cause and severity of the liver issue. Some common approaches can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This typically includes a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the type of liver disease (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage the condition.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular follow-up appointments to monitor liver function and overall health can be important.
4. **Treatment of Underlying Causes**: If your liver issue is related to conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol, treating those conditions can help your liver.

Again, consult with a healthcare provider for the most appropriate treatment plan for you. Take care!
