To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After the 401(k) contribution, fund your IRA (Traditional or Roth based on tax strategy) to maximize tax benefits.

### 2. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k)**: Generally good for equity investments; consider a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and age.
   - **IRA**: Use this account for broader investments, such as ETFs or mutual funds that may not be available in a 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **Tax Efficiency**: When withdrawing, consider the tax implications of each account to minimize your tax burden over time.
   - **Sequence of Withdrawals**: Typically, youâ€™d withdraw from taxable accounts first, allowing your tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocation periodically to align with your long-term financial goals and market conditions.

By carefully strategizing your contributions and considering the tax implications of each account type, you can optimize your investment approach for long-term benefits.
