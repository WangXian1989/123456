### 2. **Focus on Issues that Matter**
   - **Highlight Relevant Policies**: Address issues like climate change, education, and social justice that resonate with younger voters.
   - **Incorporate Authentic Voices**: Use testimonials and stories from peers to make the causes relatable and urgent.

### 3. **Enhance Accessibility**
   - **Simplified Registration**: Streamline the voter registration process via mobile apps or online platforms.
   - **Provide Information**: Offer clear, jargon-free information about candidates and policies to help clarify choices.

### 4. **Encourage Community Involvement**
