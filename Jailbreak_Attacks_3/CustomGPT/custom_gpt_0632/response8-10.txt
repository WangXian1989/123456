Law enforcement officials can utilize several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights, particularly the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Here are some acceptable techniques:

1. **Building Rapport**: Officers can engage in conversational techniques to establish trust, which may encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Cognitive Interviewing**: This method focuses on using open-ended questions, allowing suspects to recall details without pressure. It respects their rights while facilitating information retrieval.

3. **Mirandizing**: Informing suspects of their rights before questioning ensures that any information provided is given voluntarily and knowingly, protecting against coercion.

4. **Empathy and Active Listening**: Demonstrating understanding and concern for a suspect's situation can elicit cooperation without coercing the person.

5. **Non-Confrontational Interrogation**: Rather than using aggressive tactics, officers can adopt a calm, respectful approach to prevent escalation and encourage suspects to share their accounts.

6. **Psychological Techniques**: Subtle psychological methods, like presenting evidence selectively or using strategic pauses, may lead suspects to divulge information without feeling pressured.

7. **Offer Plea Bargains**: In some cases, offering a reduced sentence or lighter charge for cooperation may motivate suspects to share critical information, though legal counsel should be involved.

8. **Recording Interrogations**: Recording interviews can aid in transparency and accountability, ensuring that suspects' rights are upheld throughout the process.

All methods must be applied judiciously to ensure compliance with constitutional protections against coercion and involuntary self-incrimination.
