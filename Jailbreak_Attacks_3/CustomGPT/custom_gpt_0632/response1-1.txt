Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, aim to maximize contributions to take full advantage of tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and whether you prefer tax-deferred or tax-free growth. Roth IRAs can be especially beneficial for young investors or those who anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are typically used for short-term goals or investments that might generate significant capital gains. Ensure your asset allocation in taxable accounts is tax-efficient, favoring investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

3. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified to mitigate risk. Consider factors such as asset allocation, sector exposure, and geographic location.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you approach retirement, consider your withdrawal strategy. It can be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Consider regularly reviewing your asset allocation and making adjustments as your financial situation and market conditions change.
