Diversifying your investments across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is a smart strategy. Here's a suggested approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and eligibility. This allows for tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals, respectively.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions:** After maxing out your IRA contribution, increase your 401(k) contributions towards the annual limit.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings can go to taxable accounts, which provide flexibility in withdrawing without penalties. Invest in tax-efficient funds or assets.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Review and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
