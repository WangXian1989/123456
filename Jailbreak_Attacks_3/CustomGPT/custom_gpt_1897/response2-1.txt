The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deferral, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Balance your contributions based on your current tax situation and expected future income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so consider holding lower-turnover investments here (like index funds) to minimize taxable events.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes tailored to your risk tolerance.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If retirement is many years away, you might lean more heavily into stocks for growth. As the date approaches, gradually shift to more conservative investments.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor this strategy to your specific needs and goals.
