Balancing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize tax efficiency and grow your wealth. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After obtaining the match, consider maxing out your IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). If eligible, aim for the annual contribution limit to leverage tax benefits.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: Next, consider increasing your 401(k) contributions to reach the annual limit, especially if your employer’s matching strategy is favorable.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest additional savings in taxable accounts. Focus on long-term investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Generally, consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

6. **Review Regularly**: Revisit your allocation periodically, especially after major life events, and adjust as needed.
