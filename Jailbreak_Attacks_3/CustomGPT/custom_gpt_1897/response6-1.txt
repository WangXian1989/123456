Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA. The choice depends on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Invest more in tax-efficient ETFs or index funds in taxable accounts. 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income, like municipal bonds.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure you maintain a balance of stocks, bonds, and cash across all accounts, tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your investment performance and make adjustments to maintain your target asset allocation.

### Conclusion
Focus on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts before investing heavily in taxable accounts, and prioritize investments based on their tax efficiency.
