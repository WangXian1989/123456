When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types and Their Benefits:**
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth. It’s ideal to contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages, such as tax-deductible contributions (Traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth IRA). Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While they don’t offer tax benefits like retirement accounts, they provide flexibility and liquidity for short-term needs or goals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - Max out any employer match in your 401(k) first since it's essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - After that, return to your 401(k) or contribute to a Traditional IRA based on your tax strategy.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax benefits.
   - Allocate more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-exempt bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.

### 4. **Match Investments to Goals:**
   - Use retirement accounts for long-term growth-oriented investments since funds grow tax-deferred.
   - Reserve taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or less aggressive investments.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor and adjust allocations as needed to stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### **Example Allocation Strategy:**
- **401(k)**: Maximize employer match
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the limit (especially if considering a Roth IRA)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional funds in a diversified portfolio that includes tax-efficient investments.

By considering these elements, you can create a balanced strategy that suits your financial situation and retirement goals. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
