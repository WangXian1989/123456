Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can optimize your tax strategy and investment growth. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions up to the match. Consider increasing contributions if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: If you’re eligible (traditional or Roth), aim to max this out next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may lower your taxable income now.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility. These can be used for short-term goals and provide liquidity without penalties.

4. **Investment Types**: 
   - Tax-efficient investments (like index funds) are better in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Holding bonds or high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts can also reduce tax burdens.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Your age, risk tolerance, and investment horizon should also guide how you distribute funds. Younger investors might lean more towards aggressive growth in stocks, while those closer to retirement may prefer stability.

6. **Regular Review**: Revisit your allocations periodically to adjust for changes in income, investment goals, and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation can also provide personalized guidance.
