Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute to your IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. Choose Roth if you expect higher taxes in retirement; otherwise, consider Traditional for immediate tax deductions.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for more access to your funds without penalties before retirement age. This can be beneficial for shorter-term goals.

### 4. **Consider Asset Allocation**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Periodically**
   - Assess your contributions annually and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

### Key Takeaways
- **Maximize employer match** in 401(k).
- **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts** for retirement.
- Use **taxable accounts** for shorter-term needs and flexibility.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal situation.
