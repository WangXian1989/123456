Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a breakdown of how you might approach this:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough** to get the full employer match. This is essentially “free money” and provides an immediate return on your investment.

### 2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**
   - If you have any high-interest debt (like credit cards), consider paying that off first. The interest on debt often exceeds potential investment gains.

### 3. **Max Out IRA Contributions**
   - After your 401(k) match, focus on maxing out your IRA. This can be a **Traditional or Roth IRA**, depending on your tax bracket and whether you want tax benefits now or in retirement.

### 4. **Back to 401(k)**
   - If you’ve maxed out your IRA, return to your 401(k) and consider contributing the maximum allowed. This typically offers tax-deferred growth.

### 5. **Diversify Taxable Accounts**
   - Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. Here, focus on **tax-efficient investments** like ETFs or index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - If retirement is far off, you can afford to take more risk with stock investments in all accounts. If you're closer to retirement, consider more stable investments.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Annually review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and goals.

### Summary:
- **Step 1:** Maximize 401(k) match.
- **Step 2:** Pay down high-interest debt.
- **Step 3:** Max out IRA contributions.
- **Step 4:** Contribute more to your 401(k).
- **Step 5:** Invest in a taxable account for additional savings.
- **Step 6:** Adjust based on your time horizon and rebalance annually.

### Conclusion
By following these steps, you can create a balanced, tax-efficient investment strategy that prepares you well for retirement. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation!
