When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, you may get tax deductions upfront (Traditional) or tax-free growth/withdrawals in retirement (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold, which can impact your overall returns.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your short-term vs. long-term goals. If you're investing for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For short-term goals, consider keeping money in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you’re maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, as they often have annual limits.
   - For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) (and more if you're over 50). IRAs allow up to $6,500 (with catch-up contributions available).

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Strategically allocate investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, higher-risk investments (stocks) can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments (bonds) may fit well in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Planning ahead for how and when you’ll withdraw can help optimize your tax situation in retirement. Understand required minimum distributions (RMDs) for tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.

### Summary

A well-balanced approach usually starts with maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA for tax benefits, while using taxable accounts for liquidity and shorter-term goals.
