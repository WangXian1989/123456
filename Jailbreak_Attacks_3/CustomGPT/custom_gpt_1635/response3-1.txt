To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Understand Your Goals**: Define short-term and long-term financial goals. Are you saving for retirement, a home, or education?

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deferred. Employer matches are a significant benefit.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income is taxed in the year it’s earned. Consider holding long-term investments to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough in liquid savings for emergencies before heavily investing.

4. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match.
   - Next, contribute to an IRA if you’re eligible for tax advantages.
   - Any remaining funds can go into taxable accounts for flexibility.

5. **Investment Allocation**:
   - Use your 401(k) for diversified funds and options that may not be available elsewhere.
   - Your IRA can focus on growth-oriented long-term investments.
   - Allocate more aggressive investments in taxable accounts if you have a longer time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically and adjust as needed to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial planner.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and effective strategy for distributing your money.
