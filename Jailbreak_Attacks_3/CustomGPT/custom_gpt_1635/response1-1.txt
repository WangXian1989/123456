Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some tips to help you allocate your funds effectively:

1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

2. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** These accounts often grow tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal. They’re great for long-term growth.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You’ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk. Consider the time horizon for each account.

4. **Consider Withdrawals:**
   - If you anticipate needing funds before retirement, keep more money in taxable accounts for easier access.

5. **Regularly Reassess:**
   - Review your strategy annually or whenever your financial situation changes. 

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
