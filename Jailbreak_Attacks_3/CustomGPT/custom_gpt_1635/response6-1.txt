To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits and Tax Benefits**  
   - **401(k)**: Take advantage of employer matching contributions; it’s essentially “free money.” Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: Consider whether to use a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth may be beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for investments you may need to access before retirement age without penalties.

### 2. **Prioritize Accounts for Long-term Growth**  
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first to maximize tax benefits.
   - **Invest in Tax-Efficient Funds in Taxable Accounts**: Look for index funds or ETFs that minimize capital gains distributions.

### 3. **Evaluate Asset Location**  
   - **Put High-Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Stocks, which are likely to grow significantly, should be in your 401(k) or IRA to shield them from taxes.
   - **Place Bond or Income-Producing Assets in Taxable Accounts**: Since these investments generate ordinary income, it’s often better to keep them in taxable accounts where you’ll pay lower capital gains taxes.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:  
- **401(k)**: 50% of your contributions  
- **IRA**: 30% of your contributions  
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20% of your contributions  

### Conclusion  
This balanced strategy can help minimize taxes while optimizing your investment growth based on when you'll need access to your funds. Regularly reassess your distribution strategy as your income, financial goals, and tax laws change. Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
