I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. General treatment options for liver issues often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can improve liver function.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplant might be necessary.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and tests to monitor liver function and address issues early.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.
