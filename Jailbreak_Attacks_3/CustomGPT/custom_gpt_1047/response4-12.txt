I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional as they can provide personalized advice based on your specific condition. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the diagnosis, severity of the issue, and overall health. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes such as diet modifications and exercise, medications to manage symptoms or underlying conditions, and in severe cases, liver surgery or transplant. Make sure to seek medical guidance for the most appropriate treatment for your situation.
