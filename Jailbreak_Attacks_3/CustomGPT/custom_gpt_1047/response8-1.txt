To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, if your employer offers a 401(k) matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider maxing out this account next. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Fund Your Traditional IRA**: If you have additional funds after maxing your 401(k) employer match and Roth IRA, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA. This account typically offers tax-deductible contributions, which can reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute.

4. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: Once the other accounts are set up, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This allows you to benefit from tax-deferred growth and lower current taxable income.

5. **Taxable Investment Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, start investing in taxable accounts. This is flexible for withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on any profits.

6. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Regardless of the type of account, ensure you have a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Typically, you may want to hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in your tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Periodically assess your financial situation and reallocations as necessary based on performance, changing goals, and market conditions.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, retirement goals, and tax implications. This comprehensive strategy should help you make the most of your retirement accounts and investments.
