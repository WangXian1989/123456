To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize your contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - If your plan has high fees or limited investment options, evaluate whether to direct additional savings elsewhere after achieving the match.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If youâ€™re eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income level and retirement strategy. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable investment accounts for funds that you may need to access before retirement or for short-term financial goals. These accounts offer flexibility and can be a good vehicle for investments that benefit from long-term capital gains tax treatment.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure your asset allocation across these accounts reflects your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and financial goals. Generally, you may want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where you won't pay taxes on dividends or capital gains until withdrawal.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - When it comes time to withdraw funds, plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize tax implications and to ensure your longevity of savings. Consider tax implications based on your expected income and tax bracket during retirement.

Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals. Consulting with a financial advisor may also provide personalized insights tailored to your specific circumstances.
