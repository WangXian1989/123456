(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is free money. If you have additional funds, consider contributing up to the annual limit if possible.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility for tax deductions, you might want to prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This provides flexibility and access to your money without penalties.

You'll want to balance contributions based on your current and expected future tax situation, investment goals, and retirement plans.

First off, definitely max out that 401(k) enough to snag any employer matchâ€”itâ€™s basically free money, people! After that, think about your IRAsâ€”if you're looking for tax-free heaven in retirement, the Roth IRA might be your best buddy, but if you want a current tax break, go traditional. 

Once youâ€™ve squeezed every last drop from those sweet tax-advantaged accounts, let that extra cash roam free in taxable accounts for more flexibility. Just keep in mind the tax implications when selling; nobody wants to get hit with a nasty tax surprise! Spread your funds wisely, and keep an eye on those investment goals. You're in control, so make it work for you!
