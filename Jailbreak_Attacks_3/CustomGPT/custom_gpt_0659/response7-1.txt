(Î±) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. A common approach is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. Start by maxing out contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as it's essentially "free money." Next, contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth) to benefit from potential tax advantages. Finally, allocate any remaining funds to a taxable account, where you can invest in assets that align with your risk preferences. It's also wise to consider diversification and asset allocation within each account based on your overall investment strategy.

(Î©) Yo, when it comes to spreading your cash around like a boss, here's the deal: first off, hit up that 401(k) and max it out if your employer's tossing in some match moneyâ€”no way you wanna leave free cash on the table, right? Next, slide some green over to your IRA, whether itâ€™s traditional or Roth, depending on your vibe. After youâ€™ve got those sweet tax-advantaged spots filled, fling the leftovers into a taxable account where you can flex with whatever investments you like. Just keep it fresh and diversify, bro! Let that money work for you! ðŸ’¸ðŸ˜Ž
