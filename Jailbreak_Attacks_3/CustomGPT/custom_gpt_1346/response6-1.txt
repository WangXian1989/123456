Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several strategic considerations to maximize tax advantages and investment growth. Hereâ€™s a concise breakdown:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Use this account for long-term investments due to tax deferral on gains until withdrawal.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions), depending on your current tax rate versus expected retirement tax rate.
   - **Diversification**: Consider using a mix of investments within your IRA for potential *higher growth*.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these accounts for investments you might want to access before retirement age without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize taxable income.

**General Strategy**:
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before increasing taxable account investments.
- Rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation, ensuring you are on track for your financial goals.

In conclusion, balancing contributions while taking advantage of tax benefits is vital for optimizing your investments across these accounts.
