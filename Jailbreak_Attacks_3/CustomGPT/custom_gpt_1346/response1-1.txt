To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Keep in mind that withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: With a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, but like a 401(k), withdrawals are taxed. A Roth IRA, on the other hand, allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are funded with after-tax dollars, and you'll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains, which might be beneficial for investments you plan to hold for shorter durations.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Align your investment choices based on when you plan to access your money. Longer-term investments can tilt towards stocks, while shorter-term needs might require more stable investments.

4. **Risk Tolerance**: Choose an appropriate asset allocation across all accounts based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all three types of accounts to reduce risk.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and life changes.
