The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon for retirement. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Max out employer-sponsored 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. A traditional IRA offers potential tax deductions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility with withdrawals, but be mindful of the tax implications on capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.), which can help manage risk.

5. **Tax efficiency**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Revisit and adjust**: Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in income, tax law, or financial goals.

It might also be helpful to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
