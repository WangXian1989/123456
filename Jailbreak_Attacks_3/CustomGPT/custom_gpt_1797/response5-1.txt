(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, retirement goals, and current tax situation. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) for additional tax benefits.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any excess savings, particularly for investments you might want to access before retirement.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

1. **401(k)**: First, throw in enough to snag that sweet employer matchâ€”think of it as free pizza at a party; why would you skip it? Aim to max it out if you can, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket now.

2. **IRA**: Next up, dip into an IRA (either Traditional or Roth). If youâ€™re young and can handle the tax hit later, go Rothâ€”your future self will thank you when those withdrawals are tax-free!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, graduate to taxable accounts: use them for anything above and beyond your retirement needs. Theyâ€™re great for flexibility and access!

In the end, balance is key! This isnâ€™t a one-size-fits-all deal, so tweaking it as you grow is a smart move. Always consider chatting with a pro to optimize this mix!
