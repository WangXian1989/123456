To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the limit if you receive a match. This lowers your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you’re eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs reduce current taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts. This offers more accessibility and flexibility for withdrawals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance:
   - Consider placing high-growth assets like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for less volatile investments, like bonds, where interest income can be taxed annually.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Future Taxes**: Think about your expected tax situation in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket, prioritizing Roth accounts could be beneficial.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring your distribution strategy based on your financial situation, goals, and tax implications can be complex, so professional advice may be valuable.

By following these principles, you can optimize your retirement savings strategy effectively.
