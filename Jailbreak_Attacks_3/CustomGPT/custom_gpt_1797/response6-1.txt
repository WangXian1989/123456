Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, making this a priority for tax savings.

### 2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**
   - **Consider a Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, contributing to a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Diversify Tax Exposure**: Balancing between a Traditional and Roth IRA can provide flexibility in managing taxes during retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or investments that may produce taxable gains or income.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on investments like index funds or tax-exempt bonds to minimize tax liability.

### Key Considerations
- **Retirement Timeline**: If retirement is far off, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Current Tax Bracket**: Determine if maximizing contributions to tax-deferred accounts or utilizing taxable accounts is more beneficial based on your current tax situation.

### Suggested Distribution Approach
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with the 401(k) to the employer match, then contribute to an IRA, and lastly allocate funds to taxable accounts.
- **Review and Adjust**: Regularly reassess your portfolio according to changes in income, tax laws, and personal circumstances.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor these ideas to your specific situation and optimize your investment strategy.
