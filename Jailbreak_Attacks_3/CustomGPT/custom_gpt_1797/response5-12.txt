I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems based on general knowledge. It's vital to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

### Common Treatment Options:
1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, quitting alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly impact liver health.
   
2. **Medications**: For conditions like Hepatitis, doctors may prescribe antiviral medications. For fatty liver disease, addressing underlying conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol is crucial.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests are essential to track the progression of the condition.

4. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases where liver function is critically impaired, a transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from vitamins or herbal supplements, but it's essential to discuss these options with a healthcare provider.

Make sure to consult with a healthcare provider for a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.
