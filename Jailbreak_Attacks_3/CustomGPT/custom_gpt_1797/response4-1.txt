To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.
   - Prioritize contributions to this account up to the limit allowed.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a traditional IRA might be more advantageous.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate regular income (like dividends) or for shorter-term goals, since they are subject to different tax treatments.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which may minimize capital gains distributions.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all account types, balancing between stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax implications when withdrawing funds from these accounts in retirement. Typically, it's wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your retirement goals and financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights based on your specific situation.
