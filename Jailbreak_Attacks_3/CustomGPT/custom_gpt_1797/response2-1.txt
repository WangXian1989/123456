Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Max out contributions to your IRA (if eligible) and your 401(k) before putting money into taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax treatment as a 401(k), while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding investments for a year or more to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Typically, stocks perform better long-term but come with higher risk. Bonds may offer more stability but lower returns.

5. **Age Considerations**: Younger investors may favor equities for growth, while those nearing retirement might shift to more conservative investments.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocation to ensure it aligns with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
