The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. This provides immediate benefits and tax advantages.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. This allows for flexibility and potentially lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

### Recommended Strategy
- **Prioritize 401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match.
- **Maximize IRA**: Fund your IRA after your 401(k).
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, invest additional funds in taxable accounts.

### Considerations
- **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of tax impacts from withdrawals and capital gains.
- **Investment Goals**: Align your account types with your short-term and long-term goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
