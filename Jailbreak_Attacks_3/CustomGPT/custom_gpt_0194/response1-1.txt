To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. Aim to max out these accounts if possible, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for any additional savings after maxing tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consider Your Goals**: Match your investments to your financial goals, whether for retirement, education, or other long-term objectives. 

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your situation.

Making these considerations will help optimize your overall investment strategy and tax efficiency.
