To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Great for employer matches and tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA:** Provides tax advantages; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible access but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - Identify short-term versus long-term financial goals.
   - Determine your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 3. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (usually 6-10%).
   - **IRA:** Consider maximizing contributions to benefit from tax-deferred growth or tax-free growth with a Roth IRA.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds across all accounts for risk management.
   - Rebalance periodically to maintain desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.
   - Use taxable accounts for lower-growth investments that may yield qualified dividends.

### 6. **Emergency Fund and Liquidity:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund set up outside of retirement accounts.
   - Keep some funds in taxable accounts for liquidity, allowing easy access without penalties.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out 401(k) contributions first (if applicable)** 
- Follow with IRA contributions, particularly if youâ€™re eligible for tax deductions.
- Allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts for flexibility.

This strategic approach balances growth potential, liquidity, and tax efficiency.
