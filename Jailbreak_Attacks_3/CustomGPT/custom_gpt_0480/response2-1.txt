Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k) First**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money" for your retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: 401(k) and traditional IRAs allow you to defer taxes on contributions and investment gains until withdrawal. These are typically best for higher earners who expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed in the year they are realized. These are more flexible for withdrawals and may be appropriate for shorter-term goals.

### 3. **Prioritize Roth Accounts if Eligible**
   - If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k). Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 4. **Emergency Fund Consideration**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid form (savings account or money market) before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### 5. **Diversify Across Account Types**
   - A mix of tax-deferred, tax-free, and taxable accounts can provide flexibility in retirement. This allows you to manage your tax liability strategically during retirement withdrawals.

### 6. **Adjust Based on Age and Retirement Timeline**
   - Younger individuals might prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions to grow tax-deferred investments. As retirement nears, consider shifting more towards taxable accounts for greater liquidity.

### 7. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**
   - Review your portfolio distribution annually or as your financial situation changes. Adjust your contributions based on performance, changing income levels, and life events.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your income (max out if possible).
- **IRA/Roth IRA**: 5-10% of your income (depending on eligibility).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings after maxing out the above accounts.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the best distribution strategy aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.
