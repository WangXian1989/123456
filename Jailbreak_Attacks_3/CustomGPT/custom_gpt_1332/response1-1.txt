Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current financial situation, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s, which can reduce your taxable income now and grow tax-deferred.

3. **Traditional vs. Roth IRAs**:
   - Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes on withdrawals) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals, contributions taxed). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth may be beneficial.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are often taxed at lower rates.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering asset allocation based on risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

7. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Keep an emergency fund outside of retirement accounts to avoid penalties for early withdrawals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure, consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for better growth and tax efficiency over time.
