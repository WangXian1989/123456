Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeframe. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. Assess Your Goals:
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 2. Maximize Employer Contributions:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 3. Consider Tax Advantages:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce taxable income; taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed annually; capital gains tax applies on profits from sales.

### 4. Diversify:
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on risk tolerance.

### 5. Ongoing Contributions:
   - After maximizing employer match in 401(k), consider maxing out IRA contributions, then return to the 401(k).

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 15% to 20% of your income (enough to get the match).
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible (for 2024, $6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any surplus that exceeds the above amounts.

### 6. Review Regularly:
   - Reassess your allocations annually to adjust for changes in income, goals, or market conditions.

### Conclusion:
Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.
