Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (if available). This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your tax situation (Traditional for tax-deferred growth; Roth for tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

### 2. **Allocate Remaining Funds to Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate higher taxable income (e.g., stocks or index funds) to take advantage of long-term capital gains rates.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you’re in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize tax-deferred accounts to lower your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, Roth accounts may be more beneficial.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are balanced and aligned with your risk tolerance.
   - **Asset Location**: Keep high-growth potential assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income (up to match limit)
- **IRA**: 10% of your income (max out contributions)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any remaining cash flow here based on your investment strategy

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.
