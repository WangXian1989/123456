Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
- **Tax Benefits:** Contributions lower your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you’re in a higher tax bracket now.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Tax Considerations:** 
  - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
  - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
- **Contribution Limits:** Be mindful of annual contribution limits and income restrictions for Roth IRAs.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility:** These accounts offer more flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.
- **Taxation on Gains:** Investment income and capital gains are taxed, so consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

### **General Strategy:**
1. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses set aside in a liquid form.
2. **Debt Management:** Pay off high-interest debt before investing heavily.
3. **401(k) Contributions:** Max out your contributions to at least the employer match.
4. **IRA Contributions:** Contribute to an IRA, prioritizing Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
5. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings and investments once retirement accounts are maximized.

### **Sample Distribution Approach:**
- **Aggressive Growth:** 60% in 401(k), 30% in IRA, 10% in taxable accounts.
- **Balanced Growth:** 40% in 401(k), 30% in IRA, 30% in taxable accounts.
- **Conservative Approach:** 30% in 401(k), 40% in IRA, 30% in taxable accounts.

Your specific allocation should be tailored to your circumstances, risk tolerance, and financial priorities. It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
