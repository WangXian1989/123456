The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Contribute to 401(k) Up to the Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide upfront tax benefits.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: After hitting IRA limits, increase your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit for additional tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you'll need sooner, as they offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals.

5. **Asset Allocation Considerations**: Place more aggressive, higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA) and hold more conservative investments in your taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and interest.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts. If you're investing for the long term, prioritize lower turnover investments.

7. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your changing financial situation and goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
