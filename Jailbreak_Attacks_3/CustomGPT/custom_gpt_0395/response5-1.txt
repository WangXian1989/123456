To effectively distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high income, prioritize this for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate high taxes (like stocks held for short-term), or for flexibility if you need to access the money before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments within these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon (e.g., stocks vs. bonds).

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice that takes into account your specific financial situation and goals.

This strategy helps ensure you're maximizing growth while managing tax implications effectively.
