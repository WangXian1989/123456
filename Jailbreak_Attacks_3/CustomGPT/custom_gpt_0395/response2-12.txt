1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Follow a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and fatty foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may be prescribed, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis or medications to manage conditions like fatty liver disease.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Supplementation**: In some cases, vitamins and supplements like vitamin E may be recommended, but consult your doctor first.

5. **Preventive Measures**: Vaccinations for hepatitis A and B can help prevent further liver issues.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, treatments such as liver transplantation may be necessary.
