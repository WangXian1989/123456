Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s. These accounts can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a readily accessible account before heavily investing. This fund should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are less tax-efficient. For example, consider investing in tax-exempt bonds or assets that generate long-term capital gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Stocks are typically riskier but can offer higher returns, while bonds are generally safer.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your portfolio and rebalance it to maintain your desired asset allocation based on changing market conditions and personal circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider talking to a financial advisor. They can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation.

This strategy should help you optimize your investments while aiming for your financial goals!
