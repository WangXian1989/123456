Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here are some key steps you could consider:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you are aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type (e.g., 401(k), IRA). For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older). For IRAs, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which may lower your taxable income in the contribution year. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax deductions for contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement since contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider the implications of capital gains taxes when investing in taxable accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before fully investing in retirement accounts. Many financial advisors recommend saving three to six months worth of living expenses.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across your accounts. Consider placing more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) since the tax implications of withdrawals can be higher for these accounts.

6. **Long-Term Strategies**:
   - Think about your long-term goals and how each account fits into your overall retirement strategy. You might prefer to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings while using taxable accounts for shorter-term goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor, especially if your financial situation is complex or if you have questions about investment choices and tax strategies.

By evaluating these factors and adjusting your contributions accordingly, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your financial objectives.
