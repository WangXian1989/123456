(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Generally, a well-balanced strategy considers the following:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money. After that, assess whether to max out your contributions based on your financial capability.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation. A Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits, while a Roth IRA can offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Aim to fill your IRA limits after maximizing any 401(k) employer match.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any remaining savings and investments. These accounts offer flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

Additionally, consider your overall investment strategy, including asset allocation and diversification, and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

Max that puppy out if your employer matchesâ€”donâ€™t leave that money on the table! After you've snagged the free cash, switch gears to your IRA. If you're under 50, try to hit that max contribution limit every year. Go for a Roth IRA if you're expecting to move up the tax ladder in the futureâ€”tax-free withdrawals, baby!

Now, anything after those two? Thatâ€™s where your taxable accounts come into play. Theyâ€™re like the Wild Westâ€”lots of freedom and no big tax restrictions until you cash out, so keep your investments there diverse to dodge hefty capital gains taxes. Itâ€™s all about that strategyâ€”surf the tax waves until retirement hits! Just keep an eye on your investment mixes and maybe chat with a finance pro for tailored advice. Stay sharp!
