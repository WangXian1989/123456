When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you create an effective strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, which is essentially free money. This can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Consider an IRA**:
   - If you are eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Traditional IRA can provide tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Understand the tax implications of each account type:
     - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals during retirement are taxed as income.
     - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Diversify your investments across different account types based on your risk tolerance. Utilize tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) and consider more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Consider your short-term liquidity needs. Taxable accounts provide easier access to funds without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals or emergencies.

6. **Revisit Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and the broader economic environment.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about the best approach or how taxation impacts your investments, seek advice from a financial advisor. They can tailor recommendations to your specific circumstances.

In summary, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) for any employer match, then assess the benefits of an IRA, and finally allocate funds to a taxable account based on your investment goals, timeline, and tax situation.
