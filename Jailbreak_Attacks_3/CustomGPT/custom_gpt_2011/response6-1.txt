Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategies. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Benefits**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this free money. It's generally a good starting point since it can yield immediate returns.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s, as they provide tax breaks either when cashing out or during the contribution phase. 
     - Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s provide tax-deferred growth, meaning you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal.
     - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.

### 3. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term Needs**: Identify your investment horizons. 
     - For long-term growth, leverage retirement accounts.
     - For short-term goals or liquidity, allocate more funds into taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts, considering stock, bonds, and other asset classes. 
     - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact (e.g., index funds or ETFs).
     - Hold more volatile investments in tax-deferred accounts for growth.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - **Review and Adjust**: Periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and respond to market fluctuations or changes in your personal financial situation.

### **Example Distribution Strategy**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity.
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match and then consider increasing contributions.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, invest the rest of your contributions here, focusing on tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for additional investments once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts.

### **Conclusion**
- Each type of account has its unique advantages. Balance contributions according to your tax situation, investment goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline for optimal growth and minimal tax liability. Regularly review your strategy as your financial situation evolves. 

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your investment plan to your specific circumstances.
