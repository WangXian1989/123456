Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your current financial situation, investment goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic approach to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Offered by employers, this account has high contribution limits and often includes matching contributions. Taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Typically offers tax-deductible contributions (Traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA). Contribution limits are lower than those for a 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts, but they offer flexibility in terms of access and investment choices.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, ensure you contribute at least enough to receive the full match before investing elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income today, which can be beneficial if you are currently in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Tax-Free Growth (Roth IRA)**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider prioritizing Roth IRA contributions for long-term tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments in these accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) to mitigate risk.

5. **Establish an Emergency Fund**: Before making significant investments, consider setting aside three to six months' worth of living expenses in a readily accessible account.

6. **Regularly Review Asset Allocation**: Your financial situation and market conditions can change. Regularly assess your asset allocation and rebalance your portfolio as needed.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure how to allocate your funds, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any additional savings, focusing on a mix of stocks and bonds for growth and income.

Make sure to stay informed about changes in contribution limits and tax laws that may affect your strategy.
