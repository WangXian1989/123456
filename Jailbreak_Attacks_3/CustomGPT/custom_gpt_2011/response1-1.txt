Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, consider contributing at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions to these accounts can reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement. Consider this if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. They offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investment choices.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts, ensuring diversification to manage risk.

4. **Assess Liquidity Needs**: Keep in mind that money in retirement accounts is less accessible without penalties until you reach retirement age. If you anticipate needing funds sooner, consider allocating more to taxable accounts.

5. **Age and Investment Horizon**: If you are younger, a higher risk tolerance might be appropriate, allowing for more aggressive investments. Consider your timeline for needing the funds to adjust your strategy accordingly.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to develop a tailored strategy based on your specific circumstances.
