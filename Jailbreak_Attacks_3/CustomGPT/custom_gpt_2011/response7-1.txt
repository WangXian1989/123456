Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially "free money" that can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth and potential tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice between these depends on your current tax bracket and expected future bracket.

3. **Prioritize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional money into a taxable brokerage account. This provides flexibility, as you can access your money without penalties, and you can manage your capital gains tax.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, consider your overall asset allocation strategy. Stocks might be more beneficial in tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) or IRA due to their higher growth potential and tax liabilities. In taxable accounts, you might want to hold more tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize taxes.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind the tax implications for each account. Taxable accounts will incur capital gains taxes when you sell investments, while tax-advantaged accounts offer tax deferral or tax-free growth. Therefore, holding more volatile assets in tax-advantaged accounts can be beneficial.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Continuously monitor your investment performance and asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals. Rebalance as needed based on changes in your finances or market conditions.

7. **Consider Future Withdrawals**: Think about how and when you plan to withdraw these funds in retirement. Having a strategy for withdrawal will influence how much you should keep in each account type.

Before making any major decisions, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your individual circumstances.
