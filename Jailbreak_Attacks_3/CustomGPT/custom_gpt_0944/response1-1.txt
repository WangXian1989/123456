Distributing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: Whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, contribute to take advantage of tax benefits. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should generally be used for investments that produce lower capital gains or qualify for lower taxes, like index funds or long-term holdings. This way, you minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Aim for a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts.

4. **Rebalance Annually**: 
   - Review your allocations and adjust as needed based on performance and your changing financial goals or risk tolerance.

5. **Take Withdrawals Strategically**:
   - In retirement, plan your withdrawals to minimize tax implicationsâ€”consider using taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
