Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is free money and a great way to start.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Continue to Fund 401(k)**: After reaching the match in your 401(k), consider increasing contributions to it until you reach the annual contribution limit.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can invest in taxable accounts. This offers more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on earnings.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Across all accounts, aim for a diversified portfolio that includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be strategic about where you hold certain types of investments. For example, place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains, while keeping income-producing assets in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: As your situation changes, regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to optimize your strategy.

It's important to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your individual circumstances.
