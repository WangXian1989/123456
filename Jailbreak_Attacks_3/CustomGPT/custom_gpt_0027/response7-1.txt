To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you meet income limits; it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) offer tax deductions now but are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - Taxable accounts are taxed on interest, dividends, and capital gains. Prioritize accounts based on your current and expected future tax brackets.

3. **Diversity of Investments:**
   - In tax-advantaged accounts, consider investments with more growth potential (like stocks), as these will benefit more from tax deferral.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments. Consider index funds or ETFs that incur lower capital gains taxes.

4. **Keep an Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you maintain liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies, while still funding retirement accounts.

5. **Revisit Regularly:**
   - Evaluate your contribution limits, account performance, and overall investment strategy annually, adjusting as necessary based on life changes and financial goals.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
