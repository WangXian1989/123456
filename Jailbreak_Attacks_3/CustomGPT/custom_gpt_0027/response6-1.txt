To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match; then, fund your IRA (traditional or Roth) based on income eligibility.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Utilize tax-deferred growth in these accounts to minimize taxes now.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Current vs. Future Tax Rates**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, prioritize Roth accounts (where contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals are tax-free).
   - **Withdrawals Planning**: Taxable accounts can offer more flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diverse Investment Strategies**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Maintain different strategies based on account type. For example, hold more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts and more conservative, income-generating assets in taxable accounts.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 4. **Know the Withdrawal Rules**
   - **Early Withdrawal Penalties**: Be aware of withdrawal limitations and taxes associated with each type of account.
   - **Retirement Timing**: Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement for tax efficiency.

### Summary
Balancing contributions among these accounts helps maximize your tax advantages and achieve your long-term financial goals. Tailor your approach based on your specific financial situation, investment goals, and tax outlook. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies can further optimize your plan.
