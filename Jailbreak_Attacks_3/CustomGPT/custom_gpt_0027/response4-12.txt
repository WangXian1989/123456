I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options for liver problems might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and progression of disease.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy, or even liver transplantation, may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: Certain vitamins (like vitamin E) and herbal supplements (like milk thistle) might be recommended, but always check with your doctor.

It's crucial to follow your healthcare provider's recommendations.
