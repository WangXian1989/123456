To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantage**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth; otherwise, a Traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

2. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings in a taxable account or other accessible savings for emergencies (3-6 months of expenses).

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Align your account choices with your financial goals. Long-term growth can favor riskier investments in retirement accounts, while more secure or liquid options may be suitable for taxable accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Keep more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts, and place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable account.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

7. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each type of account to optimize your tax advantages.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
