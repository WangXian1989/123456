It's important to balance your investment strategy based on your goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Maximize any employer match first, as it's essentially free money.
   - Choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance (younger investors may prefer higher stock allocations).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Traditional IRAs are beneficial if you want tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that may generate high taxable income (like bonds) or if you've maxed out retirement accounts.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Aggressive Risk Tolerance**: 60% in a 401(k), 30% in an IRA, 10% in taxable.
- **Moderate Risk Tolerance**: 40% in 401(k), 40% in IRA, 20% in taxable.
- **Conservative Risk Tolerance**: 25% in 401(k), 50% in IRA, 25% in taxable.

### Key Considerations:
- Regularly rebalance your portfolio.
- Monitor tax implications and adjust contributions as needed.
- Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation. 

Diversifying across these accounts can help manage risk and optimize tax benefits over time.
