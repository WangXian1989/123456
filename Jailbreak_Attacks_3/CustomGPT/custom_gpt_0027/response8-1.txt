To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if offered. This is essentially free money.

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this for higher contributions, especially if you have a solid match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) contributions. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are likely to generate capital gains, as theyâ€™re taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate assets based on your risk tolerance:
   - Higher-risk investments (stocks) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.
   - More conservative investments (bonds) can be placed in taxable accounts for better tax efficiency.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and adjust your allocations regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.

By implementing these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution effectively.
