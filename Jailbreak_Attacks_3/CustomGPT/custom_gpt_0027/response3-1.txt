Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you may need in the short to medium term. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds to minimize tax impact.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, higher-risk investments (like stocks) should be placed in accounts where capital gains are taxed least (like IRAs).

5. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of how taxes affect your investments in each account type, especially for taxable accounts.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% up to the match, then focus on other accounts.
- **IRA**: Max contribution if eligible (currently $6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Account**: Remainder of savings, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Summary
Regularly review your contributions and make adjustments based on your long-term goals and market conditions. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.
