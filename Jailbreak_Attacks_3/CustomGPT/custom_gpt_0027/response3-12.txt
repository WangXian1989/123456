I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while avoiding alcohol and saturated fats.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water to support liver function.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antivirals:** For viral hepatitis, medications can help reduce viral load.
   - **Immunosuppressants:** For autoimmune liver diseases to reduce inflammation.
   - **Liver Support Supplements:** Some vitamins and minerals may be beneficial; consult your doctor.

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, surgery may be necessary, such as in cases of liver tumors or to reduce pressure from cirrhosis.

5. **Liver Transplant:**
   - In cases of liver failure or severe liver disease, a transplant may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personal recommendations and to get a proper diagnosis.
