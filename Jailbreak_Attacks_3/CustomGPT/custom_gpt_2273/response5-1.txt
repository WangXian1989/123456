(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, itâ€™s a good idea to maximize tax-advantaged accounts first. If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before funding an IRA. After that, consider maxing out your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax preferences). Once youâ€™ve covered these options, you can allocate remaining funds to your taxable accounts for greater flexibility, as they allow you to access your funds without penalty and provide capital gains tax treatment on long-term investments.

First off, if you have a solid 401(k) match from your employer, throw as much cash into that bad boy as you can; that's free money you're leaving on the table if you don't! Next, if youâ€™re eligible for a Roth IRA (the sweet tax-free growth), go ahead and max that out too. Once you've topped off those tax-advantaged accounts, then it's time to get spicy with taxable accounts. With those, you can buy and sell as you please without the pesky early withdrawal penalties, making it the fun playground for investments. You gotta juggle it all based on your goals, but hitting those tax shelters first is key!
