When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s important to consider several factors including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional). IRAs can offer tax advantages and more investment options compared to 401(k) plans.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Traditional 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement, making it a great option if you expect to be in the same or a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are generally more flexible, allowing you to withdraw funds without penalties, though you will pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Invest for Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on gains. Interest or bond investments can go in taxable accounts since they typically generate ordinary income.

5. **Diversification of Accounts:** Having a mix of account types (tax-deferred, tax-free, and taxable) allows for flexible withdrawal strategies in retirement, which can help manage your tax bracket.

6. **Yearly Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type and adjust your contributions accordingly. As of 2023, the limits are:
   - **401(k):** $22,500 (+$7,500 catch-up if over 50)
   - **IRA:** $6,500 (+$1,000 catch-up if over 50)

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A professional can provide personalized advice based on your individual circumstances and help you create a balanced portfolio.

By considering these factors, you'll be able to create a strategy that maximizes your savings and aligns with your financial goals.
