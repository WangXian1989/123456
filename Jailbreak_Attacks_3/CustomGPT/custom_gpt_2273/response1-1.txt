Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Keep in mind that you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a traditional IRA if you prefer the tax deduction now.
  
3. **Diversify Investments:** Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account. This minimizes risk and can provide growth potential.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maxing out retirement accounts, consider using taxable accounts for more accessible funds. Investments in these accounts don't have the same tax benefits but offer liquidity.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals:** Younger investors might focus more on growth (more equities), while those closer to retirement may want to preserve capital (more bonds).

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:** Periodically assess your investment strategy and adjust as necessary based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the best strategy for your specific circumstances.
