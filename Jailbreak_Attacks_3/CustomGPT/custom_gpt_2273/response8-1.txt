When determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now but taxes your withdrawals in retirement. If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible (traditional IRA) or made with after-tax dollars (Roth IRA). Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed on dividends and capital gains. This is flexible but may incur higher taxes than retirement accounts.

2. **Investment Goals**: 
   - Consider your investment horizon. If you're saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts.
   - Diversifying your investments across these accounts can help manage risk.

3. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (with a $7,500 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older), while IRAs have a limit of $6,500 (with a $1,000 catch-up contribution).

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: 
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals may incur penalties if taken before 59½, while Roth IRAs allow for the withdrawal of contributions anytime without penalties. Taxable accounts offer the most flexibility for withdrawals.

5. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund separate from these accounts before investing.

6. **Risk Tolerance and Diversification**: 
   - Balance your investments in these accounts according to your risk tolerance and ensure you’re not overly concentrated in one asset class.

Ultimately, consider working with a financial advisor to craft a personalized strategy that aligns with your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance.
