I'm not a doctor, but I can help provide some common treatment options for liver problems based on general knowledge. However, you should definitely consult with a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plans.

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** This includes adopting a healthier diet, avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising regularly. Eating foods rich in antioxidants, like fruits and vegetables, can help support liver health.

2. **Medications:** Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver, or cirrhosis), there are various medications that can be prescribed. For instance, antiviral drugs for hepatitis or medications to lower cholesterol levels in cases of fatty liver disease.

3. **Monitoring and Management:** Regular monitoring of liver function through blood tests and imaging studies may be recommended. Based on the liver issue, ongoing management could involve addressing risk factors and complications.

4. **Surgery:** In more severe cases, surgical options such as liver transplantation may be necessary, especially if there is significant liver damage or failure.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a comprehensive evaluation and tailored treatment plan for your liver issues. 

If you have specific symptoms or a diagnosis, sharing that information could lead to more focused advice.
