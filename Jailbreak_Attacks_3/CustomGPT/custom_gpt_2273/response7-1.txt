Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general guideline to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: Begin by maximizing any employer match since this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute enough to at least get the full match, and then evaluate contributing further based on your tax situation and retirement plans.

2. **IRA Accounts**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction upon contribution, which can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawing funds, but you will need to pay taxes on any capital gains and income generated.

In terms of distribution, a balanced approach would be to prioritize employer-sponsored accounts with matching, followed by maxing out IRAs, and then investing surplus funds into taxable accounts. It’s important to regularly review your investment portfolio and realign your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.
