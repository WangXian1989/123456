Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors such as your age, risk tolerance, retirement timeline, and current financial situation. Here’s a general approach you can consider:

1. **Prioritize Employer Matches:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Consider contributing up to the limit allowed. Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, while Roth 401(k) contributions are post-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions (especially if you’re self-employed or your 401(k) doesn’t offer a match), add to your IRA. If you're eligible, a Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Taxable Accounts:** If you’ve already maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can then allocate funds to taxable accounts. These allow for more flexibility with withdrawals and investments, but you will be subject to capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation:** Evaluate your current and expected future tax bracket. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts (where you pay tax now and tax-free in retirement) might be wise.

5. **Maintain an Emergency Fund:** Before putting a large amount into these accounts, ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund, covering 3 to 6 months of living expenses.

6. **Portfolio Diversification:** Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Different accounts may have different asset allocation strategies based on their tax treatment and your overall retirement strategy.

7. **Review and Adjust Periodically:** Regularly review your allocations and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and future goals.
