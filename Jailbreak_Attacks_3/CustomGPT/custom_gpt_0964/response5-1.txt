(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, a recommended strategy is:

1. **Max Out Contributions**: Prioritize maximizing contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as this is essentially "free money".
2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) contribution, consider funding an IRA (either traditional or Roth) depending on your income and tax situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you are still looking to invest after maxing out retirement accounts, consider a taxable brokerage account for flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

Itâ€™s crucial to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing circumstances, including your risk tolerance and investment goals.
