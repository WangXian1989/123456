(Œ±) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to receive that match, as it is essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out contributions if you have the ability, as these funds grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your eligibility, contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA can be beneficial. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider balancing contributions based on your current tax bracket and expected retirement tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income, such as stocks or mutual funds. They are also useful for shorter-term goals or for investments that you plan to access before retirement age without penalty.

In summary, aim for a balanced approach that takes into account your time horizon, risk tolerance, and tax implications. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that suits your specific situation.
