Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) and IRA**: Maximize contributions to these tax-advantaged accounts first, especially if your employer offers a match. Focus on long-term growth investments.

2. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more liquid investments or short-term goals. Be mindful of capital gains taxesâ€”consider holding investments long-term to minimize these taxes.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Higher income might mean prioritizing tax-deferred accounts. Lower income may allow for taxable investments to take advantage of lower rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes and investment types.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

It's wise to consult a financial adviser for personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
