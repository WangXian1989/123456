To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, then consider maxing out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For short-term needs, utilize taxable accounts for more flexible access.

3. **Consider Taxes**:
   - Tax-advantaged accounts grow tax-deferred or tax-free, while taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes. Hold investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced investment strategy across all accounts to reduce risk.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Adjust contributions based on changes in your financial situation and investment performance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor the strategy to your specific needs.
