I'm not able to provide financial advice. However, consider these general strategies:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer match first, then contribute to the maximum limit if possible for tax advantages.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions, depending on your income level.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains, providing flexibility for withdrawals.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your individual needs.
