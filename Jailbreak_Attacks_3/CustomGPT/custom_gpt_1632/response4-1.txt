I canâ€™t provide specific financial advice, but I can give you some general considerations for distributing funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions for tax advantages, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate higher taxable income, like stocks or ETFs, which can be more tax-efficient.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications in each account type when planning withdrawals in retirement.

Consulting with a financial advisor could provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
