I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medical Treatment**:
   - **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).
   - **Supplements**: Some supplements may support liver health, but always consult a doctor before starting.

3. **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption can significantly benefit liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up appointments with a healthcare provider for regular liver function tests.

Make sure to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
