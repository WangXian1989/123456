Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, age, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Ideal for high contribution limits and tax deferral.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Consider funding if you're eligible; Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility in access to funds. Invest in tax-efficient assets, like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts, aligning with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your investments as needed to maintain your target allocation.

It’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
