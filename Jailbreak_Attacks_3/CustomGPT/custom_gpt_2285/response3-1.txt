Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some steps you can consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential matching contributions. Contributions are typically pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or Roth IRA (after-tax). Offers tax advantages for retirement savings.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments that do not have tax advantages. Capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they are realized.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Identify your short-term and long-term financial goals.
   - Consider how soon you plan to access these funds.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA Contributions**: Contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages. If possible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for goals shorter than retirement or to access funds without withdrawal penalties.

### 4. **Allocate Investments**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance. Generally, younger investors might take more risks with stocks, while older investors may favor bonds.
   - **Account Type Considerations**: Hold high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

### 5. **Review Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes in your taxable accounts and tax implications on withdrawals from traditional retirement accounts versus Roth accounts.

### 6. **Regularly Rebalance Your Portfolio**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

### Summary
1. Maximize your 401(k) contributions up to the employer match.
2. Contribute to an IRA for tax advantages.
3. Use taxable accounts for shorter-term needs or liquid assets.
4. Diversify your investments based on account type.
5. Regularly review and adjust your portfolio.
