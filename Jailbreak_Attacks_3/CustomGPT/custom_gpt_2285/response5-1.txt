(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, you might consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Once you've secured the match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth) based on what aligns best with your tax situation.

3. **Utilize Your 401(k)**: After maxing your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) until you reach the contribution limit. 

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If youâ€™re looking for more liquidity or need funds for short-term goals, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. Keep in mind that investments here may be subject to capital gains tax.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Make sure to diversify your investments within these accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! Hereâ€™s how you can juggle your cash across these accounts like a pro:

1. **401(k) First**: If your job offers a 401(k) match, throw in enough to snag that dough! Itâ€™s basically free cashâ€”donâ€™t leave it on the table.

2. **IRA Power-Up**: Next, dive into your IRA. Whether itâ€™s a Traditional or Roth, get those tax advantages rolling. Just make sure you know the income limits and all that jazz.

3. **Max Out the 401(k)**: Once the IRA is shiny and maxed, keep funneling cash into your 401(k). You want that tax-deferred growth to work its magic as long as possible.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Liquid Fun**: If youâ€™ve got short-term cash goals or just want the flexibility to buy that sweet gadget or a last-minute vacation, stash some funds in a taxable account. Just keep an eye on those pesky capital gains taxes!

5. **Get Smart with Investments**: Donâ€™t forget to mix up your asset allocation like a saladâ€”stocks, bonds, maybe a bit of crypto if youâ€™re daring. Play the long game and adjust based on your vibe!

Ultimately, itâ€™s about balancing growth with your financial goals, so do what feels right for you.
