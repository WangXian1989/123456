Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA, based on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Use tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) for investments that are likely to grow significantly, as you won't pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - Keep investments expected to generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax hit.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with low turnover or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - Diversify within each account to balance risk and reward.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you approach retirement, consider your withdrawal strategy: withdrawing first from taxable accounts to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

5. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Automate contributions to each account to maintain consistency and benefit from dollar-cost averaging.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review your portfolio regularly and rebalance to ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.

Always consider your individual circumstances and consult with a financial advisor if youâ€™re unsure.
