Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to receive the full match first; it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max Out Your IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs are great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, while traditional IRAs can reduce your current taxable income.
   - **Continue with 401(k)**: After your IRA, keep contributing to your 401(k) up to its limit, focusing on pre-tax contributions to reduce current taxable income.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, use a taxable account for investments. This can provide liquidity and flexibility for goals that are short to medium-term.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon, keeping in mind that tax-inefficient investments (like bonds and REITs) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations annually or after major life changes to ensure they align with your evolving goals.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
