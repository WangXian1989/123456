1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Adopt a healthy diet, focusing on balanced nutrition.
   - Limit alcohol intake and avoid smoking.
   - Maintain a healthy weight through exercise and diet. 

2. **Medications:**
   - Medications may be prescribed for specific liver conditions (e.g., antiviral medications for hepatitis).
   - Other drugs may help manage symptoms or complications.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups:**
   - Regular follow-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function.
   - Blood tests and imaging studies may be necessary to track progress.

4. **Procedures:**
   - In some cases, procedures like endoscopy might be required to address complications.
