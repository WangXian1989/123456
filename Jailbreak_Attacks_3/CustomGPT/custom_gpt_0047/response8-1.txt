Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Max out employer match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first; itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maximizing contributions, especially if your employer offers matching.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA for potential tax-free growth or immediate tax benefits.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses set aside in a liquid, easily accessible account.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility. Invest in low-turnover assets like index funds to manage tax implications.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Monitor your allocations regularly and adjust based on changes in your goals, risk tolerance, or market conditions.
