Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your specific financial situation, goals, and retirement timeline. Here’s a breakdown of strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are tax-deferred, lowering your taxable income in the year of contribution.
   - **IRA:** Consider whether a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA is best for you. Traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax deductions, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are subject to capital gains tax, but they offer greater flexibility for withdrawals.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Diversify investments across all accounts based on risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Typically, more aggressive investments can go in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for long-term growth.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan to withdraw from accounts tax-efficiently in retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and finally Roth IRAs if necessary.

### 5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly reassess and rebalance your portfolio based on performance, risk appetite, and changing goals.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** Max out contributions, especially if there’s a match.
- **IRA:** Contribute up to the limit, focusing on maximizing tax advantages.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for short-term goals or after reaching retirement account limits.

### Conclusion
Consult a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your unique circumstances. Regular monitoring and adjustments will keep your strategy aligned with your goals.
