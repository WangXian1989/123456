I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver treatment options. Treatment varies depending on the specific liver condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the diagnosis, medications may be prescribed to manage liver disease, including antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune conditions.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and liver function tests help track the condition's progress.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant or removal of lesions may be necessary.

5. **Supportive Care**: Dietary counseling and support for substance abuse treatment can also be crucial.

Consulting a healthcare professional is essential for tailored advice.
