Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the IRS limit, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

3. **IRA Contributions**: After maxing your 401(k) match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers tax deductions upfront.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out the above accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This offers flexibility for withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, equities are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to their higher growth potential and tax implications.

6. **Consider Tax Impact**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

7. **Revisit Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

It’s wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
