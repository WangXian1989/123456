Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may give you an immediate tax deduction.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Funds in 401(k) and Traditional IRAs grow tax-deferred, but taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - Withdrawals from Roth IRAs are tax-free in retirement. Taxable accounts will incur capital gains tax on profits when investments are sold.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate risks according to your timelines. Usually, it's advisable to have more equities in accounts meant for longer-term growth (like your 401(k) and IRA) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to reduce tax implications on short-term gains.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside these accounts. This fund should typically cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If uncertain, it might be beneficial to seek advice tailored to your specific situation from a financial planner. 

This approach can help in balancing growth potential with tax efficiency.
