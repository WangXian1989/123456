Iâ€™m not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help track liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Nutritional Support**: A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can aid liver health. In some cases, a specialist might recommend specific supplements.

5. **Treatment of Underlying Conditions**: Managing conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol can help reduce the strain on the liver.

6. **Invasive Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy, or even liver transplant, may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a personalized approach.
