Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket, since contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Factor in income limits for Roth IRA contributions and choose based on your tax strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that may need to be accessed before retirement.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Strategies to Consider:
- **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place bonds and other interest-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) or IRA) while keeping stocks in taxable accounts for long-term capital gains treatment.
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes.

### Professional Advice:
Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
