Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**

- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax.
- **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, which can be either Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts with no tax advantages, where capital gains and dividends are taxed.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.
  
2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deferral.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: After the match and IRA contributions, consider maximizing your 401(k) contributions. The tax deferral can significantly enhance growth.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**: Once retirement accounts are maxed out, invest in a taxable account. This flexibility allows for easier access to funds but involves capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**

- **Long-Term Investments**: Place investments with high growth potential (and thus higher capital gains) in tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Tax-Managed Investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or tax-efficient funds.

### 4. **Rebalance and Review**

- **Annual Review**: Assess your portfolio annually, adjusting for changes in income, goals, and market conditions.
- **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced mix of asset classes across all accounts.

### 5. **Consider Professional Advice**

If your situation is more complex, consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

Following these steps can help you develop a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy tailored to your financial goals.
