Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to traditional 401(k) and IRA accounts reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed. Evaluate your current and expected future tax rates to determine the best account type for your contributions.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have enough liquid savings outside of retirement accounts for emergencies, ideally 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for additional savings. Focus on tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, more aggressive investments are suited for accounts with longer time frames.

6. **Regular Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and make adjustments based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
