Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including tax implications, your retirement timeline, and your investment goals. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Max out employer-sponsored 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money. The contribution limit for 2024 is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Contribute to IRAs:** After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older). A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may give you a tax deduction now.

### 2. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k):** Generally, your 401(k) will have a limited set of investment options. Choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds that align with your retirement date.
   - **IRA:** A self-directed IRA often provides a wider range of investment choices. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets depending on your risk tolerance. If you choose a Roth IRA, focus on growth-oriented investments since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable accounts:** These should hold investments that generate little taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liability. Consider municipal bonds or growth stocks that allow you to defer capital gains.

### 3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Withdrawal strategy matters:** In retirement, consider which accounts to draw from first. Generally, it's wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.
   - **Location optimization:** Place investments with higher potential tax burdens (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and those with long-term growth potential (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover at least 3-6 months of living expenses.

### 5. **Regular Reviews:**
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation in each account and adjust contributions based on your overall financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Example Distribution Plan:
- Start with contributing enough to your 401(k) for the employer match, then max out your IRA, and finally allocate any remaining funds to your taxable accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice is also a prudent step, as they can tailor strategies to your specific circumstances and goals.
