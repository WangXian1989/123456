Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the match first. If you're able, consider reaching the annual contribution limit.
   - **Traditional IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA for tax deductions, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** If eligible, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, making it very attractive. 

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Funds invested here can be accessed without penalties, but you'll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains. It's usually wise to hold investments with high growth potential (which you intend to hold long-term) in these accounts to defer taxes as long as possible.

4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to spread out risk. Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Maintain a balance between stocks, bonds, and other assets. Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts when possible.

5. **Review and Adjust Annually:** Assess your investments periodically. Changes in income, life circumstances, and market conditions may require reevaluating your allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice aligned with your specific financial situation and goals.

This strategy aims to leverage tax advantages and optimize your investment growth over time.
