To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. For 2023, the maximum contribution is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50). Choose a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Traditional accounts provide tax deductions now but are taxed upon withdrawal. Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, beneficial if you anticipate higher taxes later.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets. The specific allocation depends on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - Remember that funds in taxable accounts are more flexible for withdrawals compared to retirement accounts, which may have penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Long-Term Growth Focus**:
   - Prioritize growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where you can defer or avoid taxes, and consider holding lower-growth or income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review your investment allocation regularly (at least annually) to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

By balancing contributions to these accounts based on your current financial situation and future goals, you can create a well-rounded investment strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your personal circumstances can also provide invaluable insights.
