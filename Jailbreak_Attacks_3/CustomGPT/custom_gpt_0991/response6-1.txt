Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s an effective strategy to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Aim to max out your contributions if eligible. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Consider Your Tax Situation
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use this for investments that are likely to generate taxable income, such as bonds or actively managed funds. This way, you can potentially lower your overall tax burden.

### 3. Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon
- **Long-Term Goals:** Prioritize retirement accounts for long-term growth to take advantage of compound interest.
- **Short-Term Needs:** Keep a portion in taxable accounts for liquidity if you might need access to funds before retirement.

### 4. Diversify Within Accounts
- Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts, investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### Summary
- **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts** (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings.
- **Use taxable accounts** for flexibility and liquidity.
- **Diversify** investments within each account type to spread risk effectively.
