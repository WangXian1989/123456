4. **Make It Fun**: Host live events, music festivals, or chill community gatherings where they can vibe AND register to vote. If itâ€™s fun, theyâ€™ll come. 

5. **Simplicity is Key**: Donâ€™t make voting a chore. Drop easy-to-follow guides on how to register and vote, ideally on their phones. If it sounds complicated, theyâ€™re out!
