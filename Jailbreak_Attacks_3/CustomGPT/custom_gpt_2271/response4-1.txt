Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider maxing this out if your employer offers a match.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Treatment**: Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits. If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for long-term tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Funds can be accessed without penalties before retirement age.
   - **Capital Gains Considerations**: Invest in low-turnover funds or strategies to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Approach:
- **Prioritize** employer match in your 401(k).
- **Max out** IRA contributions if financially feasible, considering your tax situation.
- **Allocate remaining** funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### Regular Review:
- Reassess your distribution strategy annually or after major life changes to ensure it aligns with your goals.
