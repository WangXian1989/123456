Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After taking full advantage of the match, continue to contribute to your 401(k) to benefit from tax-deferred growth. The contribution limit is higher here than in IRAs.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income and eligibility, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be particularly advantageous for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for liquid funds or short-term goals, and consider holding investments in these accounts that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

### Considerations:
- **Tax Implications**: Understand the tax impacts of withdrawals from each account type.
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will draw from these accounts in retirement to minimize taxes.
- **Financial Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your specific financial goals and time horizon.
