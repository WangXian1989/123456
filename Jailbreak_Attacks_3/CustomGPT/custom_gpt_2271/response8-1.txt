Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This offers flexibility for withdrawals and can provide capital gains tax benefits.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider keeping more aggressive, higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and holding more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize potential capital gains tax.

5. **Revisit Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.
