It's important to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized assessment, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit alcohol and avoid processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps manage weight and improve liver health.
   - **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water to help your liver function properly.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function through blood tests, imaging studies, and sometimes liver biopsies.

4. **Treating Underlying Conditions**: Managing conditions like diabetes, high cholesterol, or obesity can improve liver health.

5. **Supplements**: Some patients may benefit from liver-supporting supplements, but these should be discussed with a doctor.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as cirrhosis or liver cancer, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always discuss treatment options with a healthcare provider to determine the best course for your specific situation.
