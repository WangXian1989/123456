To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions for additional tax advantages.

### 2. **Diversify Contributions Based on Goals**
   - **Time Horizon**: Allocate more to growth-oriented investments in accounts with a longer time horizon (401(k), IRA) versus more stable investments in taxable accounts.
   - **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to sooner, maintaining liquidity.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor investments with favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains) and utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies.
   - **Retirement Accounts**: Prioritize tax-deferred growth in 401(k)s and IRAs, which can help compound your investments over time without immediate tax burdens.

### Additional Tips
- **Review Portfolio Regularly**: Make adjustments based on performance and tax implications.
- **Seek Professional Advice**: Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific financial situation and goals. 

By following these strategies, you can optimize your wealth accumulation while managing your tax liabilities effectively.
