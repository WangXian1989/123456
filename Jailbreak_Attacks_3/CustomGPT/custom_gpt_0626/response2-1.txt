To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maxing out any 401(k) match, consider funding a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and eligibility.

2. **High-Interest Debt**:
   - If you carry high-interest debt (e.g., credit cards), prioritize paying that down before heavily investing in any account.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment options, so choose a mix of stocks and bonds that aligns with your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Typically offers a wider range of investment choices. Consider using it for higher growth investments, particularly if it's a Roth IRA where withdrawals can be tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification and Liquidity**:
   - While contributing, maintain a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts. Ensure some investments are more liquid (easily sold without penalties) in your taxable account for any short-term needs.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow. Hold off tapping into tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and Traditional IRA) until necessary to minimize tax impact.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to max out the employer match.
- **IRA**: Fund up to the contribution limit (e.g., $6,500 per year or $7,500 for those over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can be split based on your overall financial goals and market outlook.
