Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider maximizing contributions to an IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can offer tax-free growth and withdrawals. Conversely, a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions in the contribution year, which might be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **401(k)**: After the employer match, if you can, contribute up to the annual limit in your 401(k) for further tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve already maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. This could be beneficial for liquidity and flexibility, though be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments within each account type. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - Different account types can serve different investment strategies. For instance, you might hold more aggressive investments in Roth accounts (where gains are tax-free) and more stable investments in taxable accounts (to mitigate tax impacts).

5. **Investment Strategy**: Tailor your investment strategy to align with your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline for needing the funds.

6. **Seek Professional Guidance**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice, especially if your financial situation is complex.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.
