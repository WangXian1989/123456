Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or investments that generate income, such as dividends or interest, since you'll pay capital gains taxes when you sell.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments among accounts. High-growth investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA), while more stable income-generating investments can go in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize tax impacts, considering which accounts to tap first.

Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your financial situation and goals.
