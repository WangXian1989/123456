For liver problems, treatment options vary based on the specific condition. Here are some common strategies:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid fatty, sugary, and highly processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight and improves liver health.
   - **Alcohol Limitation**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is critical for liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Medications**: For viral hepatitis, antiviral drugs may help manage the condition.
   - **Corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.
   - **Lactulose**: Used to treat hepatic encephalopathy by reducing ammonia levels.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or, in extreme cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.

5. **Management of Complications**:
   - Treatment for conditions related to liver issues, such as managing diabetes or hypertension.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized diagnosis and treatment options.
