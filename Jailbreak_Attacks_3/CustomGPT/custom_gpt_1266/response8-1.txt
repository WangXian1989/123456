To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Take full advantage of employer matching contributions. Aim to contribute enough to maximize this benefit.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account. This should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you've contributed to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexibility. This can be useful for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

4. **Investment Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and goals. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

5. **Rebalance Annually**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations at least once a year to ensure alignment with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, especially regarding tax implications, consult with a financial advisor.

This balanced approach can help maximize growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
