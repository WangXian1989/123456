Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including tax considerations, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a structured approach:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Max out your 401(k) contributions first, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for flexibility and access, especially after retirement.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align contributions based on short-term vs. long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term needs and retirement accounts for long-term savings.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk and return. Ensure you’re not overly concentrated in one area.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market trends and personal circumstances.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw funds during retirement to optimize tax efficiency.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your unique situation.
