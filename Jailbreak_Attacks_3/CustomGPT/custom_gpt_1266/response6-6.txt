2. **Addressing Relevant Issues**:
   - **Focus on Key Concerns**: Emphasize issues such as climate change, student debt, and social justice, which are crucial to younger demographics.
   - **Authenticity and Transparency**: Show genuine commitment to these issues through real stories, data, and engagement with grassroots organizations.
