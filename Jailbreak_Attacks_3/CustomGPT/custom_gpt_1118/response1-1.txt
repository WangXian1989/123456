Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here’s a breakdown of considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Contribution Limits:** As of 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500, with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're age 50 or older.
   - **Employer Match:** Always take full advantage of any employer match—it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are pre-tax (traditional 401(k)), reducing your taxable income now, or after-tax (Roth 401(k)), where withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.
   - **Investment Options:** Often limited to a selection of mutual funds and target-date funds determined by the plan.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
   - **Contribution Limits:** The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500, with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older. 
   - **Tax Deductions:** Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions based on income levels if you or your spouse aren't covered by a retirement plan at work.
   - **Roth IRA Considerations:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement if certain conditions are met. Income limits apply for contributions.
   - **Investment Flexibility:** Generally, IRAs offer a broader range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** No contribution limits, and you can access the money at any time without penalties, making this a flexible investment option.
   - **Tax Implications:** You will pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in the year they occur, which requires careful tax planning.
   - **Asset Location Strategy:** Consider placing tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) or IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max Out 401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match first to leverage free money.
2. **Max Out IRA:** Consider fully funding a Roth IRA if eligible, as the tax benefits can be significant.
3. **Max Out 401(k):** If possible, Continued contributions to your 401(k) can be beneficial afterwards until you reach the annual limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings can be directed towards taxable accounts for flexibility and potential growth.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you maintain a sufficient emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses outside of these investment accounts.
- **Debt Management:** Pay down high-interest debt before aggressively investing.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your allocation as your financial situation and the market change to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation for personalized guidance.
