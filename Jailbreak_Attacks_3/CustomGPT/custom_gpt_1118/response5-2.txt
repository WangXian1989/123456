Facial recognition can be implemented via cameras installed at entry and exit points, which automatically log attendance by recognizing employees' faces. Biometric data such as fingerprints or iris scans can also be used in conjunction with attendance systems to ensure accurate records. These systems can provide real-time data on who is present, manage clock-in/clock-out times, and potentially analyze movement patterns within the workplace. It's essential to ensure compliance with local laws regarding privacy and data protection, and to maintain transparency with employees about how their data will be used.
