First, it's essential to engage them on social media platforms where they spend their time, such as Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat. Creating visually appealing content that resonates with their values and interests is crucial. Collaborating with influencers who have strong followings among young audiences can amplify the message. Additionally, focusing on issues that matter to them, such as climate change, education, and social justice, can drive engagement. Providing easy-to-understand information on voting processes and simplifying the registration process also encourages participation.

Think TikTok dances for political messages or memes that nail their concerns about student debt and climate change. Influencers are your best allies; they can spread your message faster than you can say “social media campaign.” Don’t forget eye-catching visuals and a touch of humor! Create interactive content that invites them to share their thoughts. And for the love of all that’s good, make registration and voting as easy as scrolling through their feeds. If it feels fun and relevant, they’re way more likely to get involved!
