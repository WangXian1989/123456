When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - Maximize employer contributions: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - Consider your tax bracket: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this could be beneficial.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - Choose between Traditional and Roth IRAs: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current tax situation and future expectations, decide which is more advantageous.
   - Aim to maximize annual contributions within IRA limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use this for more flexible, short-term savings: Taxable accounts can provide liquidity and may be used for goals that are not retirement-related.
   - Be mindful of tax implications: Investments like stocks held for over a year are taxed at a lower capital gains rate compared to short-term investments.

### General Tips:
- **Diversification**: Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.
- **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust allocations as your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions change.
- **Financial Goals**: Align investment strategy with your financial goals, such as retirement age, lifestyle expectations, and other savings objectives.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
