When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. This is because they offer potential tax deductions or tax-deferred growth.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you have a high-income year or expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, contribute to your 401(k). Consider maxing out contributions if possible.

4. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income, you might prefer a Roth IRA (tax-free growth) or a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions). Both can provide tax benefits.

5. **Investing in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for money you might need in the short term or after retirement. Consider holding tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Consider Asset Location**: Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from deferred taxes, while holding income-generating or less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on age, risk tolerance, retirement goals, and changing tax laws.

It’s always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the approach to your specific situation and goals.
