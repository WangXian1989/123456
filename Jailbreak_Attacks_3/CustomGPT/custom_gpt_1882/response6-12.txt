I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver issues. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Emphasize a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol, sugar, and saturated fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track the progression of your condition and guide treatment.

4. **Supplements**: Some supplements may benefit liver health; however, discuss these with a healthcare provider to ensure they're appropriate for you.

Make sure to speak with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your needs.
