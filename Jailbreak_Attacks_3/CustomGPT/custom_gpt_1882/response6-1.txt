Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if possible, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to increase in retirement, or a traditional IRA for tax deductions in your current bracket.

### 2. **Balance with Taxable Accounts**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for savings goals with shorter time horizons since they offer flexibility without withdrawal penalties. Invest in tax-efficient assets like index funds or municipal bonds.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) in each account type to mitigate risks while aiming for growth.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawals & Tax Implications**
   - Plan for how and when you'll withdraw from each account to minimize tax liabilities during retirement.

### 5. **Regularly Review & Rebalance**
   - Adjust your allocations as your financial situation changes, ensuring that you stay aligned with your investment goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your unique circumstances.
