To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing this out next, especially if you have a high-income year, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility for a Roth or Traditional IRA, contribute here for additional tax benefits. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for immediate needs or short-term goals. These can provide liquidity and flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, ensure your investments are well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly assess and adjust your allocations in each account to align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

This balanced approach helps optimize tax efficiency and build wealth for your future.
