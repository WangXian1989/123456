Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general principles to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—that’s free money! Aim to maximize contributions up to the annual limit.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify. Roth accounts grow tax-free, which can be beneficial in retirement.

2. **Balance Your Investments**:
   - Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors might prefer more aggressive investments in stocks, while those closer to retirement may want stable, income-generating investments.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
   - Place higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize tax impact.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your total portfolio is diversified across asset classes, industries, and geographies to manage risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk exposure.

It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
