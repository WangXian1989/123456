Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). IRAs can offer tax deductions or tax-free growth.

3. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). The IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

4. **Allocate Remaining Funds to Taxable Accounts**: If you have extra funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, place those in taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility without early withdrawal penalties.

5. **Consider Withdrawals and Investments**: Think about how and when you may need to withdraw funds. Taxable accounts can provide quicker access without penalties. 

6. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate investments based on the account type:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth, as you can’t access the money easily without penalties.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Roth or Traditional, consider tax implications for withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use a mix of investments, keeping in mind capital gains tax and dividends.

7. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations annually or when your financial situation changes.

This strategy helps balance growth, tax efficiency, and liquidity.
