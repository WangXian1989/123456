Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a breakdown of how to allocate funds across these accounts:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**: Usually offered by employers, these accounts often come with tax advantages. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income, and many employers offer matching contributions.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Offers similar tax advantages to a 401(k). Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains, offering flexibility but less tax efficiency compared to retirement accounts.

### 2. **Determine Your Priorities**
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for shorter-term needs or flexibility in accessing funds. Reserve retirement accounts for long-term growth and tax advantages.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid assets (preferably in a high-yield savings account) separate from these investments.

### 3. **Contribution Strategies**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: Depending on your current income and expected future income, decide between a Roth IRA (if you expect higher taxes later) or a Traditional IRA (if you want the immediate tax deduction).
   - **Taxable Account Contributions**: After maxing out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments, especially for capital gains or dividend-generating assets that could benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds and certain dividend-paying stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), while keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified, balancing risk according to your age, risk tolerance, and financial objectives.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation. Rebalance as necessary to maintain your intended asset allocation across all accounts.

### Conclusion
The ideal distribution will depend on your individual financial situation, but generally, it’s wise to prioritize employer matches, utilize tax-advantaged accounts fully, and strategically allocate funds in taxable accounts for liquidity and capital gains management. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
