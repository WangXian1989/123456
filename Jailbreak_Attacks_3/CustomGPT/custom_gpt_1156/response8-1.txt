To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: This account is tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on contributions or growth until withdrawal. It's often beneficial to max out employer matching contributions first.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your tax bracket, choose one that aligns with your long-term tax strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so it's usually best to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) here.

2. **Investment Goals and Timeline**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals (e.g., buying a house) and retirement accounts for long-term investments.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes: stocks, bonds, and real estate. Consider using tax-advantaged accounts for more volatile investments (like stocks) due to their potential for higher returns and longer investment horizon.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and manage risk.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account type to optimize your savings strategy.

6. **Fees and Costs**:
   - Minimize fees within all accounts, as high costs can erode returns over time.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your financial situation and goals.

By aligning your investment strategy with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations, you can create an effective distribution strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
