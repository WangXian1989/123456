Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement account with tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages but has contribution limits; can be a Traditional or Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible investment accounts that don’t have tax advantages but provide liquidity.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA for potential tax advantages.
   - **Contribute Additional to 401(k):** Once you've hit the match, consider contributing more to your 401(k).
   - **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Use these for any additional savings or investments, focusing on short- to medium-term goals.

### 3. **Investment Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance. Younger investors might lean towards stocks in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - **Review Annually:** Regularly assess your investment performance and reallocate based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawing from these accounts, especially if you're nearing retirement.

This strategy promotes a balanced approach while maximizing tax advantages and potential returns.
