Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a balanced approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.” The 2023 contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth). The 2023 limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50). Roth IRAs, in particular, can be beneficial as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth account may make sense. Conversely, if you think your tax rate will decrease, traditional accounts could be advantageous.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. 

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Distribute your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Portfolio Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocation to maintain your desired balance between risk and return.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have liquid cash in a savings account separate from your investments to cover 3-6 months of living expenses. This helps avoid dipping into retirement accounts prematurely.

### 5. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - Think about when you will need to access the funds. Taxable accounts are more flexible for withdrawals, while retirement accounts have penalties for early withdrawal.

### Conclusion
A typical strategy might involve maxing out employer match in your 401(k), then contributing to an IRA, and finally investing in taxable accounts for flexibility. Adjust based on personal circumstances and consult a financial advisor for tailored advice.
