When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often tax-deferred, leading to tax savings now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement after meeting certain conditions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment earnings are subject to capital gains tax, which is typically lower than ordinary income tax rates. However, dividends and interest are taxed as ordinary income.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions Based on Employer Match**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** Start by contributing enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribute to IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth.

### 3. **Balance for Flexibility and Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account for greater withdrawal flexibility.
   - **Diversify Investments:** Aim for a mix of equities, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to optimize growth potential. 

### 4. **Reassess Periodically**
   - **Rebalance Investments:** Regularly review and adjust your portfolio based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting:** Consider this strategy in taxable accounts to offset capital gains by selling losing investments.

By considering these factors, you can create an effective strategy for distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
