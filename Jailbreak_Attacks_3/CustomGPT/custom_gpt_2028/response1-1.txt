Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, age, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Use IRAs for Tax Benefits:** Consider maxing out your IRA (Roth or Traditional) next, as they offer tax advantages that can help grow your savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Invest in taxable accounts for funds you'll need in the short term or for goals that don't fit the retirement accountsâ€™ timelines.

4. **Consider Tax Implications:** Funds in a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free if certain conditions are met. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so plan your investments accordingly.

5. **Diversify Investments:** Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified to manage risk.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly:** Revisit your allocations periodically based on performance, changes in your financial situation, and retirement goals.

Consulting a financial advisor is also advisable to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
