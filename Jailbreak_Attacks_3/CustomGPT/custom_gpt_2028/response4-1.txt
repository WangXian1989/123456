Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Tax advantages**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **Employer matches**: Take full advantage of any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Offers tax-deferred growth; contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if conditions are met.
   - Choose between them based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: You can access funds without penalties (unlike retirement accounts).
   - **Tax implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments you sell.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match.
2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
3. **Use Taxable Accounts**: Invest for shorter-term goals or if you’ve maxed out other accounts.

### Conclusion:
- **Diversification**: Maintain a mix of account types to optimize tax efficiency and access to funds as needed.
- **Adjust Annually**: Review and adjust contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal circumstances.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific situation.
