Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.

3. **Finish 401(k) Contributions**: After taking advantage of the match and contributing to your IRA, return to your 401(k) and aim to reach the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable investment accounts. They offer more liquidity and can provide capital gains and dividends.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified to minimize risk.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Consider tax implications. For example, holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts can reduce tax burdens.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions. 

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and long-term goals.
