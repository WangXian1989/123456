Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are usually pre-tax, lowering your taxable income today. However, withdrawals during retirement are taxed as income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax advantages as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   
3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate money according to your risk tolerance. Stock funds generally have higher growth potential, while bonds provide stability.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account, which ensures you donâ€™t have to tap into retirement accounts prematurely.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments like index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Consult a Professional**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy to your situation.

Balancing contributions across these accounts can enhance your overall financial health and retirement readiness.
