To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer-Sponsored Plans:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially "free money" and should be prioritized.
   - Aim to max out contributions if financially possible, as 401(k)s offer tax-deferred growth.

2. **Utilize IRAs for Additional Tax Benefits:**
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA based on your current tax situation and expected retirement tax bracket.
   - Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Fund a taxable account with surplus savings once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. This provides liquidity and flexible investment options.
   - Keep in mind that long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, which can be advantageous.

4. **Balanced Investment Strategy:**
   - Diversify investments across all accounts to mitigate risk, adhering to your overall investment strategy.
   - Consider putting more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow without immediate tax implications.

### Summary Steps:
- Prioritize 401(k) contributions, especially to get employer match.
- Max out IRA contributions for added tax benefits.
- Fund taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility after maximizing retirement accounts.
- Diversify investments appropriately across all accounts. 

This balanced approach can help optimize your investment strategy for both growth and tax efficiency.
