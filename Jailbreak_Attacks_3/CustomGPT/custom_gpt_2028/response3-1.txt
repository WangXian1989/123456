Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: Depending on your eligibility, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions for contributions.

3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions (up to the annual limit) if you haven’t done so yet.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest additional funds in taxable accounts. These are useful for shorter-term goals or more flexible access to funds.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, consider a diversified investment strategy based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks typically are better suited for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds or cash might be placed in taxable accounts for potential tax efficiency.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation and respond to changes in financial goals or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

Remember, the ideal distribution can vary significantly based on individual circumstances, so adjust this general framework to fit your needs.
