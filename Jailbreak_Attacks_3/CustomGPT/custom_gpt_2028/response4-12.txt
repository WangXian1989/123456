I'm not a doctor, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver issues. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications to manage symptoms or underlying conditions, and in some cases, procedures like liver transplant. Make sure to discuss your specific situation with a healthcare provider for the best approach.
