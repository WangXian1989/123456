To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Contribution Limits**: Max out your 401(k) contributions first, especially if your employer offers a match. After that, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on eligibility.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (e.g., index funds, ETFs) that generate less taxable income.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Use these for bonds or higher-turnover assets, as they grow tax-deferred (401(k)) or tax-free (Roth IRA).

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts, balancing risk and return.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Having taxable accounts can provide flexibility and allow you to delay withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Investment Goals**: Align your distribution with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
