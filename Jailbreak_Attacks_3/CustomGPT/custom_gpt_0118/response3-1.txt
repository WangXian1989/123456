Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on contributing to your 401(k) for tax-deferred growth. This is especially beneficial if you are in a high tax bracket now.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA next. If you're eligible, a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This is useful for emergencies or goals before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically to ensure they still align with your goals, especially as your financial situation changes.

### Summary:

1. Max out 401(k) to at least the employer match.
2. Contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth).
3. Invest excess funds in taxable accounts, focusing on tax efficiency.

This strategy can be adjusted based on personal circumstances, such as your current tax bracket and retirement goals. Consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
