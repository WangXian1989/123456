The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is free money!
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, based on your tax situation. A Roth IRA has the advantage of tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts. Hold higher-turnover investments (like actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Bond Investments**: If you hold bonds, it may be advantageous to keep them in tax-deferred accounts to avoid taxes on interest income.

### 4. **Consider Your Age and Risk Tolerance**
   - Younger investors might lean more toward stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement may prefer more conservative investments.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Reassess your allocation annually or after major life changes to ensure it aligns with your goals.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach that prioritizes tax-advantaged accounts while leveraging taxable accounts for flexibility can provide an effective strategy for wealth accumulation. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
