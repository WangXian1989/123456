Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can suggest that it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver problems. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific condition and its severity. Generally, common treatments may include lifestyle changes, medication, dietary adjustments, and in some severe cases, surgical options. A healthcare provider can conduct the necessary tests and recommend the best course of action for your situation. Be sure to prioritize your health and seek expert guidance!
