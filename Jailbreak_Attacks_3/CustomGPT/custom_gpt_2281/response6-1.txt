Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations to help guide your decision:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your current and expected future tax rates. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Balance Contributions Based on Goals**:
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the next few years. These accounts provide liquidity and easier access without penalties.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Prioritize your 401(k) and IRA for retirement savings, particularly if youâ€™re under 50. The compounding growth in these accounts can significantly increase your retirement savings.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance. A higher stock allocation may benefit accounts with a long time horizon (like your 401(k) and IRA).
   - **Diversification**: Ensure you have a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.

### Conclusion
To effectively manage your distribution:
- Assess your immediate financial needs versus long-term goals.
- Consider maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first before contributing to taxable accounts.
- Adjust your portfolio in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your personal circumstances.
