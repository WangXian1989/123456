Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match before allocating money elsewhere. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals later.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investment allocation across these accounts aligns with your overall risk tolerance and investment strategy. You may want to hold different types of investments in each account based on their tax implications.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type. Generally, it's best to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs), and finally, tax-free accounts (Roth IRAs) during retirement.

4. **Balance Contributions**:
   - If you're maxing out your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA and have additional funds, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. 

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your accounts to ensure that your investments remain aligned with your goals, especially as market conditions change.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - Since each individualâ€™s situation is unique, it can be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial objectives and circumstances. 

By allocating your money strategically among these accounts, you can enhance your potential for growth while managing your tax liability effectively.
