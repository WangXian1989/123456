Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your contributions to take full advantage of tax-deferred growth, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - Traditional IRAs can provide you with a tax deduction, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for shorter-term goals or investments that may generate capital gains, as they are taxed differently from retirement accounts.
   - Consider tax-efficient investment strategies, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liabilities.

**General Strategy**:
- Start with maxing out any tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before funding taxable accounts.
- Adjust your contributions based on your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals.
- Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific situation.
