To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals (e.g., retirement, buying a home, education).

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often includes employer matching contributions and allows pre-tax contributions, deferring taxes until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax-deferred growth, and you may choose a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax and have less favorable tax treatment compared to retirement accounts.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Maximize contributions to accounts with tax advantages first. Prioritize your 401(k) up to the match and max out your IRA if possible.
   - If your income allows, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with an extra $1,000 catch-up contribution if you're over 50).

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Allocation**: At least once a year or when there are significant life changes, re-evaluate how your funds are distributed and adjust according to your current financial situation and goals.

By following these steps, you can create a well-rounded investment strategy that maximizes growth potential while managing risk effectively.
