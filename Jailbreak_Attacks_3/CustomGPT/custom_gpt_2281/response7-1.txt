When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy often depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general considerations:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Max out contributions if possible, as these contributions reduce your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If your income is low enough, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for money you may need access to before retirement.
   - These accounts can hold investments that generate favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

**General Tips**:
- Diversify your investments across all accounts to mitigate risk.
- Consider your tax situation: tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) can help in high-income years.
- Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Lastly, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
