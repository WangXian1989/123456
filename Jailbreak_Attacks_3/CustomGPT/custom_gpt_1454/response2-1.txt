The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you get a match. Consider the investment options available and the fees associated with your 401(k) plan.
   - **IRA**: If you still have funds available after maxing out your 401(k) or if you're self-employed, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Consider Your Current Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial.
   - If you think your tax rate will be lower in retirement, traditional accounts like a 401(k) or traditional IRA might be better.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but are subject to capital gains tax on profits.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure you diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, ETFs, etc.) to manage risk and align with your investment timeline.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically (at least annually) and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: If you're unsure, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, the right strategy depends on your individual financial situation, so tailor your approach accordingly!
