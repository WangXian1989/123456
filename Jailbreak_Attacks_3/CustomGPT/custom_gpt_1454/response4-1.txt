When it comes to distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically, contributions are made pre-tax, which means you won't pay taxes until you withdraw money in retirement. Some employer plans offer a Roth option where contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar to a 401(k), traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don't offer tax advantages, but you can access your funds at any time. Gains are subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if there's a matching contribution. This is essentially "free money."
   - Once youâ€™ve maximized your employer contribution, consider funding an IRA (either traditional or Roth) to take advantage of its tax benefits.

3. **Consider Income and Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA could be advantageous.
   - If you're currently in a lower tax bracket, contributing to a traditional IRA or 401(k) may make more sense to benefit from tax deductions now.

4. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - **Contributions**: Aim to max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions before investing in taxable accounts. The IRS sets annual contribution limits (for 2023, it's $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs, with catch-up contributions allowed for those over 50).
   - **Withdrawals**: Develop a strategy for when and how to withdraw from these accounts in retirement to manage your tax liability efficiently. Generally, withdrawals from taxable accounts are taxed at capital gains rates, while 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.

5. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across these accounts to ensure it aligns with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. They can offer personalized advice that takes into account your overall financial picture.
