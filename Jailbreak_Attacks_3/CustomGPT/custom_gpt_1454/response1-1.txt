The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Focus on maxing out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before investing in a taxable account. These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly enhance your growth over time.

3. **401(k) Contributions:** Contribute to your 401(k) regularly. If your workplace offers a Roth 401(k), consider your current and expected future tax rates to decide whether to go traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax).

4. **IRA Contributions:** Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income eligibility and tax situation. If eligible, a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, which can be beneficial in retirement.

5. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts, you can invest in a taxable account. This is useful for flexibility and accessing funds before retirement age without penalties.

6. **Diversification:** Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are well-diversified to manage risk.

7. **Regular Review:** Regularly review and adjust your investments and contributions based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and personal goals.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
