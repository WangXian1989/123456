Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial goals, time horizon, and current tax situation. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After obtaining the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth). Each has different tax benefits:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, providing tax diversification.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can begin to invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your overall asset allocation strategy. Generally, equities are favored in tax-advantaged accounts due to their long-term growth potential and associated tax implications. Bonds, which generate interest income taxed at ordinary income rates, might be better suited for taxable accounts.

5. **Consider Future Tax Bracket**: Think about your expected future tax bracket. If you believe youâ€™ll be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts may be advantageous. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower bracket, Traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain sufficient liquidity for emergencies. While investing aggressively can yield high returns, having 3-6 months of living expenses in a readily accessible account is crucial.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your distribution strategy as your financial situation, goals, or tax laws may change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.
