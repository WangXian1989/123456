Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free" money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on them until you withdraw in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket when you retire, these accounts can be beneficial.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is an attractive option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have an adequate emergency fund in a more liquid account before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be beneficial for:
   - Flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.
   - Utilizing tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Allocate assets according to your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your distribution annually to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market changes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary, and a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your situation.

It's essential to tailor any strategy to your unique circumstances and goals!
