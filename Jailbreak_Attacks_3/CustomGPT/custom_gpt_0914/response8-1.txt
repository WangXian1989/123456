Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can greatly impact your long-term financial health. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Choosing between the two depends on your current tax situation and whether you prefer tax-free growth (Roth) or tax deductions now (traditional).

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you still have funds available after contributing to your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k). This can lead to higher tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider investing in taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility in terms of accessing funds but doesn't provide the same tax advantages.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account, ensure you’re diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your goals, risk tolerance, and life changes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, consider consulting with a financial planner.

This strategy balances short-term accessibility with long-term growth while taking advantage of available tax benefits.
