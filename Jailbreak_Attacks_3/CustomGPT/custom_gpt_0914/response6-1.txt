Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **IRA:** Consider opening a traditional or Roth IRA. If your income allows, max out contributions for tax benefits.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation
- **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider how investments in taxable accounts will be taxed. Interest and short-term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. Diversification Strategies
- **Asset Allocation:** Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each type of account.
- **Risk Tolerance:** Align your distribution strategy with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 4. Consider Withdrawal Strategies for Retirement
- Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes, typically withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** 25%  
- **Traditional IRA:** 25%  
- **Roth IRA:** 25%  
- **Taxable Accounts:** 25%  

This structure can provide a good balance of tax benefits and flexibility. Adjust percentages based on personal circumstances and goals. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
