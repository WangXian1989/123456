When considering the best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take several factors into account, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially "free money."
   - **401(k) Contributions**: After the match, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions if you have room in your budget.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income level and the type of IRA (traditional vs. Roth), consider contributing to an IRA next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are subject to capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell investments. They may be suitable for short-term goals or for investment strategies that focus on tax-efficient investments.
   - **Offsetting Taxes**: Consider holding assets with lower growth potential or lower turnover in your taxable accounts to minimize taxable events.

3. **Invest Based on Time Horizon**:
   - **Long-Term Goals**: For long-term goals (like retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts with equities and growth investments.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: For short-term goals (like buying a home), keep a portion in safe, liquid assets, potentially in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts that reflects your risk tolerance and investment strategy. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically assess your portfolio's allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions. Make adjustments as necessary.

6. **Seek Professional Guidance**:
   - If you're unsure about your allocation strategy or tax implications, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts and considering your individual circumstances, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
