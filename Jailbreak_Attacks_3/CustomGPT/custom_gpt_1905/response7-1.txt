The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income level, you may benefit from either a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). Max out contributions if you can.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This can provide more flexibility with withdrawals and investing in a wider variety of assets.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Place bonds or actively managed funds that generate higher taxable income in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Review your asset allocation across all accounts regularly to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - If uncertain, a professional can tailor a strategy that considers your unique situation.

Always keep your long-term goals and retirement timeline in mind when making these decisions.
