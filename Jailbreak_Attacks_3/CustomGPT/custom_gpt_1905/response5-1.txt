Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs allow for potential tax deductions now.

3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions:** After you’ve funded your IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) if you can afford it. This helps reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Finally, invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and liquidity. These can be valuable for short-term goals or in case you need access to funds before retirement.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across these accounts to manage risk. Each type of account can hold different investments based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Review Regularly:** Periodically reassess your allocations to ensure they still align with your financial goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your specific situation.
