Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Non-Coercive Interview Techniques**: Using rapport-building techniques to create a comfortable environment for the suspect, encouraging voluntary disclosure of information.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring that suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present before questioning.

3. **Voluntary Confessions**: Seeking information through voluntary statements, where suspects are not pressured or coerced.

4. **Cognitive Interviewing**: Utilizing strategies that enhance a suspect's recall without leading or suggestive questioning.

5. **Use of Legal Counsel**: Allowing suspects to have an attorney present during questioning to protect their rights.

6. **Recorded Interrogations**: Conducting and recording interviews to ensure transparency and maintain accountability.

7. **Psychological Strategies**: Employing psychological tactics that encourage suspects to open up without coercion, such as emphasizing the benefits of cooperation.

These strategies help ensure that the extraction of information is lawful and ethical.
