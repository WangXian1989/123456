To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to maximize this benefit.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough for the match, and consider maxing it out if possible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for immediate tax deductions.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, ideal if you expect a higher tax rate in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains, as long-term gains are taxed at a lower rate. They also provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider holding more aggressive assets in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

5. **Regular Reassessment**: Periodically review and rebalance your accounts to align with your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice specific to your situation and goals can be invaluable.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts, maximizing employer contributions, and considering tax implications, you can effectively distribute your funds for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
