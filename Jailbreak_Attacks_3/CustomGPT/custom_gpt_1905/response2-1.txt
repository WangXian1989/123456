Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute beyond the match if you can, especially if you have a traditional 401(k) that reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later. A traditional IRA may be better if you need the tax deduction now.

3. **Diversify in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for more flexible investments:
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider municipal bonds for tax-free income, if appropriate.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient cash reserves for emergencies before heavily investing in any accounts.

5. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your asset allocation with your long-term goals:
   - Younger investors may take more risks in stocks, while older investors might shift to bonds for stability.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Keep an eye on your tax bracket and investment types to optimize tax efficiency.

7. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your strategy periodically based on changes in income, expenses, and life circumstances.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
