(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Generally, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially ‚Äúfree money.‚Äù

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match, prioritize contributions to your IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly enhance your savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can direct additional funds into taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility in accessing your money, but it may be subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you are diversifying your investments within these accounts to manage risk.

A financial advisor can help you create a personalized distribution strategy based on your specific needs.
