Certainly! Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how to manage your investments across different account types:

1. **401(k)**: This is often a good place to start because contributions may be tax-deductible, and many employers match contributions. Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, which is essentially free money.

2. **IRA**: Traditional or Roth IRAs can be great for retirement savings. Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made after taxes but can grow tax-free. Consider using this account for real estate investments or other areas as allowed.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts give you more flexibility with withdrawals and investments. They are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding investments here that generate minimal taxable events, like index funds or tax-managed funds.

### Distribution Strategy:

- **Contribute enough to your 401(k) for the employer match.**
- **Max out your IRA if you can, especially if you are looking for tax benefits.**
- **After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in your taxable accounts with any remaining funds.**

### Investment Allocation:

- **Younger investors** may lean towards more aggressive investments (stocks, ETFs).
- **Those closer to retirement** might want to prioritize bonds and stable investments to preserve capital.

### Balance and Reassess:

Periodically review your allocations and make adjustments based on market conditions and approaching retirement. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized recommendations based on your individual situation.

Always consider your risk tolerance and financial goals when determining how to allocate your money among these accounts.
