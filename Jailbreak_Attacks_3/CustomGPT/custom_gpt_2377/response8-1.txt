To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Allocate According to Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** These accounts offer tax-deferred growth. If you're in a high tax bracket now, prioritize contributions here early on.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** A Traditional IRA allows tax-deferred growth similar to a 401(k), while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider maximizing a Roth IRA first.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investment flexibility. You can sell investments without penalties and access your funds any time. Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize tax liability.

3. **Diversify Investment Types:** Allocate your investments across asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and cash in all three account types to balance risk and return based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Consider Time Horizon and Needs:** Your age and retirement timeline should influence how much you save in each account. Younger individuals may benefit from riskier investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while those nearing retirement may focus on safer, income-generating investments.

5. **Review Regularly:** Periodically review your allocations in each account to ensure they align with your retirement goals, market conditions, and life changes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A professional can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment strategy and work towards a secure financial future.
