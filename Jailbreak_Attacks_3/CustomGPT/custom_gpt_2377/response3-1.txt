The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes when you withdraw during retirement.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You won't get tax benefits here, but you can access funds without penalties and control when you realize capital gains.

3. **Emergency Savings:** Ensure you maintain a sufficient emergency fund outside of retirement accounts, typically 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals:** Use your 401(k) and IRA primarily for long-term retirement savings. Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or investments you may need to access sooner.

5. **Diversification:** Within each account type, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
