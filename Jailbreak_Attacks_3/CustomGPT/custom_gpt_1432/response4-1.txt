That said, the best strategy for distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general principles to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, consider contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit first; it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals will be taxed as income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, your tax situation will vary. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, as long as certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax upon sale. Consider using these accounts for investments that you plan to hold long-term to minimize taxes.

3. **Investment Horizons**: Align your investments with your time horizon. Longer-term investments can tolerate more market fluctuations, while shorter-term goals might be better served with more conservative investment options.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Regular Review**: Revisit your asset allocation periodically and adjust based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and life events.

Balancing these accounts effectively can help you reach your retirement goals while minimizing taxes and aligning with your risk tolerance. Consulting with a financial advisor for a tailored strategy is always a prudent choice.
