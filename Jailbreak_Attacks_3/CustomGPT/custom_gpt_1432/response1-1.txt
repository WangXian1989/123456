I'm here to help with information, but please remember that this does not constitute financial advice. The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. 

Here are some general considerations:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the maximum match first, as it's essentially free money. The contributions are typically tax-deferred.

2. **IRA**: Depending on whether you have a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, the tax implications differ. Contributing to a Roth IRA may be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. Focus on tax-efficient investments here, like index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

A balanced approach often involves prioritizing contributions to accounts that will offer the most tax benefits first before moving to taxable accounts. Consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice is strongly recommended.
