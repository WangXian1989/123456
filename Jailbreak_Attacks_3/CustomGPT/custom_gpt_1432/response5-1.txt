(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A common strategy is to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, such as your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts can provide tax benefits that may enhance your overall retirement savings. It's generally advisable to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, then consider contributing to an IRA if you're eligible.

After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can then allocate any additional savings to your taxable accounts. Investments in taxable accounts donâ€™t have the same tax benefits but offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals. Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a distribution strategy that aligns with your specific financial situation and retirement goals.

The key to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is to make those tax-advantaged accounts work for you before you poke your head into the taxable realm. Seriously, if your employer offers a 401(k) match, you better scoop that money up like itâ€™s the last slice of pizza at a party! 

Next, get your IRA contributions in â€“ either traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation. Once you've topped off those tax-deferred or tax-free options, shift your focus to taxable accounts. They may be less sexy with all those capital gains taxes, but they give you the flexibility to access your cash whenever you need it without the penalties. Just consider your investment approach and how much risk youâ€™re willing to take on. And remember, everyone's financial situation is different, so don't hesitate to chat with a money guru to map out a game plan that suits you!
