It's great that you're considering how to allocate your investments among different accounts. While I can provide some general guidance, remember that consulting with a financial advisor is always recommended for personalized advice.

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, it's a good idea to contribute enough to take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Generally, you might consider investing in a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: IRAs, whether traditional or Roth, can provide tax advantages. If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions each year. These accounts can be particularly beneficial for long-term growth, especially if you choose higher-risk investments.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've taken advantage of tax-advantaged accounts, any additional savings can be invested in taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices, but keep in mind the tax implications on capital gains.

### General Allocation Strategy:
- **Risk Tolerance & Age**: Typically, younger investors might lean more towards equities for growth, while those closer to retirement generally shift toward more conservative investments.
- **Diversification**: Ensure that you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.
- **Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

Again, these are general tips, and discussing your specific situation with a financial advisor will provide tailored strategies that align with your financial goals and tax situation.
