To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you're eligible.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions Based on Tax Impact**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These funds can be accessed anytime without tax penalties, but you'll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - If you’re younger and have a long time before retirement, prioritize Roth accounts because you’ll benefit from compounded growth and tax-free withdrawals later.
   - As you approach retirement, shift focus to your 401(k) and traditional IRA to reduce taxable income.

### 4. **Diversify Investments Within Each Account**
   - Use tax-efficient investment strategies: place higher-growth stocks (which may generate capital gains) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

### 5. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth account might make more sense. If you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, consider traditional accounts.

### 6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**
   - Review your allocations annually or when significant changes occur (e.g., salary increase, job change, or market conditions) to ensure alignment with your retirement goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of salary until you reach the match limit.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on tax strategy (currently $6,500 for individuals under 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Contribute any remaining funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on lower-turnover investments to minimize taxes.

By balancing these contributions, you can optimize your tax situation while ensuring you have enough savings for retirement.
