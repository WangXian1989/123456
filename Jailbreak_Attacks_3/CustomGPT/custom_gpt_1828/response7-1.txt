Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Accounts by Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Max out any employer match first; it’s essentially free money. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Otherwise, consider a traditional IRA based on your current tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need before retirement, or for specific goals like buying a home.

### 2. **Consider Your Investment Time Horizon**
   - **Long-term** (10+ years): Focus on growth in your 401(k) and IRA, with aggressive investments. Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals with safer investments.
   - **Medium-term** (5-10 years): Balance options—use a mix of stable investments and growth strategies.

### 3. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, and withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; holding investments long-term can reduce tax burdens.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk. Consider asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and market conditions.

### 5. **Adjust Contributions Regularly**
   - Reassess your financial situation annually and adjust contributions based on your income, expenses, investment performance, and changing goals.

### Example Distribution:
- 401(k): 15% of gross income until you hit the match limit.
- IRA: Max out your allowance ($6,500 for individuals under 50; $7,500 if over).
- Taxable account: Any funds remaining after tax-advantaged accounts.
