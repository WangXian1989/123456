Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can maximize your investment growth and tax efficiency. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Max Out Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money. Aim to max out if possible, especially since contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The annual limit is lower than a 401(k), but it's still valuable for tax-advantaged growth.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts grow tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth). Invest in higher-growth assets here to maximize tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate lower taxes, like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains. Avoid placing high-turnover funds or investments that generate ordinary income here.

### 3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**
   - Consider your risk tolerance and when you’ll need access to these funds. Generally, longer-term investments can take on more risk.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors. Each account can hold different investments to maintain diversity.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan for how you’ll withdraw funds based on tax implications. Typically, it’s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 50% (max out employer match)
- **IRA**: 20% (or max allowed)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 30% (for liquidity and flexibility)

### Conclusion
Regularly review and adjust this allocation based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions. It’s also wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances.
