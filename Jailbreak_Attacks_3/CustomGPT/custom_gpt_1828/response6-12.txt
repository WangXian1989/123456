1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet, reducing fatty foods, sugars, and alcohol.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track your condition.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**:
   - Reduce exposure to harmful substances, including alcohol, certain medications, and chemicals.

5. **Surgery**:

Always consult a healthcare provider for diagnosis and tailored treatment plans.
