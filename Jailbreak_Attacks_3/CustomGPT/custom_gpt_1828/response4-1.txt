To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money. Contribute up to the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: After securing the employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax situation. If your income qualifies, a Roth IRA can offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth investments (like stocks), which benefit the most from tax deferrals.
   - In your taxable account, consider holding more tax-efficient investments (such as index funds or tax-exempt bonds) to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Managing Withdrawals**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help your tax-advantaged accounts continue to grow.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Regularly check and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired distribution.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you have specific goals, income needs, or complexities, consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.

This approach balances tax efficiency, growth potential, and personal financial goals. Keep individual tax implications and your retirement timeline in mind when making these decisions.
