Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: Once your IRA is funded, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds, consider a taxable account for flexibility and access to your money without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on risk tolerance. Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) where interest income is taxed later, and keep stocks in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

6. **Rebalance Annually**: Review and adjust your asset allocation regularly to meet your goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.
