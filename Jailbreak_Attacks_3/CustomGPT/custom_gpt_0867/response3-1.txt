Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if it fits your budget.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're unsure about your future tax rate, a Traditional IRA could be a better fit for tax deductions now.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Funds in a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed upon withdrawal. In contrast, Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider placing more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-turnover funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversify Investment Types**:
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.). A well-rounded portfolio can help manage risk and improve returns over time.

4. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a separate savings account before aggressively contributing to these investment accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and your personal circumstances.

A good rule of thumb is to prioritize accounts based on employer matching, contribution limits, and your specific retirement timeline and strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your situation.
