Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategy based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - Depending on your income and tax situation, consider maximizing your 401(k) contributions (up to the annual limit).

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - The choice between Traditional and Roth should depend on your current versus expected future tax rate.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals**:
   - If you have short-term financial goals (like buying a home), consider using taxable accounts.
   - You can also use these accounts to invest in assets that produce favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains.

4. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA).
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Keep your overall investment portfolio diversified across all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your accounts based on changes in your financial situation and goals.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice specific to your circumstances.
