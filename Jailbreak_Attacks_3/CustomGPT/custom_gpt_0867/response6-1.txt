To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal. Consider maxing out employer matches as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, but contributions may or may not be tax-deductible based on your income. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider holding less tax-efficient investments, like bonds, in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - Start by funding your 401(k) to at least the employer match.
   - Next, consider maxing out an IRA, especially if itâ€™s a Roth, for tax-free growth.
   - Finally, allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across accounts:
     - High-growth assets (like stocks) should be in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
     - Bonds or other income-generating assets can be placed in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Adjust your portfolio as needed based on changes in market conditions and your financial goals. This helps maintain your desired level of risk across all accounts.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement to minimize taxes, potentially using funds from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### Summary
Distribute funds by prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts, diversifying asset types based on tax efficiency, and regularly rebalancing your portfolio to align with your long-term financial goals.
