Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match before considering other accounts.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally, contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income. Consider maxing this out if you havenâ€™t yet.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, you might choose a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Maximize contributions to this account based on eligibility.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, where you can benefit from lower tax rates compared to ordinary income rates.

4. **Investment Strategy**: The asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account should align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. For example:
   - Higher-risk investments might be better in a Roth IRA to take advantage of tax-free growth.
   - More stable, income-generating investments could go into a taxable account, where you may want to manage capital gains more carefully.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate liquid funds set aside outside these accounts for emergencies.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.
