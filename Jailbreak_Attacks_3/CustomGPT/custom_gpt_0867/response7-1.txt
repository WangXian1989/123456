Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Both are tax-advantaged accounts. Contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional accounts) or grow tax-free (Roth accounts). Consider your current tax bracket and expected retirement bracket when choosing.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax on investments when sold. Interest and dividend income are also taxed, so consider holding tax-efficient investments here.

3. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - If youâ€™re young or in a lower tax bracket, contributing more to a Roth IRA might be beneficial for tax-free growth.
   - If you're closer to retirement, a traditional 401(k) or IRA may offer immediate tax benefits.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Each account can have a different investment strategy based on tax implications and withdrawal plans:
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends to benefit from lower tax rates.

5. **Emergency Funds and Debt**: Ensure that you maintain an emergency fund outside these accounts and consider paying off high-interest debt before maximizing contributions.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation and tax laws may change, so review this distribution annually to adjust as necessary.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
