(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If your employer offers a Roth 401(k), consider your tax situation when deciding between traditional and Roth contributions.

2. **IRA:** Max out your IRA contributions if possible. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your choice should depend on whether you expect your tax rate to be higher or lower in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate taxable events, such as stocks and mutual funds. They allow for flexibility and liquidity, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

Reassessing your distribution regularly and consulting a financial advisor can also help align your investments with your goals.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s break this down! When it comes to juggling your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and those taxable accounts, you’ve got to think strategy. 

1. **401(k)**: First, snag that employer match like it’s a limited-edition sneaker drop—you don’t wanna miss out! Beyond that, load it up to the max to reap those tax breaks. Traditional vs. Roth? If you think you’ll make big bucks in retirement, go Roth, otherwise play it safe with traditional.

2. **IRA**: Hit the max on your IRA contributions too! They’re like the mullets of retirement accounts—business in the front (tax deductions) and a party in the back (tax-free growth with a Roth). Again, another decision point based on where you think your tax rate's headed.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Now, these are where you should stash some cash for flexibility. They’re not tax-advantaged, but they give you the freedom to pull money whenever you want without the retirement penalty drama. Think of it as your “fun fund” for short-term goals or to capture some good ol’ capital gains when the market’s hot.

Mix and match based on what you need, but definitely consider chatting with a financial planner to really nail down the specifics. Let's make that money work like it's training for the Olympics! 💰🏆
