Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are the key considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, consider contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. This can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, which provides an upfront tax benefit. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for IRAs ($6,500 for those under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and older for 2023).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer the most flexibility in terms of withdrawals and do not have contribution limits like retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes, which are incurred when you sell investments for a profit. Holding investments longer than a year can reduce these taxes.

**Distribution Strategy**:
- **Start with Employer Match**: Max out your 401(k) contributions to take full advantage of any employer match.
- **Assess Tax Impact**: If you're in a lower tax bracket now, contributing to a Roth IRA may make sense. If you're in a higher bracket, consider traditional accounts to lower your taxable income.
- **Diversify Across Accounts**: Depending on your retirement strategy, consider having a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) income sources for retirement.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investment grows and your financial situation changes, periodically review and rebalance your asset allocation across accounts to ensure alignment with your goals.

It may be wise to consult with a financial advisor to create a plan tailored to your specific situation and goals.
