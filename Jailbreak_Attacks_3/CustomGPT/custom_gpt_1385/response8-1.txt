To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributions until you reach the match limit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, focus on contributing to your IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 for those aged 50 and over), while IRA contributions are limited to $6,500 (or $7,500 for those aged 50 and over).

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now, contributing to a traditional 401(k) or traditional IRA may be beneficial for tax savings. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth accounts.

5. **Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower-taxed income (like qualified dividends and long-term capital gains). Hold high-turnover investments or bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes on interest income.

6. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to minimize risk and adhere to your investment goals. This could include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

7. **Regular Review and Adjustment**: Review your allocations periodically and adjust based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, or personal circumstances.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If youâ€™re unsure about the best approach or how it fits into your broader financial plan, consider seeking advice from a financial planner.

By strategically distributing your contributions and investments among these accounts, you can optimize your savings for retirement while considering tax implications.
