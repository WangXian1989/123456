I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. Treatment options may vary depending on the specific liver condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medication, and in severe cases, liver transplantation. Please reach out to a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
