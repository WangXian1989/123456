Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maximizing contributions, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket. Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income, while Roth options grow tax-free.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions. Aim to fully fund these accounts if you're under the income limits.

3. **Assess Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer greater flexibility in terms of withdrawals.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals, especially as market conditions change.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Consider the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type when you reach retirement. Withdrawals from taxable accounts might be more favorable depending on your tax situation then.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
