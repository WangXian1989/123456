Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contributions Limits**: For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Consider Tax Benefits**: Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but can grow tax-free.
   - **Annual Limit**: For 2024, the contribution limit is $7,500 (or $9,000 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow you to withdraw money without penalties, making them good for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments in taxable accounts.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Prioritize** contributions to your 401(k) up to the match, then fund your IRA (choosing the type based on your tax situation), and finally invest in taxable accounts for flexibility.
- **Use a Balanced Approach**: Diversify investments within these accounts to manage risk.

### Final Considerations:
- **Assess Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your investment choices align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.
- **Review Periodically**: Regularly check your allocations and make adjustments based on market conditions and life changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice specific to your situation.
