Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a practical approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great first step.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you can, consider maxing out a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your income level and tax strategy. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may allow for tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: After hitting the IRA contributions, continue to fill up your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit. If your 401(k) has high fees or limited investment options, consider prioritizing your IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income (like bonds) or for funds you may need before retirement. It's also beneficial for flexibility if youâ€™re thinking about early retirement or major purchases.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.). Generally, it can be more tax-efficient to hold bond investments in tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs, while keeping stocks in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains taxes on long-term investments.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Annually review your contributions and asset allocation based on your financial situation and goals. Adjust according to any changes in income, expenses, or life events.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get maximum employer match (e.g., 5-10% of salary)
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum for the year ($6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and older in 2023) 
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any remaining funds for flexibility.
