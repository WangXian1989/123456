To effectively allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider funding a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs are preferable if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as they allow for tax-free withdrawals.

2. **Assess Your Time Horizon**: Funds in a 401(k) or IRA are typically intended for retirement, so if you're saving for a long-term goal, prioritize these accounts. If you have shorter-term financial goals, such as buying a house or funding education, consider allocating more to taxable accounts, where withdrawals are more accessible without penalties.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure your investments are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment objectives. Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, which are less likely to trigger capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Remember that 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions lower your taxable income for the year, while withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Conversely, paid taxes on contributions to a Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. In taxable accounts, be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments, particularly for short-term gains.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: As your investment goals, risk tolerance, or market conditions change, periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial objectives.
