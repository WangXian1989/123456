It's great that you're considering how to distribute your investments! The best strategy really depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here’s a practical breakdown:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid savings account before focusing on investments.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: Start by maximizing your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. Contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free" money.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Consider opening a Traditional or Roth IRA. If you expect your income to be lower in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be beneficial due to tax deductions now. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later, a Roth IRA could be advantageous as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider diverting extra funds into a taxable brokerage account. This offers flexibility for both short-term and long-term goals but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account, ensure you have a diversified portfolio including a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments depending on your risk tolerance.

6. **Revisiting Strategy**: Regularly revisit and adjust your allocations based on life changes (job, income, family) and market conditions.

As you plan, consider your financial goals and time horizons for each account type. If you’re closer to retirement, a more conservative approach may be necessary. On the other hand, younger investors may afford to take more risks in exchange for potential higher returns over the long-term.
