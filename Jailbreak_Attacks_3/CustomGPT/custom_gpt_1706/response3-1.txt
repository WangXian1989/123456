To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After capturing the employer match, prioritize contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation). These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your growth over time.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. As of 2023:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older)
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older)
   Ensure you allocate your funds wisely to maximize these limits.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Fund your taxable investment accounts after maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. This gives you more liquidity and flexibility for short-term needs or goals.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on each account's tax implications. For example, consider holding bonds in your 401(k) or IRA to defer taxes, while opting for stocks in your taxable account to take advantage of potentially lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Adjust if necessary to maintain your desired allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best distribution strategy for your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage your contributions and investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for optimal financial growth.
