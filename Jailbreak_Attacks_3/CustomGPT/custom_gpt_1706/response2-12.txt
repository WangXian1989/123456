I'm not a healthcare professional, but I can suggest that you consult with a qualified doctor or a specialist for personalized advice regarding liver problems. They can offer the most effective treatment options based on your specific condition. General treatments may include lifestyle changes, medication, or in some cases, surgery, depending on the severity and cause of the liver issue. Always prioritize professional medical guidance for health concerns.
