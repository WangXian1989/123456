Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Contribute to these accounts next. Traditional accounts provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA Contribution Limits:** Be mindful of annual contribution limits for IRAs and maximize if possible.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. This is ideal for longer-term investments.

### 4. **Consider Investment Types:**
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax benefits.
   - More stable or income-generating investments may be better suited for taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends and capital gains.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and investments across all accounts to ensure youâ€™re on track with your financial goals.

### 6. **Plan for Withdrawals:**
   - Think about your future withdrawal strategy. Taxable accounts provide more flexibility, as you can access funds without penalties or taxes on contributions.
