I'm not a doctor, but here are some general options for liver treatment that you might discuss with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid saturated fats, sugar, and salt.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.
   - **Alcohol Moderation**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications like antivirals for hepatitis, or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.

4. **Supplements**: 
   - Some may benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but always consult a doctor before starting any.

5. **Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures such as a liver biopsy or even a liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult a healthcare provider for a tailored plan specific to your condition.
