To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA (Roth or Traditional) before putting money into taxable accounts. 

3. **Investment Growth**: In your 401(k) and IRA, invest in growth-oriented assets since they can benefit from compounding without immediate tax implications.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high taxes, such as bonds or assets prone to capital gains, to avoid higher taxes in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you will withdraw from each account in retirement. Generally, itâ€™s beneficial to leave tax-deferred accounts for later to maximize growth.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes to manage risk.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation and goals.
