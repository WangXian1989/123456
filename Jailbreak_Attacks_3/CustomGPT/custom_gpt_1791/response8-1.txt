Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax deductions.

2. **Assess Your Investment Goals**:
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep funds in a taxable account for easier access.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for compound growth.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and ETFs in all accounts, adjusting based on account tax implications (e.g., tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts).

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for future withdrawals, knowing that taxable accounts might be more flexible while tax-advantaged accounts can have penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
