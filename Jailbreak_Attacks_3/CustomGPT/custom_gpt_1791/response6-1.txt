Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. Assess Your Goals
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need sooner.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts for tax advantages.

### 3. Diversification Strategy
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that may incur capital gains taxes over time.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Ideal for growth-oriented assets, as taxes are deferred until withdrawal.

### 4. Rebalance Regularly
   - Shift allocations as needed to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy over time.
