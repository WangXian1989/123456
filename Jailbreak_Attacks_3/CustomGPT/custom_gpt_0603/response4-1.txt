Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some key considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k):**
   - **Contribution Limits:** Maximize your contributions to take advantage of employer matching, if available. In 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 for those under 50 and $30,500 for those over.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth), impacting your current taxable income. 
   - **Investment Choices:** Evaluate the investment options available; they may be limited compared to IRAs.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, you can contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Tax Advantages:** Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax bracket.
   - **Flexibility:** IRAs often have a broader range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Investing After Taxes:** Consider investing in a taxable account for flexibility. This is useful for goals not tied to retirement and allows access to funds without penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Long-term holdings (over a year) generally incur lower rates than short-term gains.
   - **Diversification:** You can hold various investments, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

### **Suggested Distribution Strategy:**
1. **Maximize Contributions:** Start by maxing out any employer match in your 401(k), then contribute to an IRA.
2. **Tax Considerations:** If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. 
3. **Maintain Liquidity:** Keep a portion allocated to a taxable account for short-term needs and liquidity.
4. **Evaluate Annually:** Regularly reassess asset allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Conclusion:
The best approach balances tax efficiency, growth potential, and liquidity needs. Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific goals and circumstances.
