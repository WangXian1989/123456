Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s free money!
   - **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this can be beneficial.

2. **IRA** (Traditional or Roth):
   - **Max Contributions**: Aim to contribute up to the annual limit to a Traditional or Roth IRA. 
   - **Roth IRA Considerations**: If you qualify, a Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement. Suitable for shorter-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) that generate fewer taxable events.

### General Distribution Tips:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts.
- **Asset Allocation**: Your distribution should also align with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Consider diversifying within each account type.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations annually to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out 401(k)** up to match, then increase contributions if possible.
- **Contribute to a Roth IRA** for tax-free growth if eligible.
- Use **taxable accounts** for any additional savings, focusing on liquid, tax-efficient investments.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor the best approach for your specific situation!
