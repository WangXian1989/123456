The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some key considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Focus on contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions to reduce your taxable income.
   - Invest in a diversified mix of assets that align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Limit your contributions to the annual limit set by the IRS.
   - If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, this can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Choose investments that align with your long-term growth strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use this account for savings goals that are shorter-term or for funds that you may need more access to without penalties.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments; consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Before allocating funds, ensure you have an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of living expenses.
- **Percentage Distribution**: Consider allocating a percentage of your total investment contributions:
  - 401(k): 50-60%
  - IRA: 20-30%
  - Taxable Accounts: 10-20%

### Final Steps:
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in financial situations, tax laws, and market conditions.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances. 

This strategy helps maximize tax advantages while maintaining flexibility for both long-term and short-term financial goals.
