The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After getting the match, consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are likely to generate high taxable income, such as bonds or actively managed funds, or for funds you may need to access before retirement without penalties.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: In taxable accounts, focus on investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio remains diversified across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio as needed due to changes in financial goals, market conditions, or tax laws.

Ultimately, working with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
