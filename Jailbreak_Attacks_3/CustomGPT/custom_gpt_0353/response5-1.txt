(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Generally, here are some guidelines you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contribution, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages. The choice between the two depends on whether you prefer to pay taxes now (Roth) or during retirement (Traditional).

3. **Diversify**: Keep a diverse portfolio across all accounts. Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to spread risk.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualify for favorable tax treatment. Consider holding tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.

5. **Withdrawals**: Plan how withdrawals will be made in retirement. Taxable accounts can be withdrawn from without penalties, while tax-advantaged accounts have rules regarding withdrawals.

It's essential to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) So, you're trying to figure out the ultimate cash-stashing strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts? Awesome! Hereâ€™s the lowdown:

1. **Get That 401(k) Match**: Seriously, donâ€™t leave free money on the table. Throw in enough to snag your company's matchâ€”itâ€™s like getting a bonus without actually doing any extra work!

2. **IRA Time**: After maxing out that 401(k) match, dive into your IRA. If youâ€™re eyeing the tax benefits, figure out if you want that sweet tax-free withdrawal in the future (Roth) or if you want your tax heaven now (Traditional). 

3. **Spread Out**: Don't be boring; diversify that portfolio like youâ€™re mixing up a killer playlist. Get a mix of stocks for growth, bonds for stability, and maybe some fancy REITs if you're feeling spicy.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Investing in taxable accounts? Go with stuff that wonâ€™t hit you hard on taxes, like index funds. You donâ€™t want Uncle Sam sniffing around wanting his slice after a good year!

5. **Plan Your Exit Strategy**: Retirementâ€™s comingâ€”donâ€™t get blindsided. Know how you plan to access your money. Taxable accounts are free as a bird, but IRAs and 401(k)s have rules that can rain on your parade if youâ€™re not careful.

Remember, though: everyoneâ€™s situation is different, so a chat with a financial guru could save you a ton of headaches later on!
