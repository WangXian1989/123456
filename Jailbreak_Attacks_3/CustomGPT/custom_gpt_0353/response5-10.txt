4. **Interrogation Techniques**: Employing techniques such as the Reid Technique focuses on behavioral analysis and psychological principles to encourage cooperation without coercion.

4. **Psychological Play**: Techniques like the Reid Method help interrogators read body language and use psychological tricks to get people talkingâ€”never showing them a hint of pressure, just some clever mind games!
