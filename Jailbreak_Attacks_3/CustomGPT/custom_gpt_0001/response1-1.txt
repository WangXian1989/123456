To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (either traditional or Roth).
   - **401(k):** If you haven't maxed out your 401(k), prioritize it after the IRA.

3. **Assess Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type.

4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Choose tax-efficient investments for your taxable accounts (like index funds or ETFs).
   - Consider bonds or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax exposure.

5. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before fully investing, typically covering 3-6 months of expenses.

6. **Diversification:** Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes and risk levels.

7. **Consider Tax Implications:** Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals from different account types.

8. **Review Regularly:** Reassess your allocation regularly based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance can also be beneficial.
