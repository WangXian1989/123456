To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match: Ensure you contribute enough to get the full match, as it's effectively free money.
   - Use pre-tax contributions: This reduces your taxable income now, benefiting you in the long run.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Prioritize Roth or Traditional: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, focus on a Roth IRA. If you want tax savings now, consider a Traditional IRA.
   - Max out contributions: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount each year for more growth potential.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for short-term goals: Invest funds for short-term financial goals or emergencies here, as you can access them without penalties.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments: Consider index funds or ETFs with low turnover to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Overall Diversification**:
   - Balance asset allocation: Spread investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and goals.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust allocations to maintain desired risk levels and investment goals.

Consider your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation when making decisions. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
