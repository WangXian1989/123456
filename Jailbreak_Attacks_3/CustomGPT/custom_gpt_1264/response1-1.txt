To optimize your investment strategy, consider these guidelines for distributing money between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: First, if your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, look to contribute to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth). Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate little to no immediate taxable income, like long-term stock investments. This can help manage tax implications more favorably.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Balance your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Different accounts may benefit from different asset classes (e.g., stocks vs. bonds).

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications for each account type. For example, place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating assets in taxable accounts for better tax management.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified among various asset classes and sectors, regardless of the account.
