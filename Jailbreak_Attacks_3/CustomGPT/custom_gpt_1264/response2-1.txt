To optimize your distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out this account if possible.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Each account type can hold a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.). Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like ETFs) and hold less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - Keep in mind that different accounts have different withdrawal rules and tax implications. Plan accordingly to minimize taxes when you start withdrawing funds.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly check and rebalance your portfolio across accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside these accounts before heavily investing, as this impacts your ability to take on risk.

6. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**:
   - Allocate more towards growth in accounts with longer timelines (like a 401(k)) while keeping some liquidity for immediate needs in taxable accounts.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.
