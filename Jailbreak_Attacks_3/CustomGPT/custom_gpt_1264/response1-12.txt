I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for specific liver problems. Treatment options typically depend on the underlying cause, which could range from lifestyle changes, medications, or even surgery for more severe conditions. It's really important to work with a healthcare provider who can guide you through the best course of action tailored for your situation. Stay healthy!
