The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, your current tax situation, and your retirement timeline. Here are some general considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k):** 
   - Many employers offer a matching contribution, so try to contribute at least enough to capture the full match; it's essentially free money.
   - Contributions reduce your taxable income in the year you make them, which can be beneficial for tax purposes.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, depending on your income level and whether you're covered by a workplace retirement plan.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider a Roth if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for short- to medium-term goals.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in a taxable account.

### Suggested Approach:
- **Contribute Enough to Your 401(k):** Maximize employer match.
- **Fund an IRA Next:** If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
- **Allocate Remaining Funds to Taxable Accounts:** Use these for goals that are closer in time or for more liquid investments.

### Additional Tips:
- **Diversification:** Ensure your investments in each account are diversified across different asset classes.
- **Regular Reassessment:** Periodically review and adjust your contributions and investment strategies as your financial situation changes.

It's always a good idea to consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your needs and circumstances.
