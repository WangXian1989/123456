When considering how to allocate your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to evaluate several factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax implications. Here’s a general approach to distributing your money:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money and a great place to start.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider contributing to either a Traditional IRA (which may provide tax deductions) or a Roth IRA (which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement). The choice between the two can impact your tax strategy.

3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of contribution limits for each account type:
   - **401(k)**: The limit for employee contributions is $22,500 for 2023, with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you are age 50 or older.
   - **IRA**: The contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: There are no contribution limits, but you'll need to manage capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified investment strategy across these accounts. Each account may hold different assets based on your investment goals. For example, you might prefer to hold more aggressive investments in your Roth IRA (since withdrawals are tax-free in retirement) while having more conservative investments in your taxable accounts.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Take into account the tax implications of each account:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are made pre-tax, and taxes are paid on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends are subject to tax, so manage your investments for tax efficiency.

6. **Adjust as Needed**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and life events.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that fits your specific situation and goals.

Remember, this allocation strategy can vary widely based on personal circumstances, so it’s always best to tailor it to your unique financial picture.
