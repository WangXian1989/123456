When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—this is essentially free money. Depending on your income and tax bracket, contributing to a traditional 401(k) may also reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: After maximizing any employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. You can choose between a Traditional IRA (where contributions may be tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (where contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement).

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Decide on an appropriate asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Younger individuals may prefer a higher allocation towards equities for growth, while those closer to retirement may lean towards bonds to preserve capital.

3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Remember that money withdrawn from a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA is taxable as ordinary income, while withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free if rules are followed. Distributing your assets in a tax-efficient manner throughout retirement can help minimize taxes.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility in terms of withdrawal and investment options but are subject to capital gains tax. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Reassess Periodically**:
   - Regularly review your investments and tax situation. Adjust your contributions based on changes in your income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

Make sure to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation, as they can provide personalized guidance based on your unique financial landscape.
