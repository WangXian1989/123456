Allocating your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have any high-interest debt (like credit cards), prioritize paying that off before contributing too much to your retirement accounts.

3. **Contribute to a Roth IRA (if eligible)**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider maxing out contributions there, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: After your employer match and Roth IRA contributions, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions, as they reduce your taxable income for the year.

5. **Use a Traditional IRA for Additional Tax Benefits**: If you have reached the contribution limits for your 401(k) and Roth IRA but want more tax-advantaged savings, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA. Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and filing status.

6. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’re maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to a taxable investment account. This allows for more liquidity and flexibility with your investments.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Remember to consider your own personal financial situation and consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
