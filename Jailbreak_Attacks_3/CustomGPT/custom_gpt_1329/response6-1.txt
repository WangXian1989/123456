When considering the allocation of your investments between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to understand the unique features and benefits of each account type. Here are some general strategies for effective distribution:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially "free money." 
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax situation, capitalizing on tax-deferred or tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-term growth**: Focus on equities in tax-advantaged accounts to take advantage of compound growth without immediate tax implications.
   - **Short-term needs**: Keep more liquid assets and conservative investments in taxable accounts since you'll need access without penalties.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Place income-generating assets** (like bonds or dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or eliminate taxes on growth.
   - **Hold capital gain assets** (like growth stocks) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates when sold.

### 4. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**
   - Adjust your contributions and allocations as your financial situation, tax laws, and investment opportunities change over time.

### Conclusion
Creating a balance among these account types involves understanding both your immediate needs and long-term goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide customized strategies based on your personal situation. Always consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline when making decisions.
