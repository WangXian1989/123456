Finding the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your current financial situation, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match before putting money into other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may give you tax advantages now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for assets that may generate significant capital gains or for money that you might need in the short term, as these accounts are more flexible. They also offer certain tax advantages, like favorable long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Keep tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA), and place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize your tax burden.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy suited specifically for you.
