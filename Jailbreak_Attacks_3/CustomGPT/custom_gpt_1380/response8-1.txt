The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and retirement outlook.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency:** Funds in a taxable account are subject to capital gains taxes when sold, whereas investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) grow tax-deferred or tax-free. Generally, place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds and REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient options (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversify Your Investments:** Ensure your assets are diversified across different types of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

5. **Review Your Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

6. **Adjust Based on Your Age and Timeline:** If you are younger, you may afford to invest more aggressively for higher returns. As you approach retirement, consider shifting to more conservative investments to preserve capital.

7. **Regularly Rebalance:** Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.
