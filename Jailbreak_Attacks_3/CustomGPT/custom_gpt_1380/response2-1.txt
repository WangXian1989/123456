To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA as they offer tax benefits. If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match before considering other options.

2. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**: Understand your current and anticipated future tax brackets. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing more to a Roth IRA (if eligible) or making after-tax contributions to your 401(k).

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider holding more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (where taxes on growth are deferred) and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

4. **Account for Withdrawals**: Plan where you will withdraw funds from in retirement. Taxable accounts can be accessed without penalty, while withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts (401(k)s and traditional IRAs) may incur taxes.

5. **Consider Fees and Investment Options**: Evaluate the fees associated with each account type and the investment options available. Sometimes, a 401(k) might have limited options or higher fees than an IRA or taxable account.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and asset allocation to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions. Rebalance your portfolio as needed.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best distribution strategy, consider working with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation.

By strategically allocating your investments across these three types of accounts, you can effectively manage your tax liability, optimize growth potential, and prepare for retirement.
