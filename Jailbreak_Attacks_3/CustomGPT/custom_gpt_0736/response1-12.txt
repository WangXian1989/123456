I'm not a doctor, but the best treatment options for liver problems can vary depending on the specific condition. Common treatments may include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, maintaining a healthy weight, and increasing physical activity. Medications may also be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes. In more severe cases, a liver transplant might be necessary. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
