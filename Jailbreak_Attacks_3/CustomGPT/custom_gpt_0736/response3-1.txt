Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some guidelines to help you make a decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), make sure to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Traditional contributions lower your taxable income now, while Roth contributions allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), IRAs can be traditional or Roth. Determine which type aligns with your retirement strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts donâ€™t offer tax advantages, but you can withdraw funds at any time without penalties. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes on any investments sold for a profit.

3. **Retirement Timeline**: If you are far from retirement, you might prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to grow your savings tax-free or tax-deferred. If retirement is near, consider balancing withdrawals from all accounts to manage your tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Diversification**: Keep your investments diversified across all accounts to mitigate risk. This includes asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, you may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings outside of these accounts for emergencies, which helps avoid early withdrawals from retirement accounts and potential penalties.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in your financial situation, investment performance, and tax laws.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
