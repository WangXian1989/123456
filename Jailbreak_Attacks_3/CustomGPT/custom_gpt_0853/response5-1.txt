Creating an effective strategy for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here’s a well-rounded approach:

### 1. **Evaluate Account Types**

- **401(k):** Often has higher contribution limits and potential employer matching. Focus on maxing out contributions, especially if there’s a match.
  
- **IRA:** Provides tax advantages (traditional IRAs for tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs for tax-free growth). Consider your income limits for eligibility.

- **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible with no contribution limits, but realize capital gains taxes may apply. Use for short-term goals or as a tax-efficient vehicle.

### 2. **Contribution Strategy**

- **Maximize Employer Match:** Start with your 401(k) to get the full employer match—it's essentially "free money."

- **IRA Contributions:** After maximizing your match, contribute to an IRA, particularly if you can benefit from a Roth IRA's tax-free growth.

- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional funds here, especially for goals shorter than retirement.

### 3. **Rebalance and Diversify**

- Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts, adjusting based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**

- For tax-efficient investing, hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs) and equities in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Long-Term Planning**

- Always align your investment strategy with your long-term financial goals, adjusting as necessary based on life changes (like retirement, buying a home, etc.).

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
