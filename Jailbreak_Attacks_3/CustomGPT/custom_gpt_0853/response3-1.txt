Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions to 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out if you have the financial capacity, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - For 2024, consider maxing out your Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Additional Investments**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may not fit into tax-advantaged accounts, like short-term trading or specific investment strategies.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to grow tax-free.
   - Use taxable accounts for lower-growth investments (like bonds) to manage capital gains taxes.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically assess your investment performance and adjust allocations based on changes in your life circumstances (e.g., income, retirement timeline).

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance specific to your situation.
