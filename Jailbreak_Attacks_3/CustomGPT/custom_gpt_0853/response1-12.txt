I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options typically depend on the specific condition. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly help.

2. **Medications**: Doctors may prescribe medications to manage conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease.

3. **Dietary Supplements**: Milk thistle or vitamin E may have benefits, but consult your doctor first.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up blood tests and ultrasounds to assess liver function and condition.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific situation.
