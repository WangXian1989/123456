Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **Traditional IRA & 401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, and growth is tax-deferred. Good for long-term savings if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible for short-term goals but are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider using these for investments you might want to access before retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk. 
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on the account typeâ€”consider more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.

4. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - If you have room, prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions before adding to taxable accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Regularly assess your portfolio and rebalance as necessary based on market conditions and personal financial goals.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your situation.

Tailoring your distribution strategy based on your unique circumstances will help maximize your investment potential and tax efficiency.
