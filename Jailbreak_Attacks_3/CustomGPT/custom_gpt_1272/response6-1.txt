Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing contributions to a 401(k), consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for money you may need in the short term or for investments that generate capital gains, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 3. **Balance for Growth and Liquidity**
   - Allocate more toward retirement accounts for long-term growth (invest in stocks, mutual funds).
   - Keep a portion liquid in taxable accounts for immediate needs or opportunities.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**
   - Younger savers may favor riskier investments in 401(k) and IRA.
   - Near retirement? Shift to more conservative investments as you prioritize capital preservation.

### Summary
- **Prioritize contributions** to tax-advantaged accounts first.
- **Diversify investments** according to your risk tolerance and timeline.
- **Regularly reassess** your strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals. 

This strategic approach allows you to effectively build wealth while minimizing taxes.
