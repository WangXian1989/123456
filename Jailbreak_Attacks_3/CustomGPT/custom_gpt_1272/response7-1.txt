Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or post-tax (Roth 401(k)), which can provide tax benefits depending on your current financial situation.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Diversification**: Consider contributing to both types of IRAs if eligible. Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits ($6,500 for individuals under 50; $7,500 for those 50 and over for 2023).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts are great for short-term goals as they allow you to access funds without penalty. 
   - **Tax Management**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **General Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing heavily.
- **Debt Management**: Pay down high-interest debt as a priority.
- **Balance Contributions**: Once youâ€™re maximizing your 401(k) match, consider routing additional funds to your IRA. Use taxable accounts for funds you might need in the short term or to take advantage of investment opportunities.

### **Reassess Regularly**
- Review your portfolio at least annually and adjust contributions based on income changes, market performance, and your financial goals.

### **Consult a Professional**
- Consider talking to a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs and circumstances. 

### **Final Tips**
- Diversify investments across all accounts to mitigate risk.
- Understand the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type in retirement.

This method can help optimize growth while considering your tax situation.
