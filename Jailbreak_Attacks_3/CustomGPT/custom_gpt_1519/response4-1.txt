I'm not a financial advisor, but generally speaking, the best way to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Traditional 401(k)s and IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts do not offer these tax advantages but allow for more flexible access to your funds.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that you are diversifying your investments across all accounts to spread risk. Different accounts may have different investment options, and diversification can help enhance returns.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before putting too much into these retirement accounts, make sure you have an adequate emergency fund in a savings account. This should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**: If you have short-term financial goals, it may be better to use a taxable account. For long-term retirement goals, maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs is generally advisable.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how youâ€™ll withdraw money in retirement. It may be beneficial to have a strategy for which accounts to withdraw from first, as this can impact your tax situation.

7. **Consult a Professional**: Given the complexities of tax laws and investment strategies, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

Remember, each financial situation is unique, so it's important to assess your individual needs and objectives when deciding how to allocate your funds.
