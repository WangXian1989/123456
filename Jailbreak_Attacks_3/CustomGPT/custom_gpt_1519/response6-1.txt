Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is an important step in managing your overall investment strategy and maximizing your tax advantages. Here are some key considerations for each account type:

### 1. Understand the Tax Implications:
- **401(k):** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** You can choose between a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions). Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are not tax-deductible.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. Dividends and interest are also taxed in the year they are received.

### 2. Diversification and Risk Tolerance:
- Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, you may want to hold more aggressive, higher-growth assets in your taxable accounts if you plan to access those funds sooner.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max Out Retirement Accounts First:** Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match, then max out your IRA contributions.
- **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once your retirement accounts are funded, consider contributing to a taxable account for more liquid investments.

### 3. Regularly Reassess Your Strategy:
- Monitor your accounts and asset allocation regularly, adjusting as needed based on changes in tax laws, your financial situation, or retirement goals.

### In Conclusion:
- Aim for a balance that ensures ample growth potential while also considering tax implications to optimize your contributions. Diversification across these accounts can help shield against market volatility and tax changes.
