The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA as they provide tax benefits. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a high tax bracket, maximizing contributions to tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA) can lower your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be advantageous, allowing you to pay taxes now and withdraw funds tax-free later.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to spread risk.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level and meet your long-term financial goals. 

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need access to before retirement, since withdrawing from tax-advantaged accounts can incur penalties and taxes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of personal finance and tax laws, consider working with a financial advisor to develop a tailored strategy that fits your individual circumstances.

Ultimately, the balance of your investments should align with your personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline for needing the funds.
