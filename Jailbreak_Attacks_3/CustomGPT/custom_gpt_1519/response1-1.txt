The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are a few general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Generally, itâ€™s a good idea to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then consider maximizing your IRA contributions, especially if it's a traditional IRA which can provide you with immediate tax benefits.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes. On the other hand, investments with favorable long-term capital gains tax treatment (like stocks) may be better suited for taxable accounts.

3. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes that align with your overall investment strategy.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired level of risk and investment strategy.

5. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan ahead for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Depending on your tax situation, it may be more beneficial to withdraw from certain accounts first to manage your tax liabilities.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also a good step to tailor a strategy specific to your unique financial situation.
