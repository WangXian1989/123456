1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can benefit liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and liver function tests can help track the progress of treatment.
4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Limiting exposure to harmful substances can prevent further liver damage.
5. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgical procedures may be necessary, such as liver transplantation for severe liver disease.

Always discuss treatment options with your healthcare provider to determine the best plan for you.
