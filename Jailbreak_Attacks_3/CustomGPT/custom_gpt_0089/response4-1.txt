Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) for additional tax benefits.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional Accounts**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income in the present but subjecting you to taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Diversify your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts.
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that generate capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Consider holding bonds or other income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax implications.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

This strategy can maximize your growth potential while minimizing your tax burden.
