I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly help.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).
3. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from vitamins or supplements, but always consult a healthcare provider first.
4. **Monitoring and Follow-Up**: Regular check-ups and monitoring through blood tests or imaging studies can be crucial.

It's vital to consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and a personalized treatment plan.
