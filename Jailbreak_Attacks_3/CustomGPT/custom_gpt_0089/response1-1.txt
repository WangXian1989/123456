To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify. Maximum contributions can help reduce taxable income.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Riskier investments (like stocks) are often better suited for long-term accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) where they can grow tax-deferred.
   - Stable investments (like bonds) can be placed in taxable accounts to manage short-term cash needs.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Focus on higher-cost investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts.
   - Use lower-cost investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts for potential tax efficiency.

4. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside these accounts to avoid early withdrawal penalties.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically adjust your allocations based on performance and your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal advice can help tailor strategies based on your specific situation.

Diversifying and understanding each accountâ€™s benefits will help maximize your long-term growth.
