Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, particularly if you can choose a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may produce significant tax liabilities (like bonds) or for more liquid investments.

### 3. **Debt Consideration:**
   - If you have high-interest debt, consider paying it down before heavily investing, as the interest might outweigh potential investment returns.

### 4. **Assess Your Timeline:**
   - **Short-term Needs:** Keep cash or low-risk investments in your taxable accounts.
   - **Long-term Growth:** Allocate more funds into your 401(k) and IRA for investment growth and tax advantages.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure you are properly diversified across these accounts to minimize risk.

### 6. **Review Regularly:**
   - Reassess your allocations periodically based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.
