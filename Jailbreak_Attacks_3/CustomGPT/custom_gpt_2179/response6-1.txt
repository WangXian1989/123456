To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Max out your IRA contributions (Roth or traditional) for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Invest According to Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Use these for investments with higher expected returns or those that generate ordinary income, such as bonds or REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts).

### 3. **Consider Asset Allocation**
   - **Diversified Portfolio**: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - **Monitor Performance**: Reassess your asset allocation annually to ensure it aligns with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Taxable Accounts First**: When you start withdrawing, consider taking from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investments for growth while managing your tax liabilities effectively.
