To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this first, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**: 
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, use taxable accounts for additional investments. These can provide flexibility, as you can withdraw funds without penalties, though you will owe taxes on any capital gains.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within these accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, taking into account market performance.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of tax efficiency in your taxable accounts. Holding investments that generate long-term capital gains can be beneficial tax-wise compared to frequent trading.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your specific situation and goals by consulting with a professional, especially for complex scenarios.

By following these steps, you can maximize your returns and minimize your tax liability over the long term.
