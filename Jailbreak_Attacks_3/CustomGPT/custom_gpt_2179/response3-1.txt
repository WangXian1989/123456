Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute Enough to Get Full Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize this as it’s essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA:** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible upfront, reducing your taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   
### 3. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Consider holding investments that you plan to sell within a year in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversify Asset Allocation**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for high-growth investments that you want to shield from immediate taxes. 
   - Keep more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications effectively.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation regularly to ensure you're on track with your financial goals and your risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If your situation is complex, it may be beneficial to consult a financial planner to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific circumstances.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full match and possibly up to the annual limit.
- **IRA:** Max out your IRA contributions (if eligible) after your 401(k) match.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest additional funds here once you've maximized contributions to your pre-tax and tax-advantaged accounts.

This approach helps balance tax efficiency and investment growth. Adapt these principles based on your individual financial situation and goals.
