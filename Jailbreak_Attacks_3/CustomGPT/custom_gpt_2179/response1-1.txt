To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals). Contribution limits apply.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible access to funds, but subject to capital gains taxes when investments are sold.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts** (401(k) and IRA) should be prioritized for investments expecting the highest growth (like stocks) to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Taxable accounts** are better suited for more stable investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **401(k)**: Invest in a diversified mix (stocks, bonds) based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Similar to your 401(k), but factor in your long-term goals and withdrawal plans.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for flexibility and to access funds without penalties if needed before retirement.

### 5. **Target Contribution Levels**:
   - Allocate funds based on your overall retirement strategy. Start with maximizing the 401(k) match, then consider maxing out an IRA, followed by additional contributions to your 401(k) and taxable accounts.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Reassess your strategy annually or when there are significant life changes (e.g., job change, salary increase, or market shifts).

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If youâ€™re uncertain or have complex financial situations, a professional can help tailor strategies based on your specific needs.

By maximizing employer matches, considering tax implications, and diversifying your investments, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
