Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. It’s essentially “free money.”
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: If you expect your tax rate in retirement to be higher, a Roth IRA may be beneficial. For lower expected rates, a Traditional IRA might be better for tax deferral.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: You can contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50) in 2023.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Utilize Them for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for expenses you might incur in the short-term (e.g., a home purchase, education).
   - **Focus on Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider index funds or tax-managed funds to minimize tax implications.

4. **General Strategies**:
   - **Diversification**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk.
   - **Rebalance Periodically**: Maintain your desired asset allocation by periodically adjusting your portfolio based on performance.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your investment strategy based on your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across different types of accounts.
