The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is effectively free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, to take advantage of tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions lower your taxable income, but withdrawals will be taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for funds you may need before retirement. Focus on investments with lower turnover to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, ETFs) to balance risk and reward.
   - Use tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts to reduce capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your asset allocation annually based on performance and changes in your risk tolerance or financial goals.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have enough liquid savings before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific circumstances and goals.
