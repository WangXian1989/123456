Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match first, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maxing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate lower taxable income, such as municipal bonds or long-term stocks to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

3. **Consider Investment Goals**:
   - If saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. If you need liquidity or plan for short-term goals, prioritize taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your asset allocation reflects your risk tolerance and financial goals across all accounts.

5. **Rebalance**:
   - Regularly check your investment distribution and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consulting a financial advisor is also wise for personalized strategies tailored to your circumstances.
