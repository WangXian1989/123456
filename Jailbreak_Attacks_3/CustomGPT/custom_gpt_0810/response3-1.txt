Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, with potential matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed on withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account; can be Roth (tax-free withdrawals) or Traditional (tax-deferred). 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments taxed annually on dividends and capital gains. Offers more flexibility but less tax efficiency.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match; it's effectively free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions to benefit from tax advantages.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Place assets that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or long-term capital gains.

### 4. **Diversify Investment Types**
   - Maintain a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to balance risk and returns.

### 5. **Reevaluate Regularly**
   - Review your allocations periodically (annually or biannually) and adjust based on changes in your life situation or market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

By combining these strategies, you can create a balanced investment approach that aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
