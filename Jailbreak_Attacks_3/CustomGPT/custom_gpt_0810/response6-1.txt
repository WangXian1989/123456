To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax Advantages
- **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions here if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money.
- **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a Roth or Traditional IRA for tax-free growth or immediate tax benefits, respectively.

### 2. Assess Your Time Horizon
- **Long-Term Goals**: Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for retirement.
- **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for investments you'll access sooner, as they offer more flexibility.

### 3. Diversify Investments
- **Asset Allocation**: Spread investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets to balance risk.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on market performance and changing goals.

### 4. Consider Withdrawal Strategies
- Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### Conclusion
Tailor this distribution based on your specific goals, age, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice.
