The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you qualify for tax deductions, consider maximizing your contributions here as well. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   
### 2. **Assess Your Investment Goals:**
   - For long-term growth, focus on equity investments in your tax-advantaged accounts due to their potential for higher returns and tax deferral. 
   - Use your taxable account for investments that generate lower taxes, such as municipal bonds or long-term capital gains.

### 3. **Consider Your Current and Future Tax Bracket:**
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, prioritize traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) for tax deferral.
   - If you believe your tax rate will be higher, prioritizing Roth accounts can be beneficial.

### 4. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts:**
   - Diversifying across different account types can help manage tax liability and provide more flexibility in withdrawals.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments to ensure they align with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

### Summary:
- Prioritize 401(k) contributions to get the match, then fund IRAs, and finally taxable accounts. Tailor your investments based on tax implications and your time horizon to optimize growth and manage taxes effectively. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
