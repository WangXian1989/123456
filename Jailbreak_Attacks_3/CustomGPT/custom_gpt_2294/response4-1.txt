Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). IRAs often offer more investment options than 401(k)s.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: If you have additional funds, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This helps reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate excess savings to taxable investment accounts. These can be useful for flexibility, as you can access funds without penalties.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of your investment choices in each account type. For instance, hold tax-efficient investments (such as index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Account Types Based on Goals**: Align your contributions with your financial goals:
   - Short-term goals: Taxable accounts
   - Retirement goals: 401(k) and IRA
  
7. **Diversification**: Ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk.

8. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your strategy based on changes in income, goals, and tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice specific to your situation.
