Allocating your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to at least get any employer matching contributions.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds if available.
   - **Tax Advantage**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

### 2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional and Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Suitable for individuals looking for immediate tax benefits. Similar investments as your 401(k) can be used here.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Limitations**: Be mindful of contribution limits and eligibility based on income.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Use this account for needs beyond retirement (e.g., a house or college expenses).
   - **Investment Strategy**: Emphasize tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Asset Location**: Consider placing bonds or income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to minimize tax exposure on interest income.

### Distribution Strategy
1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs before adding to taxable accounts.
2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Adjust contributions based on whether you're in a high or low tax bracket.
3. **Align with Investment Goals**: Ensure each account aligns with your long-term objectives and timeline.

### Final Thoughts
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation. Diversifying investments across different accounts can also help manage risk and enhance returns over time.
