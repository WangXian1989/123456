To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, aim to maximize contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

3. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are pre-tax, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have adequate liquidity in a separate savings account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Consider Your Goals**:
   - If you need access to funds before retirement, prioritize contributions to taxable accounts, as they provide more flexibility.

6. **Ongoing Review**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Consider working with a financial advisor to develop a customized strategy tailored to your specific situation.

By following these guidelines, you can structure your investments to maximize growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities.
