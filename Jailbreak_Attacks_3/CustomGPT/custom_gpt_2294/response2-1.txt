Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are tax-deferred, so consider putting a larger portion here if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Strategy**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and withdrawals in retirement are taxed. Good for those who expect to be in a lower tax bracket later.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Ideal if you expect higher income in retirement.
   - **Contribute**: Max out contributions annually if possible, especially if you’re eligible for a Roth IRA.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use for funds you might need before retirement or for short-term goals. This allows easy access without penalties.
   - **Investment in Tax-Efficient Assets**: Consider holding investments like index funds or ETFs, which are generally more tax-efficient.
   - **Tax Loss Harvesting**: This strategy can reduce your tax burden by selling losing investments to offset gains.

### Summary Strategy:
- **Prioritize 401(k)** for matching contributions.
- **Max out IRA** contributions for tax advantages.
- Use **taxable accounts** for flexibility and access.
  
### Regular Review:
Regularly assess and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and life circumstances. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
