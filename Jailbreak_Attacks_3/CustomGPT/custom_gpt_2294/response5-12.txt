1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet low in fats and high in fruits and vegetables.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids or immunosuppressants for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Frequent check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: 
   - Completely avoiding alcohol is often recommended.

5. **Treatment for Underlying Conditions**: 
   - Managing conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol can improve liver health.
