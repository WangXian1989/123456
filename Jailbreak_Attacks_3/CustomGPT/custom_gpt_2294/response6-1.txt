Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here’s a simple breakdown:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, or a traditional IRA for tax deductions now.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments with high potential for growth and lower tax implications (like long-term capital gains) once your tax-advantaged accounts are funded.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Aim for a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in all accounts, but align them with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 4. **Regularly Rebalance**
   - Review your allocations annually to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

### Considerations:
- **Retirement Goals:** Define when you plan to retire and how much income you will need.
- **Tax Bracket:** Stay aware of how distributions from these accounts affect your tax situation.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can maximize your savings for retirement while minimizing tax burdens.
