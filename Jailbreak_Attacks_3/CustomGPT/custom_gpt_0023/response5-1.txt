To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit after the employer match.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. Focus on:
   - **Investing in Tax-Efficient Funds**: Use index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Buying Low-Turnover Investments**: These typically incur fewer taxes from trading.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**: Plan how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement to minimize taxes.

### Considerations:
- Assess your current tax situation and retirement timeline.
- Adjust contributions based on changes in income or expenses.

By prioritizing contributions in tax-advantaged accounts first, you can maximize your long-term growth and minimize taxes upon withdrawal.
