When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s essential to consider each account's tax implications, contribution limits, and investment goals. Here are some general guidelines to help you make a well-rounded decision:

1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match before allocating more funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money!

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you qualify.

3. **Continue to Fund 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contribution, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This can help reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This is especially useful for accessing funds before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are well-diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Consideration of Taxes**: Be mindful of the tax implications when withdrawing from these accounts in retirement. Generally, funds from 401(k) and Traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals (if qualified) and earnings from taxable accounts can be more favorable.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust them based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

It's always advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
