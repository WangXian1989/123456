Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), ensure you are contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. If you’re eligible, a Roth IRA is often preferred for its tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue Funding Your 401(k)**: After funding your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This allows you to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable brokerage accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and can be beneficial if you plan to access the funds before retirement.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments within these accounts are well diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to manage risk.

6. **Batch Contributions**: Depending on your cash flow, you might want to consider whether to contribute regularly (dollar-cost averaging) or in lump sums to take advantage of market conditions.

7. **Reassessment**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions and investment allocations based on your evolving financial situation and retirement goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that aligns with your specific goals and circumstances.

It's crucial to consider tax implications and investment horizons when deciding how much to allocate to each account. Each account type has its own rules, benefits, and restrictions that can affect your overall strategy.
