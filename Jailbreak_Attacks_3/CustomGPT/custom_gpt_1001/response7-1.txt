To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Start with contributions to your 401(k) until you reach the match limit.
   - **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, which offers tax advantages. The choice between the two depends on your current tax bracket and expected retirement tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This could be beneficial for more accessible funds without withdrawal penalties.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs) will defer taxes until withdrawal, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - In taxable accounts, be mindful of capital gains tax on investments you sell and dividend taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) regardless of the account type. 

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Time Horizon and Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your timeline and financial goals. For example, if you're saving for retirement far away, a more aggressive allocation may be appropriate.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
