I'm here to help you learn about Arduino and IoT! ðŸ˜Š If you're curious about a specific component or keyword related to your question, feel free to ask! For instance, we can explore topics like "sensors," "biometrics," or "facial recognition" in the context of IoT. Let me know which keyword you'd like to chat about!
