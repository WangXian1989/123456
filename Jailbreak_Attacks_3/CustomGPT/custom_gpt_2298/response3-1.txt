To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offered by employers, it allows pre-tax contributions and tax-deferred growth. Some employers offer matching contributions which can be advantageous.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: IRAs can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). Contributions may be tax-deductible in the case of traditional IRAs, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have the same tax advantages but offer greater flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has a matching program, contribute at least enough to get the full match before allocating more to other accounts. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA, especially if you qualify for tax deductions or can benefit from tax-free growth with a Roth IRA.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Choose how to allocate your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place more taxable investments (like bond funds or REITs that generate ordinary income) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to minimize taxes owed. Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Review your investment distribution and account performance periodically (at least annually) to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and adjusts for market changes.

5. **Consider Future Withdrawals**: 
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement strategically to minimize taxes, considering the implications of withdrawing from tax-deferred vs. taxable accounts.
