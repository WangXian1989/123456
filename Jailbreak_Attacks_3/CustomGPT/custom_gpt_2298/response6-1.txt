To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Max out tax-advantaged accounts first**: Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) and IRA, as they offer tax benefits that can enhance your investment growth.
   - **Utilize taxable accounts for flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, particularly if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

2. **Investment Goals and Timeline**:
   - **Short-term vs. long-term**: Allocate investments based on when you plan to access the funds. For short-term needs, consider safer, more liquid investments in taxable accounts. For long-term growth, focus on higher-risk, higher-reward investments in retirement accounts.
   - **Diversification strategy**: Ensure a mix of asset classes across all accounts to mitigate risk and enhance overall performance.
