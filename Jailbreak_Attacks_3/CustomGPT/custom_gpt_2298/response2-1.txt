The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Taxation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often pre-tax (for traditional accounts), which can lower your taxable income. Taxes are deferred until withdrawal, typically during retirement when you may be in a lower tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are subject to capital gains taxes. Use these for investments you'll need before retirement.

3. **Investment Horizon**: If you’re younger or have a longer timeframe, consider leaning into growth-oriented investments within tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks or mutual funds) and hold more stable investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversity Across Accounts**: It can be beneficial to hold different asset classes in different accounts to optimize for taxes. For example, keep bonds (taxable income) in tax-deferred accounts and stocks in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Assess your investments periodically to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Financial Goals**: Align your account distributions with your short-term vs. long-term financial goals. For example, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings over taxable accounts. 

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be helpful to seek personalized advice based on your complete financial picture.
