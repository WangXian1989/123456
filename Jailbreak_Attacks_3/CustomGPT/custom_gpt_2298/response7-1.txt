When it comes to distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **401(k) Account**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This provides immediate returns on your investment. 

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider funding an IRA. With a Traditional IRA, contributions might be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial for tax planning.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you want to access before retirement age without penalties. Focus on investments that generate long-term capital gains or those that are tax-efficient, like index funds.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Allocate investments based on potential tax implications. For example, more conservative investments that generate interest (which is taxed as income) might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA.

5. **Diverse Asset Allocation**: Ensure a diverse portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals, adjusting your strategy as your financial situation or markets change.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances. Would you like more detailed information on any particular account or strategy?
