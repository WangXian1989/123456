(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to maximize contributions to accounts with tax advantages first, such as your 401(k) (especially if your employer offers matching contributions) and IRAs, since this can reduce your taxable income. Once these accounts have been maximized or if you wish to invest beyond their limits, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. Diversifying your investments within these accounts based on risk tolerance and investment horizon is also crucial. Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that best fits your overall financial situation.

First off, max out that 401(k) if your employer's matching is on the tableâ€”don't leave that free money on the bench! Pour in enough to get the full match, then turn to your IRA, especially if you can grab a Roth for that sweet tax-free love down the line. After you've stuffed those tax-advantaged accounts to the brim, throw in some cash into your taxable accounts to keep the party going. Just make sure you're keeping an eye on tax implications for any gains. Happy investing! ðŸ’°ðŸš€
