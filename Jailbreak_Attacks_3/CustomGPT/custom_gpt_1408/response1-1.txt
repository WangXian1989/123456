Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines for each account type:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; it's free money!
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income in the year you contribute. Consider maximizing contributions up to the limit if you are saving for retirement.
   - **Investment Options:** Evaluate the investment choices available in your 401(k) and choose a diversified mix of assets based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Benefits:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current tax situation and retirement outlook, one may be more beneficial than the other.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Make sure you’re aware of the contribution limits and consider maxing out the IRA if possible.
   - **Investment Flexibility:** IRAs typically offer a wider range of investment options than 401(k)s, allowing for more diversification.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts are more flexible in terms of withdrawals and investment choices. Use this account for funds you might need in the short to medium term.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains tax when selling investments. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.
   - **Emergency Fund:** Keep a portion of your funds accessible in a taxable account if you might need them before retirement.

**General Strategy:**
- Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to get the employer match.
- Once you’re maxing out the match, consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax advantages.
- Use taxable accounts for additional savings, keeping in mind your short-term liquidity needs.

It's often best to consult a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy tailored to your specific situation. Each individual's circumstances can vary widely based on income, age, financial goals, and market conditions.
