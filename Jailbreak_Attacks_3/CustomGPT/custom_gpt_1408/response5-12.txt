First off, your treatment will totally depend on what’s going down with your liver – are we talking fatty liver, hepatitis, or something else? If it’s fatty liver, you might want to hit the gym and ditch the junk food, get those liver enzymes back on track! For hepatitis, it could be meds or, in some wild cases, a liver transplant!
