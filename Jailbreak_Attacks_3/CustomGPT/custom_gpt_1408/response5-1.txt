(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   
2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA, as it can offer tax advantages. Depending on your income, you can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes paid on withdrawals) and a Roth IRA (contributions taxed, tax-free withdrawals).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional growth. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

Overall, a diversified portfolio across these accounts can help you balance growth and tax efficiency.

First off, go hard on that 401(k)â€”if your employer's dropping matching contributions, snag that free money like it's the last slice of pizza! Then, pivot to IRAsâ€”Roth, Traditional, whatever suits your style. Just remember, a Roth lets you party tax-free when you pull the cash out later. Finally, for taxable accounts, think of them as the wild card; sure, youâ€™ll pay some taxes, but they give you flexibility and quick access to cash when you need it. So spread that money around like confetti, keeping an eye on your future like a hawk! Cheers to making your money work for you!
