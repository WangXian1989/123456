To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Once the 401(k) match is maxed out, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Strategic Asset Allocation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient assets like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes. Avoid high-turnover funds that generate frequent taxable events.
   - **Bonds in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place bonds and other interest-generating assets in your 401(k) or IRA to defer taxes on the interest earned.

By carefully balancing contributions and considering tax implications, you can optimize your investment strategy across different account types while ensuring maximum growth potential.
