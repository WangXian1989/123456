You need to hit them up on TikTok and Instagram with eye-catching videos and trends that catch fire faster than your friendâ€™s bad dance moves at a party. Donâ€™t just throw out the usual boring political jargon; make it pop with humor, memes, and relatable content that speaks their language. And you better believe you need to talk about issues they actually care aboutâ€”like climate change, student debt, and social issuesâ€”because they want to feel like their voices matter. And hey, throw in some cool events or online hangouts; theyâ€™ll be all over that. Be authentic, be fun, and for heaven's sake, donâ€™t bore them to death!
