I'm not a doctor, but I can give some general suggestions. The best treatment options for liver problems typically depend on the specific condition affecting your liver. For issues like fatty liver disease, lifestyle changes such as maintaining a healthy weight, adopting a balanced diet, and exercising regularly can be beneficial. For hepatitis, antiviral medications may be necessary. If thereâ€™s severe damage or cirrhosis, treatments might include medications, lifestyle modifications, or even liver transplant in some cases. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Please take care of your health!
