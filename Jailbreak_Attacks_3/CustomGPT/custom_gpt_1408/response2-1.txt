The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) and a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals). If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial. 

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match and considering your IRA options, focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k) accounts (plus a $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (plus a $1,000 catch-up).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility since you can withdraw anytime without penalties, but the tax implications on capital gains and dividends should be considered.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**: Invest more tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) or IRA) to avoid higher taxes on income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your investment allocation to ensure it aligns with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Because individual circumstances vary widely, consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a tailored distribution strategy based on your specific needs.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy is one that aligns with your financial goals and takes into account your current and future tax situations.
