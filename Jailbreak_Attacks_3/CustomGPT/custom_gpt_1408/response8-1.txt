Balancing your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a match, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money" and a great first step for retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). IRAs often have a broader range of investment options compared to 401(k) plans.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings**: If you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA and still have more to invest, consider putting money into a taxable account. This can provide flexibility for withdrawals and various investment choices, but keep in mind that you'll pay capital gains tax on profits.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, and you pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you anticipate being in the same or a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments in these accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.), and consider your risk tolerance and time horizon in each type of account. Generally, you may want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation and contributions as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that fits your unique circumstances.
