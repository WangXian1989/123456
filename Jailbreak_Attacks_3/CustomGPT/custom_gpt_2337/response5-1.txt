When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account factors like your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a basic strategy:

1. **401(k)**: Max out employer match contributions first, as this is free money. Then, consider contributing up to the maximum limit if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **IRA**: If eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs are also valuable for tax-deferred growth. Aim to maximum contributions if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. It allows flexibility for withdrawals but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- Start with employer matches.
- Max out Roth or Traditional IRA.
- Invest any additional funds into taxable accounts.

### Tax Considerations:
- Diversify your tax exposure by having both tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) options.
- Balance investments based on your expected income brackets in retirement.
