To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: 
   - For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 ($30,000 if age 50+).
   - IRAs have a limit of $6,500 ($7,500 if 50+), so prioritize these tax-advantaged accounts first.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals.
   - **IRA**: With Traditional IRAs, you'll benefit from tax deferral. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for short-term goals and flexibility, but youâ€™ll pay capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Diversification**: Allocate investments within these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other vehicles.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have cash reserves outside these accounts for unforeseen expenses, typically 3-6 months' worth of living expenses.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies that align with your financial goals and tax situation, consider getting professional advice.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and goals evolve.
