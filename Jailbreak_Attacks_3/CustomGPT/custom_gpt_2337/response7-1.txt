The best distribution strategy for your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income. Traditional accounts grow tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (or if you need additional investment options), consider taxable accounts. These are flexible but come with capital gains taxes on gains.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting your investments based on risk tolerance, age, and time until retirement. 

### 5. **Tax Optimization**
   - Keep more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

### 6. **Revisit Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your strategy annually based on performance, life changes, or shifts in financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights based on your unique circumstances.
