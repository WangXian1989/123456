Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer-Sponsored Plans**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Generally, consider maxing out this account if possible, given its tax advantages.

### 2. **Utilize IRAs**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this account can be beneficial since contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider funding a Roth IRA, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can use taxable accounts for additional investments. These are flexible and do not have contribution limits, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversification**:
   - Allocate funds across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals in all accounts.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy in retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, taxable accounts may be tapped first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and then tax-free accounts.

### 6. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your allocations annually based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach tailored to your personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation will help you determine the best distribution strategy. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
