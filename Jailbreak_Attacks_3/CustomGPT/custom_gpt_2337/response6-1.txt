Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and tax situation. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s free money.
- **IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for immediate tax deductions.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation
- **Tax Bracket:** Consider how much of your income will be taxed at different levels. Place higher-income investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.
- **Withdrawals:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.

### 3. Diversify Investments
- **Risk Tolerance:** Allocate a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance across all accounts.
- **Rebalance:** Regularly review and adjust the distribution to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 4. Emergency and Liquidity Needs
- **Taxable Accounts:** Keep some cash available for emergencies or significant expenses, as these accounts are more accessible without penalties.

### 5. Long-Term Growth vs. Short-Term Needs
- **Long-Term:** Focus on growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Short-Term:** Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access sooner.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach, maximizing tax-advantaged contributions while considering your overall financial goals, will help you achieve a well-rounded portfolio. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.
