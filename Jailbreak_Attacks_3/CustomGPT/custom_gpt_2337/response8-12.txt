I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications (reducing alcohol, eating a balanced diet), weight management, and regular exercise.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may help manage symptoms or inflammation (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).
3. **Nutritional Supplements**: Certain vitamins and nutrients may support liver health.
4. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases where liver function is critical, a transplant may be necessary.

Consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
