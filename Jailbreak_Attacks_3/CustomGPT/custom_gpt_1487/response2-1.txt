Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, tax situation, and financial goals. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Roth IRA (if applicable)**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After the match, consider further contributions to your 401(k), especially if it offers low-cost investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments, particularly if you expect to need the funds before retirement.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Balance your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, stocks for growth in IRAs and 401(k)s, and more stable assets in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

Regularly review your allocations and adjust as your financial situation and market conditions change. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
