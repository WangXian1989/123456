Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your contributions or at least contributing enough to get the employer match.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax bracket. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for more flexibility. These can hold investments that may benefit from capital gains treatment.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: When itâ€™s time to withdraw, plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes. Often, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help your tax-advantaged accounts continue to grow.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
