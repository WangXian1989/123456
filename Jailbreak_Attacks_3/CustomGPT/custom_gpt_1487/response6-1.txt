Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a balance of tax efficiency, growth potential, and liquidity. Here are some strategic guidelines:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k) Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, which is essentially free money.
- **IRA Options**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect your income to increase.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation
- **Current vs. Future Tax Rates**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, prioritize Roth IRAs and after-tax contributions.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate low turnover or qualified dividends to minimize taxes.

### 3. Diversify Investments
- **Asset Allocation**: Balance your investments between stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired risk profile.

### 4. Liquidity Needs
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure a portion is accessible for emergencies in a taxable account before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

### Summary
- **Prioritize contributions to a 401(k) and IRAs for tax advantages.**
- **Evaluate your tax bracket and future income for optimal strategies.**
- **Maintain an emergency fund in taxable accounts.**

By strategically distributing your assets, you can enhance growth while managing your tax exposure effectively.
