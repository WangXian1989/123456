Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize any employer match first; this is “free money.”
   - Contribute enough to reach the annual limit if it aligns with your retirement goals.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize a traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short- to mid-term goals or for investments you may need to access before retirement.
   - Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) here to minimize tax impact.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - Balance short-term needs with long-term growth.
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations annually or after major life events to ensure they meet your changing needs.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
