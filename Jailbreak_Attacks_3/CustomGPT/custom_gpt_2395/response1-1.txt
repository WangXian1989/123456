Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

### 2. **Consider IRA Contributions**
   - Once you’ve maxed out your employer match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Depending on your income and tax filing status, you may be eligible for a tax deduction on your contributions (traditional IRA) or benefit from tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth IRA).

### 3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for both 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

### 4. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are taxed in the year they're realized, and dividends may also incur taxes. However, you have more flexibility with withdrawals without penalties.

### 5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to balance risk and reward.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation as needed, especially as you approach retirement or if your financial situation changes.

### 7. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - Think about how and when you’ll withdraw money in retirement. Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 8. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specifically to your financial situation and goals.

By diversifying your contributions across these accounts and taking advantage of tax benefits, you're on the right track to effective money management and future financial security.
