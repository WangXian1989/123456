I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information on liver treatment options. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Some common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Following a liver-friendly diet, which may include low-fat, high-fiber foods, fruits, vegetables, and avoiding alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help manage weight and overall liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms, treat underlying causes, or prevent further liver damage.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-Ups**: Frequent visits to a healthcare provider for monitoring liver function through blood tests and imaging can help manage the condition effectively.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxins**: Abstaining from alcohol and being cautious with medications that can affect the liver are crucial.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people look into herbal remedies or supplements, but it's vital to discuss these with a doctor to ensure they won't interfere with treatment.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver tumors or cirrhosis, surgical options or liver transplantation may be considered.

Make sure to talk to a healthcare professional for the best course of action suited to your specific condition.
