When it comes to distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best approach depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax bracket. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating money elsewhere. It's essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. This can be beneficial if you are currently in a higher tax bracket and expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and whether you have access to an employer-sponsored plan.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be a valuable option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider using these for investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, which are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Diversification Within Accounts**: Aim for a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other assets within each type of account to balance risk and reward.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid, easily accessible account before heavily investing in your retirement accounts. Typically, this should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, it may be wise to prioritize paying it off before maximizing contributions to retirement accounts.

6. **Long-term Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your long-term financial goals. If you plan to buy a home or make a large purchase in the near future, consider setting aside funds in taxable accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, goals, and market conditions.

It's often a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your circumstances.
