The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this. This is effectively free money that can boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, taxes will be due upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type of IRA (Traditional or Roth), contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional) or tax-free upon withdrawal (Roth). If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you are eligible for a Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not offer tax advantages like retirement accounts, but they provide flexibility in accessing your money without penalties. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**: Within each account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes—stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.—to manage risk effectively.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you have a long time before retirement, you may want to be more aggressive with your investments in your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts benefit from long-term growth. In contrast, if you plan to access funds in the short term, prioritize more conservative investments in your taxable accounts.

5. **Review Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for each account type. For 401(k) and IRA accounts, there are annual limits set by the IRS. Ensure you are not over-contributing.

6. **Adjust Based on Financial Goals**: Your specific financial goals, such as buying a house, funding education, or retirement, may influence how you allocate funds. For instance, if retirement is your primary goal, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA.

7. **Periodic Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation. 

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you have complex financial needs or are unsure about the best strategy for your situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy is one that aligns with your overall financial plan, taking into consideration your unique circumstances and long-term objectives.
