To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. The money grows tax-deferred until withdrawal, typically during retirement when you may be in a lower tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and earnings grow tax-deferred. Again, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments generate capital gains and dividends that are taxed in the year they are realized. This type of account allows more flexibility but comes with tax obligations.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Each account type has different contribution limits. Maxing out employer-matched contributions in your 401(k) is beneficial, followed by contributing to an IRA (if eligible) before putting extra money into taxable accounts.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: 
   - Long-term, tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) should focus on growth assets (e.g., stocks).
   - Short-term funds in taxable accounts may be best suited for more stable investments (e.g., bonds, money market funds).

4. **Risk Tolerance**: Your risk tolerance can determine how you allocate your assets. If youâ€™re younger and can weather market fluctuations, a more aggressive approach may be suitable for retirement accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Needs**: If you might need to access funds before retirement, keep a portion in taxable accounts to avoid early withdrawal penalties associated with retirement accounts.

**Suggested Approach**:
- Start by maximizing your employer's match in your 401(k).
- Next, contribute to an IRA up to the limit if it offers tax benefits.
- Finally, invest any remaining funds in a taxable account if you have short-term or flexible needs.

Make sure to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your personal situation or the market. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique financial situation.
