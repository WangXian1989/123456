To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to obtain the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**: 
   - Contribute to your traditional or Roth IRA if you are eligible. The contribution limits are generally lower than for a 401(k), so max out your IRA before significantly increasing your 401(k) contributions, if possible.
   - If you are in a high tax bracket now, consider contributing to a traditional IRA for its tax-deferred growth. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be better as contributions are made with after-tax dollars.

3. **Utilize 401(k) for Higher Contribution Limits**: Since 401(k) accounts typically have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions after taking advantage of your employer match.

4. **Assess Your Investment Options**: 
   - Make sure to investigate the investment offerings within your 401(k) as they can vary widely in terms of options and fees.
   - For IRAs and taxable accounts, you may have more flexibility and a wider selection of investments. Consider diversifying your holdings here.

5. **Taxable Accounts as Flexibility**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for money you might need before retirement, as they allow for easier access and withdrawal without penalties. However, keep in mind the potential capital gains tax.

6. **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of living expenses) before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

7. **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging and set aside a certain percentage of your income towards these accounts consistently.

8. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on life changes (salary increases, changes in financial goals, etc.) and market conditions.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of individual financial situations, it might be beneficial to seek personalized advice from a financial planner.

Each individual's financial situation is unique, so take into account your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon when making these decisions.
