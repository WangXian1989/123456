To optimally distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits either upfront or upon withdrawal.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and withdrawal in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now, but tax you upon withdrawal.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can start contributing to taxable accounts. These accounts allow more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes on earnings.

5. **Consider Investment Goals**: Align the choice of account with your investment horizon and goals. Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth and taxable accounts for shorter-term needs.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure a diverse asset allocation across all accounts, considering the different tax implications and investment types available.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your individual circumstances.
