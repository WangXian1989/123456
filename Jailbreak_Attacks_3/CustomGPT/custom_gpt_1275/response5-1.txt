(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, income level, and tax situation. Here are some considerations:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then consider maxing out your IRA if eligible. This helps you reduce taxable income.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from 401(k) and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while taxable accounts are taxed on capital gains. Depending on your tax bracket, it may be advantageous to focus on tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified. Different accounts can hold different asset classes based on your growth needs and risk tolerance.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess and rebalance your investments based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation.

1. **401(k) First**: Hit that employer match like itâ€™s a free throw! Thatâ€™s basically free money. Next, think about maxing it out if you can. The tax savings are huge.

2. **IRA Power-Up**: If your income allows, gear up for a Roth IRA (great tax perks when you retire!) or a traditional IRA. You wanna keep those tax liabilities low now or in the future, right?

3. **Go Tactical with Taxable Accounts**: After youâ€™ve hit the sweet spots with your tax-advantaged accounts, flex your wealth in taxable ones. This helps you take advantage of lower capital gains taxes down the lineâ€”just think strategically about what you hold there.

4. **Mix it Like a Pro**: Make sure youâ€™re diversifying your assets across all accounts. Stocks, bonds, maybe some crypto if youâ€™re feeling spicyâ€”keep it interesting!

5. **Regular Check-ins**: Keep that portfolio in checkâ€”rebalance it to match your risk tolerance and life changes.

Bottom line, itâ€™s about being smart with your cash flow and keeping those future tax hits manageable! And hey, consider getting a pro on your team.
