Distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) after maximizing the match. **Traditional IRAs** can offer tax deductions, while **Roth IRAs** provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue Contributing to the 401(k)**: If you have room in your budget after maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, use a taxable account for additional investments. This is beneficial for flexibility and accessing funds before retirement.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes in all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your contributions and investment performance, and adjust as necessary based on changes in income, goals, or market conditions.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances.
