Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to maximize contributions, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket, since contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Invest Based on Time Horizon**:
   - Short-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts, where you can access funds without penalties.
   - Long-term investments are generally better in tax-advantaged accounts where compounding can minimize the impact of taxes.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Keep tax-efficient assets (like index funds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow, ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
