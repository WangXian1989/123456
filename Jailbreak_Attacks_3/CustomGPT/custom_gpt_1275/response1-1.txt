Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the match, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions. These accounts can offer tax benefits either now (traditional IRA) or in retirement (Roth IRA).

3. **Diversify Contributions**: Depending on your tax bracket, you may want to balance between pre-tax (401(k), traditional IRA) and post-tax (Roth IRA) contributions.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. Look for tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**: Think about your anticipated retirement age and potential tax implications based on when you'll withdraw from these accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your specific situation.
