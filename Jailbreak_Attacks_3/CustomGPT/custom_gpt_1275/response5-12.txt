I can't provide personalized medical advice, but I can outline some general treatment options for liver issues. Common treatments may include:

1. **Medication**: Depending on the condition, medications can help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet and exercise play crucial roles. A balanced diet low in fat and sugar, and maintaining a healthy weight can be beneficial.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests might be recommended to assess liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a tailored diagnosis and treatment plan.

For any specific treatments or details, please consult with your doctor.
