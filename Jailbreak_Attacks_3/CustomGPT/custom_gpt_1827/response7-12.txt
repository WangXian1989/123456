I'm not a doctor, but here are some options that are commonly recommended for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Improving diet (low in fats and sugar), regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly help liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver problem (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and liver function tests can help track your liver health.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options like a liver transplant may be required.

5. **Natural Remedies**: Some people use supplements like milk thistle, but talk to your healthcare provider before starting anything new.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.
