Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential employer matching; contributions are pre-tax and reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free on withdrawals). Contribution limits apply.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible investment accounts without tax advantages; you pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match before directing funds elsewhere. This is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. Conversely, if you're in a higher bracket now, a traditional IRA may save you more on taxes today.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments held longer than a year benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   - Allocate assets based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Generally, stocks are better for long-term growth, while bonds provide stability.
   - Consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and safer investments in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs:**
   - Ensure you have liquid savings (like a high-yield savings account) for emergencies before maxing out retirement accounts.

### 6. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Stay informed about contribution limits for each account type and adjust your contributions accordingly.

### 7. **Periodic Rebalancing:**
   - Review and rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation and respond to changes in market conditions.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out to employer match (e.g., 5% of salary).
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowed, choosing traditional or Roth based on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest any remaining funds, focusing on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

### Conclusion:
Tailor your distribution strategy to your specific financial goals and circumstances. Regularly revisit and adjust your allocations as your situation changes (e.g., income growth, marital status, retirement planning).
