I can't provide specific medical advice, but I can tell you that treatment options for liver problems often depend on the underlying condition. Common approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and quitting alcohol can positively impact liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or the underlying cause, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and imaging tests to monitor liver function and size may be necessary.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical interventions, like a liver transplant, might be recommended.

5. **Supplements and Herbal Remedies**: Some people explore supplements like milk thistle, but consult your doctor first.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
