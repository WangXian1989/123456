Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Prioritize contributions that maximize any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth:** Decide between traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax) contributions based on your current and expected future tax rates. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth may be beneficial.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), consider your tax situation. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous.
   - **Annual Limits:** Be aware of contribution limits ($6,500 for those under 50; $7,500 for 50 and older as of 2023).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investments without penalties. They can be useful for short-term goals or for money needed before retirement.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing:** Consider tax-efficient investment strategies, like holding index funds or ETFs, and be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Approach:
- **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get the full match.
- **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Use any additional savings for taxable accounts, focusing on more liquid investments that align with your risk tolerance.

### Factors to Consider:
- **Time Horizon:** Longer horizons can tolerate more risk (higher equity exposure), while shorter horizons might prioritize stability (bonds or cash).
- **Investment Goals:** Tailor your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, diversified funds) based on your financial objectives.
- **Tax Implications:** Always consider how distributions from each account type might affect your tax situation.

Reevaluating your allocations periodically, especially as your financial situation and market conditions change, is essential for optimizing your investment strategy. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insight.
