Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts optimally depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers matching contributions in your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing beyond the match, especially if you are in a high tax bracket, as contributions are made pre-tax and reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions) or a traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) based on your tax situation and retirement goals.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional investment. These allow for greater liquidity and tax flexibility.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Choose a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient assets (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient assets (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions and allocations based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your needs.
