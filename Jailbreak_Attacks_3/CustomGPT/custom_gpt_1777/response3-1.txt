Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your investment goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline for allocation:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is effectively "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After obtaining the maximum match from your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may offer immediate tax benefits.

3. **Back to 401(k)**: Once you have maxed out your IRA contributions for the year, go back to your 401(k) to contribute further. Check if you can afford to reach the maximum contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting money into taxable accounts. These are flexible and can be used for both short-term and long-term investing. Be mindful of the tax implications on capital gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, ensure your investments are diversified. A mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments can help manage risk. It’s generally advisable to have a more aggressive portfolio in tax-advantaged accounts and a more conservative allocation in taxable accounts to mitigate tax liabilities.

6. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering market changes and your evolving financial goals.

7. **Seek Professional Guidance**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

Remember, it's crucial to consider your overall financial picture and future needs when distributing your investments across these accounts.
