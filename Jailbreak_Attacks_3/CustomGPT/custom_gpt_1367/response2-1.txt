When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to understand the purpose of each account type and your financial goals. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Both accounts offer tax-deferred growth, meaning you won't pay taxes on earnings until you withdraw funds in retirement. Consider contributing to these accounts first to maximize tax benefits.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, contributing to a Roth IRA can be beneficial since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be a good strategy if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Money in taxable accounts does not have tax advantages but can be more flexible for withdrawals without penalties. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies to minimize tax consequences.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk and potential returns.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you're younger and have a longer time until retirement, you might favor more aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRA for growth. As retirement nears, consider shifting towards more conservative investments.

5. **Keep Liquidity in Mind**: Maintain some funds in your taxable account for easy access to cash if needed, as 401(k) and IRA withdrawals can be subject to penalties and taxes if taken before age 59Â½.

6. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type and plan your distributions accordingly to maximize your savings.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a certified financial planner can help you optimize your portfolio distribution based on your unique financial situation and goals.

Ultimately, the best way to distribute your money will depend on your individual financial situation, long-term goals, and risk tolerance. Regularly review and adjust your strategy as your circumstances change.
