Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first since it’s essentially free money. 
   - **IRA:** After maxing out any employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on eligibility and tax implications). 

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) & IRA contributions** are often made pre-tax (Traditional) or after-tax (Roth). This means you won’t pay taxes on those contributions until withdrawal (Traditional), or you won’t pay taxes at all on qualifying withdrawals (Roth).
   - **Taxable accounts** have different tax considerations, as you'll pay capital gains tax on any investment gains when you sell the assets.

3. **Allocate According to Risk and Growth Potential:**
   - You might want to allocate riskier investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains while holding safer investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where dividend and interest income would be taxed at regular income rates.

4. **Withdrawals and Timing:**
   - Plan your withdrawals from these accounts thoughtfully. Generally, many withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k)), and finally tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA) in retirement to manage tax liabilities.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust Your Strategy:**
   - Your financial situation can change over time, so regularly assess and adjust your investment strategy to align with your goals and circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
