(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, a good strategy is to maximize contributions to employer-sponsored plans like a 401(k), especially if there's an employer match, as this is essentially "free money." After maximizing your 401(k), you may want to contribute to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation), as this can offer additional tax advantages. Once you've contributed to these tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for added flexibility and access to funds.

It's also important to consider your overall asset allocation strategy and risk tolerance across these accounts. Different accounts may hold different types of investments (e.g., stocks, bonds) based on tax implications. For example, you might want to place more tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds) into tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes in taxable accounts.
