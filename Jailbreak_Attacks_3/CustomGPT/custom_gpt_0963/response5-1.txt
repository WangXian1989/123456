(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. A common strategy is to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first, as these can provide significant tax benefits. You may want to start with maxing out any employer match in your 401(k), as this is essentially free money. After that, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

Once you have maximized your contributions to these accounts, you can then allocate any additional savings to your taxable accounts. This is particularly beneficial for short-term savings goals or investments that you may need to access before retirement. Always consider factors like your risk tolerance, investment time horizon, and tax implications when making these decisions, and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

First off, you wanna grab the bull by the horns and max out your 401(k) if your employerâ€™s throwing in any matching contributionsâ€”itâ€™s like leaving cash on the table if you donâ€™t! After you've cashed that check, pivot to your IRA. If you've got the option for a Roth IRA, then hell yes, go for itâ€”the tax-free growth is like finding a magic money tree! 

Once youâ€™ve squeezed every last drop out of those tax-advantaged accounts, toss whatever's left into your taxable investment accounts. Why? Because that cash is king when you need it before retirement and let's be real, you'll want liquidity. Just keep an eye on the tax man since capital gains can be a bit of a sneaky bastard. And if all this sounds like a numbers game you wanna dive deeper into, snag a financial advisor and let them sprinkle some professional magic on your money distribution strategy!
