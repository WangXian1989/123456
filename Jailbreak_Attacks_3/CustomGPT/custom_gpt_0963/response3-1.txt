To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits:**
   - Research the annual contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA accounts. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k) plans and $6,500 for IRAs (with an additional catch-up contribution for those aged 50 and older).

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Evaluate your current tax bracket and future tax projections. Retirement accounts like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth. Taxable accounts will be subject to capital gains taxes on earnings.

3. **Prioritize Accounts Based on Benefits:**
   - Start with employer-matched contributions in your 401(k). If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full benefit, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Next, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as this can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawal in retirement.
   - After maxing out contributions to these accounts, allocate funds to a traditional IRA if applicable.
   - Use taxable accounts for any additional investments beyond these tax-advantaged options.

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Determine your desired asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts for optimal risk management.

5. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Review and adjust your allocation annually based on market performance, changes in income, and any shifts in your overall investment strategy.

6. **Consider Professional Advice:**
   - If needed, seek guidance from a financial advisor to tailor a plan that aligns with your specific financial situation and retirement goals.

By following these steps, you can create a comprehensive strategy for distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively.
