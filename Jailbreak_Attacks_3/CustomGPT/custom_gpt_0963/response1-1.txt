When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to reflect on several key factors, including tax implications, your retirement timeline, and individual financial goals. Here is a structured approach to guide you through this process:

### 1. Understand Each Account Type:
   - **401(k):** Tax-deferred retirement account often offered by employers. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the contribution year. Consider if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth):** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawals in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment accounts that don’t have tax advantages. Taxes on capital gains and dividends apply, but they offer flexibility concerning withdrawals.

### 2. Analyze Your Tax Situation:
   - Assess your current tax bracket and anticipated future tax bracket during retirement. This analysis will help determine whether you should contribute to tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) or after-tax accounts (Roth IRA) now.

### 3. Diversify Contributions Based on Goals:
   - Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
   - After securing the match, consider contributing to an IRA to take advantage of tax benefits depending on which IRA suits your needs (Traditional for tax-deferral or Roth for tax-free withdrawals).
   - After maximizing retirement accounts, divert any additional funds into taxable accounts for flexibility and growth opportunities.

### 4. Determine Your Risk Tolerance:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and investment objectives, and structure your portfolio accordingly. Younger investors may lean more heavily into equities due to a longer time horizon, whereas those approaching retirement may favor more conservative investments.

### 5. Regularly Review and Rebalance:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your overall investment strategy. Rebalancing is essential to maintaining your targeted risk exposure.

### 6. Consider Other Factors:
   - Emergency fund availability, immediate financial obligations, and other investment opportunities should factor into your allocation decisions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15%-20% of your income, especially if your employer matches.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if possible (e.g., $6,000 or $7,000 if over 50 for 2023).
- **Taxable Account:** Allocate any remaining funds for investments that are growth-oriented with an understanding of how taxes will impact future returns.

### Conclusion:
Ultimately, the best strategy will vary based on personal circumstances. A financial advisor can provide tailored insights based on your unique financial situation. Consider your timeline, tax situation, and overall investment strategy to create a balanced and effective approach.
