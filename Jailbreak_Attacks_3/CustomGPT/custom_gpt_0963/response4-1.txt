To distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k):** For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older). Employer matching should be maximized if available.
   - **IRA:** The contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Consider whether you should contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** There's no contribution limit, but this is where you'll need to consider the tax implications of capital gains and income.

2. **Assess Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Prioritize your retirement accounts if you're in a higher tax bracket, as contributions can reduce your taxable income.
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket, maximizing a Roth IRA may be beneficial for tax-free growth.

3. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to secure any employer matching funds, as this is essentially "free money."

4. **Diversify Asset Allocation:**
   - Within your 401(k) and IRA, choose a diversified mix of assets based on your long-term goals, risk tolerance, and age. Younger investors may benefit from a higher percentage of stocks, while those closer to retirement may want to allocate more to bonds.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Flexibility:**
   - Funds in a taxable account can be more easily accessed without penalties, which is advantageous for short-term needs. Reserve retirement accounts for long-term growth and retirement needs.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired balance, especially after significant market movements.

7. **Plan for Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs):**
   - Those who are 72 or older must take RMDs from traditional retirement accounts. Be mindful of this when planning withdrawals and distributions.

8. **Investment Strategies:**
   - Consider placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.
   - Use your taxable account for investments that yield qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

9. **Consult Financial Advisers:**
   - For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial adviser who can help tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Each strategy should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications, so take the time to assess which combination works best for you.
