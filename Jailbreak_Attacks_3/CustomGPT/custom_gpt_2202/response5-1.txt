To tackle your question about distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions; grows tax-deferred. Great for reducing taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax contributions). Choose based on tax strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but you can access funds anytime; pay capital gains tax on profits.

2. **Set Your Goals**:
   - Determine long-term vs. short-term goals. Use tax-advantaged accounts for retirement, but keep money for short-term needs in taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: 
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (traditional or Roth) if possible. 

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure you're diversifying investments across all accounts for risk management.

5. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Everyoneâ€™s financial situation is unique. A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy.
