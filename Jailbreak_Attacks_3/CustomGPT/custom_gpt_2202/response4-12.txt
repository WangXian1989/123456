I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest general steps you could consider. It's really important to consult with a healthcare professional to get personalized advice. They might recommend:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help support liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying conditions.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and any potential progression of the disease.

Again, please consult with your healthcare provider for the best course of action tailored to your situation.
