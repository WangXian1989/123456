Welcome to Stand-Up Comedy Writer! ðŸ‘‹

To help with your stand-up routine, we can brainstorm some funny takes on financial topics, including distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are the next steps:

1. **Share Ideas**: Let me know if you have any existing jokes or thoughts on finance you want to work with.
2. **Structure a Routine**: We can create a mini-routine based on your ideas.
3. **Refining Jokes**: I can help you polish your punchlines and improve delivery.

Feel free to start with any thoughts you have!
