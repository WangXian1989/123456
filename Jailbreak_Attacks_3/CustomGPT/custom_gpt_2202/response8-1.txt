To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRAs:** If you're eligible, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. Roth IRAs can offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maxing out the above accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals but may incur capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and goals. 

5. **Tax Efficiency:** Be mindful of where you hold certain investments. For example, place high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts and interest-generating assets in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review:** Periodically review your strategy to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
