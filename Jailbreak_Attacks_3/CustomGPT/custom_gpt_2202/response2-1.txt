Welcome to Stand-Up Comedy Writer! 👋

While I can't offer financial advice, I can help you with a comedy bit about the confusion around investing! Here’s how you can think about it:

1. **Setup the scenario**: Talk about how overwhelming financial planning can be. “I opened my investment app, and it felt like I was on a bad game show. 'Pick a box: 401(k), IRA, or Taxable account. What's behind Door Number One?'"

2. **Punchline**: Add a twist: “Then my friend says, ‘Just diversify!’ I’m like, ‘What am I, a fruit salad? I can barely keep my socks matching!’”

3. **Reflections**: Discuss how everyone has an “investment guru” friend who complicates things further. “My buddy's like, ‘You gotta hedge against inflation!’ I don’t even hedge against my own bad habits!”

Feel free to share your ideas or bits, and we can refine them together!
