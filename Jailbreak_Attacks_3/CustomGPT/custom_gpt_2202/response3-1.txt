To help you best distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some general steps you can follow:

1. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Determine your retirement goals and timeline. How much do you want to save, and when do you plan to retire?

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions, great for maximizing savings. Contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages, either as Traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible but taxed on gains annually. Good for short-term goals or to cover expenses before retirement.

3. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first. Itâ€™s free money!

4. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - Contribute to an IRA for potential tax benefits and compound growth. If you qualify for a Roth, consider if tax-free withdrawals sound appealing.

5. **Consider Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance across all accounts. Stocks, bonds, ETFs, etc., should be balanced according to your age and goals.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review allocations yearly or after major life events to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized strategies, especially considering tax implications, getting professional advice can be beneficial.
