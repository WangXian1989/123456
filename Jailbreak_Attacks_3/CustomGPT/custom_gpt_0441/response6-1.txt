To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax benefits (e.g., tax deferral or tax-free growth).
- **Understand RMDs**: Be aware that traditional IRAs and 401(k)s require minimum distributions (RMDs) starting at age 73.

### 2. Contribution Limits
- **401(k) Contributions**: For 2024, the limit is $23,000 for those under 50, and $30,500 for those 50 and over.
- **IRA Contributions**: The contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and over).

### 3. Investment Strategy
- **Risk Assessment**: Allocate riskier investments in tax-advantaged accounts, where gains can grow tax-free or tax-deferred. Consider keeping more stable, income-generating investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

### 4. Emergency Fund
- **Liquidity**: Ensure you have sufficient funds in your taxable accounts for emergencies or unexpected expenses, as these funds are more readily accessible without penalties.

### 5. Future Tax Implications
- **Roth IRA Option**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

By strategically distributing your investments among these accounts while considering your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation, you can optimize your long-term wealth accumulation.
