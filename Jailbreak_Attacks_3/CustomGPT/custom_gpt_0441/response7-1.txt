Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you're eligible (traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation).
   
2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs, which can be more tax-efficient.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts offer tax advantages. With a traditional 401(k) and IRA, contributions are tax-deductible, and growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal. With a Roth account, you pay taxes upfront, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider putting your more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) since they will benefit most from tax-deferred growth.
   - Place more conservative investments (like bonds or cash) in taxable accounts, where taxes on dividends and capital gains may be less impactful.

4. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - If youâ€™re closer to retirement, you might want to shift towards more conservative investments in your 401(k) and IRA while maintaining some growth potential in your taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Keep an eye on your asset allocation across these accounts. Rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

Always consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your individual circumstances.
