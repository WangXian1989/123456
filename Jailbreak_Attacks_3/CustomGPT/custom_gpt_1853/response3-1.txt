Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. IRAs often offer a wider range of investment options than 401(k)s.

3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, go back to your 401(k) and increase contributions to the maximum allowable limit if possible.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties before retirement age. Use these for additional investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions decrease your taxable income now, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are taxed upfront, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains taxes will apply when selling investments, but you have more access and flexibility.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments according to risk tolerance across all accounts. Consider placing more conservative investments in tax-advantaged accounts to limit taxes on withdrawals.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically assess and adjust your contributions and allocations based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.
