Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as that's essentially "free money." If you can, try to max out contributions. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50). Roth IRAs are ideal for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRAs) lower your taxable income now but tax you on withdrawals later. 
   - Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you’re currently in a lower tax bracket and expect to move to a higher one later.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Investment Goals**:
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stocks may be suitable for long-term growth, while bonds can provide stability.
   - A common rule of thumb is to subtract your age from 110 or 120 to determine the percentage of your portfolio to allocate to stocks; the remainder could go into bonds.

4. **Taxable Investment Account**:
   - These are best for funds you might need in the short term or for investments that generate tax-efficient returns, like index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower turnover and capital gains distributions.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments here to manage your tax liability.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Annually or biannually review your investments to ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your goals. Adjust contributions based on market conditions and personal circumstances.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you’re unsure, a certified financial planner can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

By thoughtfully balancing contributions across these accounts, you can optimize for growth while managing taxes and aligning with your retirement goals.
