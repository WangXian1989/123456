The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money" for your retirement.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing any employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA (if you're eligible). IRAs generally offer tax advantages that can be beneficial for long-term savings.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if youâ€™re age 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to a Traditional 401(k) or IRA are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now but will be taxed as ordinary income when you withdraw in retirement. Roth accounts (Roth IRA and Roth 401(k)) are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth accounts. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, a Traditional account may be more beneficial.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Retirement Goals**:
   - Younger individuals might lean more towards riskier investments in growth-oriented accounts, while those closer to retirement may want to focus on stability and income.

6. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional investments. Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be useful for short-term goals.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Over time, your asset allocation may drift due to market movements. Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your original investment strategy.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about the best strategy for your specific situation, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your financial goals.

Ultimately, the right distribution strategy is highly individualized, so consider your current financial position and future goals.
