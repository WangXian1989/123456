(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, including your goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Generally, consider prioritizing contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." After that, max out your IRA contributions to take advantage of tax benefits. If you still have funds available, you can then invest in your taxable accounts. In taxable accounts, focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to keep your tax liability lower. It's also wise to regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on your financial goals and market conditions.
