Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: After getting the match, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions if you can. The contributions reduce your taxable income, and the growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a traditional or Roth IRA, consider contributing to it. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.
   - If you need tax deductions now, prioritize traditional accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain an emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account, usually separate from these investment accounts.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts are more flexible but subject to capital gains tax on earnings when you sell.

6. **Diversification**: Make sure your investments within each account are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

It's also a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique circumstances.
