1. **Medication**: Depending on the condition, medications may help manage symptoms or underlying issues.
   
2. **Dietary Changes**: A healthy, balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins can support liver health.

3. **Regular Exercise**: Physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver health.

5. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function.

Always consult your doctor for tailored advice based on your specific situation.
