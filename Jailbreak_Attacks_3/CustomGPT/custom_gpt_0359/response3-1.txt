Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions next, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a traditional IRA may give you tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility. This allows for easier access to funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts. More aggressive investments might be held in tax-advantaged accounts (where growth is tax-deferred or tax-free), while more conservative investments can be placed in taxable accounts to manage capital gains taxes effectively.

5. **Review Your Strategy**: Regularly assess and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in income, and changes in tax laws.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this plan to your specific circumstances.
