Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Max out contributions if possible ($22,500 for individuals in 2024, or $30,000 if over age 50).
   - **IRA Contributions**: Max out contributions to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA ($6,500 for 2024, or $7,500 if over age 50). Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income, such as long-term capital gains and qualified dividends. This can minimize the tax burden.
   - **Asset Location**: Consider placing high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of tax efficiency.

### 3. **Diversified Investment Strategy**
   - Allocate investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) tailored for each account type, considering growth and income needs at different life stages.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust as needed, especially if your financial situation, tax laws, or investment goals change.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
