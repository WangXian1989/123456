Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.

2. **401(k)**:
   - **Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, and growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Considerations**: Look at fees and investment options.

3. **IRA**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Considerations**: Income limits may affect eligibility for tax-deductible contributions to a traditional IRA or contributions to a Roth IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Allows for easy access to funds without penalties.
   - **Tax Implications**: Investment gains are subject to capital gains tax; consider holding investments for over a year for lower rates.

5. **General Strategy**:
   - Prioritize contributions to the 401(k) to at least the employer match.
   - Consider funding an IRA (preferably a Roth IRA if you qualify) next for its tax benefits.
   - Allocate additional investments to taxable accounts for flexibility and potentially higher returns on long-term investments.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and timeline by periodically reviewing and adjusting your investments.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances and goals.
