To optimize your investment distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax deductions.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), where you wonâ€™t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate interest or dividends, which are taxed in the year they're received.

3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - When planning for withdrawals in retirement, consider the tax implications. Typically, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your portfolio and adjust your allocations as needed based on changes in performance, risks, and your personal financial situation.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

This diversified approach can help minimize taxes and maximize growth potential over time.
