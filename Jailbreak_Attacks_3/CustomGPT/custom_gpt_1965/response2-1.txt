When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies for optimal results:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you can, contribute up to the limit, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investment flexibility and short-term goals. They are good for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds or ETFs).

4. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Hold assets likely to appreciate (stocks) or generate high levels of income (bonds).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, like funds with low turnover.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments within each account type to manage risk effectively.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Align your investments with your timeline. Longer timelines can handle more risk.

7. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess your allocations based on market performance and your financial goals.

By effectively allocating your contributions and considering tax implications, you can maximize your retirement savings and investment growth.
