Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available; this is essentially free money.
  
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After getting the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA for tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: Once IRAs are funded, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Lastly, if you have additional funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate them to taxable investment accounts. This is especially useful for short-term goals or if you plan to access funds before retirement age.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts, including a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments that align with your risk tolerance.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review your allocations and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your financial goals and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your individual situation.
