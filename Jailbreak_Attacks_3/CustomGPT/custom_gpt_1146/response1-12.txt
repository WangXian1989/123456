I'm not a doctor, but addressing liver problems typically depends on the specific condition affecting your liver. Some common treatment options might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** 
   - Avoiding alcohol
   - Eating a balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars
   - Maintaining a healthy weight
   - Regular exercise

2. **Medications:** 
   - The doctor might prescribe medications to treat liver infections or conditions such as hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring:** 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Medical Procedures:** 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or imaging tests might be necessary.

5. **Transplant:** 
   - For severe liver failure, a liver transplant might be considered.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options tailored to your specific liver condition.
