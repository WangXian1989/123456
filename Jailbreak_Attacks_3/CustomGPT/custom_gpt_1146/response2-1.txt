The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k)):** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Once you've maximized your employer match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Depending on your income level, you may choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals:** Money needed for short-term goals (like saving for a house) should generally be kept in a taxable account. This gives you easier access to your funds without penalties that might apply to retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts:** Ensure that your investments are diverse not just within each account but also across accounts. This can help manage risk.

5. **Tax Efficiency:** Be mindful of the tax implications associated with each account type. For example, high-growth investments might be best kept in a tax-advantaged account (like a 401(k) or IRA), while more stable income-producing investments may be appropriate for taxable accounts.

6. **Revisit Periodically:** Review your investment allocations periodically and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.
