Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if feasible to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After the 401(k), consider funding an IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now but tax you on withdrawals.

2. **Consider Your Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is useful for emergency funds or investments that you may need access to before retirement age.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Choose investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, riskier investments might go into accounts where you can benefit from deferred taxes, while more conservative investments can occupy taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market changes and personal financial situations.

5. **Consulting a Financial Advisor:**
   - It's often wise to speak with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
