It's important to consider several factors when deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions to these accounts may reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute, particularly if they're traditional accounts. Roth accounts (Roth IRA, Roth 401(k)) involve after-tax contributions but offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts do not provide tax benefits but offer greater flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   Distributing your investments across these accounts allows you to diversify your portfolio in different tax environments, which can improve your long-term investment strategy.

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-term Goals:**
   Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a separate savings account. If you have short-term financial goals (within 1-5 years), consider keeping those funds in a taxable account for easier access.

5. **Evaluate Your Financial Goals:**
   Depending on your goals—retirement, buying a house, education—you may prioritize contributions differently. For retirement, focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts first.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   Your financial situation may change, so regularly review your allocation and make adjustments as needed based on your goals, performance, and age.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances and financial goals.
