When it comes to distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there isn't a one-size-fits-all answer; the best strategy will depend on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. However, here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Plan:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Considerations:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current and expected future tax rates, you may choose one over the other.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits and consider fully funding your IRA for tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts provide more liquidity and access to your funds without penalties before retirement age, making them useful for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on strategies that minimize taxes in taxable accounts, such as holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

**General Distribution Strategy:**
- **Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first, especially if there's an employer match.**
- **Assess your overall asset allocation to ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts.**
- **Review your tax situation annually to adjust contributions based on income fluctuations or changes in your financial goals.**

It's wise to periodically review your investment strategy and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
