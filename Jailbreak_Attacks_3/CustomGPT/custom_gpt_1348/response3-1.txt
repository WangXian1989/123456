To best distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies, tailored to your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, meaning they lower your taxable income now, but you will pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account; can be traditional (tax-deductible contributions, taxed on withdrawals) or Roth (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments outside of retirement accounts, subject to capital gains taxes upon selling assets.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for the 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Prioritize Tax Benefits**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, traditional IRA or 401(k) contributions may be more beneficial.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments to spread risk. Include a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Expenses**: 401(k) plans often have higher fees than IRAs or taxable accounts. Be mindful of expense ratios and try to choose low-cost investment options.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level across all accounts.

7. **Plan for Withdrawals**: In retirement, consider the order of withdrawals. Typically, itâ€™s advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA), and lastly, Roth accounts for tax-free growth.

8. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider working with a financial advisor who can help create a tailored strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

In summary, systematically allocate your money by maximizing employer matches in your 401(k), using IRAs for tax benefits based on personal tax situations, and strategically investing in taxable accounts for flexibility. Regularly review your plan and consult with professionals as needed.
