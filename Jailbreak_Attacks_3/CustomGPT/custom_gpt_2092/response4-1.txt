Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates when choosing between these.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t have the same tax advantages but offer flexibility. They may be preferable for short-term goals since you can access the funds without penalties.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside before investing heavily in these accounts. This should cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Diversification**: Within each account type, ensure you diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

5. **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on growth-oriented investments in accounts with tax advantages (like 401(k) and IRA), while possibly holding more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage short-term cash needs.

6. **Regular Reassessment**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on changing financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a distribution strategy specific to your situation.
