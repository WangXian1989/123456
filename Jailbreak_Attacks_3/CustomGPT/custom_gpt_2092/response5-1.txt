To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like the 401(k) and IRA before putting money into taxable accounts. This helps your investments grow tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of Roth accounts).

3. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

4. **Diversification Strategy**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Typically, riskier investments (like stocks) can be best held in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments (like bonds) can be in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how and when you'll withdraw funds. For example, you might want to draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and performance. Adjust based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: If you're unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor an investment strategy to your specific needs.

This balanced approach can optimize your wealth accumulation while minimizing tax liabilities.
