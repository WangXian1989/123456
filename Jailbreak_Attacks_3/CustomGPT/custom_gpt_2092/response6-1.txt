To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**
   - **Max out employer match in your 401(k)**: Ensure you contribute enough to get the full employer matching contribution, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRAs**: Depending on your eligibility, prioritize contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA where possible to take advantage of tax benefits.

### 2. **Diversify Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Typically limited investment options; use it for long-term growth assets like stocks.
   - **IRA**: Offers more investment flexibility; consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Utilize this for more liquid, easily accessible funds; consider holding investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for better tax treatment.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Taxable accounts**: Use these for short-term needs or emergencies, as withdrawals are not subject to penalties.
   - **Retirement accounts**: Focus on these for long-term growth; aim to leave them untouched until retirement to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure diversification and alignment with your goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions among these accounts based on tax implications, immediate needs, and long-term growth potential is crucial. Adjust as your financial situation and market conditions change.
