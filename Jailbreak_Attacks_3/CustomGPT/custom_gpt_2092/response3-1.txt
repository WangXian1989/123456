Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential matching contributions. Offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Individual retirement accounts; Traditional offers tax-deferred growth, while Roth provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Non-retirement accounts where investment earnings are subject to capital gains tax, but offer more flexibility.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Max out 401(k) match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as it’s essentially “free money.”
   - **Fund an IRA**: After maximizing your match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages.
   - **Additional 401(k) contributions**: If you still have funds available, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investment beyond retirement accounts, focusing on goals with shorter timelines.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax efficiency**: Place investments that produce high taxable income (e.g., bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and growth-oriented investments (e.g., stocks) in taxable accounts if you expect to hold them long-term.
   - **Withdrawal strategies**: Plan your withdrawals in retirement to minimize tax liabilities, potentially withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

### 4. **Evaluate Risk Tolerance and Goals**
   - Your asset allocation should reflect your risk tolerance and investment goals. Younger investors might favor growth-oriented investments, while those nearing retirement might prioritize preservation.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustments**
   - Regularly review your investment allocations and performance, adjusting as needed based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach customized to your unique situation will yield the best results. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
