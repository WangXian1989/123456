Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering a few key factors, such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to help guide your distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income level, you may be eligible to contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be particularly advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 401(k) and traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, meaning you won’t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal. Roth IRAs, however, allow for tax-free growth, which can be beneficial depending on your current and expected future tax situation.

4. **Balance Your Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you’re diversified to reduce risk. A mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets can help balance your portfolio.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: If you've maxed out your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts are flexible and allow you to access your money without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on earned income.

6. **Adjust Based on Life Stage**: Younger investors might prefer growth-focused investments, while those nearing retirement may want to transition to more stable, income-producing investments.

7. **Regularly Reassess**: Financial goals, tax laws, and personal circumstances change, so it’s wise to review and adjust your allocations regularly.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
