It's important to consider various factors when deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some key points to help guide your decision:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions to your IRA if you are eligible. This can provide significant tax benefits.

2. **Understand the Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA are usually tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes when you withdraw the money in retirement. Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals, so consider your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - Taxable accounts do not have those tax advantages but offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals.

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - 401(k) plans may have limited investment options. Be sure to choose funds that align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - IRAs typically offer a wider range of investments. Use this flexibility to optimize your portfolio.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Think about your financial needs. Funds in a 401(k) or IRA usually incur penalties for early withdrawal, while taxable accounts provide more liquidity.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Place investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.
   - Keep investments with favorable long-term capital gains treatment (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance if necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can help create a personalized strategy based on your particular financial situation and goals.

Overall, the best approach often involves a combination of maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts while also maintaining some liquidity in taxable accounts. Adjust your strategy as your financial situation or goals change.
