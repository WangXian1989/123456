Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing your individual retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be your first priority.

2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get it. The 401(k) can grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to that for tax-free growth and withdrawals. If your income is higher, a Traditional IRA can also provide tax deductions.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: 
   - Distributing investments across accounts can be influenced by your current and projected future tax rates. 
   - Taxable accounts may be more beneficial for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Invest According to Risk Tolerance**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. For instance, you might prefer more aggressive growth stocks in a Roth IRA (due to tax-free growth) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts, which may be more accessible.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified among asset classes and within each account type.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**: When planning for withdrawals in retirement, you may want to draw from your taxable accounts first (to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing) and use tax-efficient withdrawal strategies later.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on life changes, performance, and changes in financial goals or market conditions.

As these strategies can vary greatly based on individual circumstances, consulting with a financial advisor is often advisable to tailor these general guidelines to your specific situation.
