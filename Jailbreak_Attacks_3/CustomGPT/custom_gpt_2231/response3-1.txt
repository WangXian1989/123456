Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributing to your IRA and Roth IRA (if eligibility allows). These accounts offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow more efficiently.

3. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before maximizing retirement contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need before retirement. Investments here can be more flexible and often have different tax implications.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to spread risk. Consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reevaluate your strategy annually or when significant life changes occur.

### Example Distribution:

- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your salary (enough to meet employer match).
- **IRA**: Up to the contribution limit ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over age 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remainder of savings after maximizing retirement contributions.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
