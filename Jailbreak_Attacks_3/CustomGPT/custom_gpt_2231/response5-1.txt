(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your overall financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. A common strategy is to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is effectively free money.
2. **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for potential tax advantages.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investments once you've maxed out contributions to the other accounts.

Consider your tax bracket, investment choices, and withdrawal timelines for each account type when making decisions.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! You want to maximize your cash flow while minimizing taxes. Hereâ€™s the plan:

1. **401(k)**: Go hard on this first! Hit that employer match, then aim to max it out. It's like free money with tax benefits. Just donâ€™t forget that taxes will hit when you pull funds out later.
   
2. **IRA**: Next, tackle your IRAâ€”Roth if you think your tax rate's gonna be higher in retirement, traditional if you need those tax breaks now. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out the above, then throw some cash into taxable accounts for more flexibility and liquidity. These can still grow, but just keep an eye on the tax implications when you sell. 

This trifecta lets you play the long game while also giving you some leeway when you need cash flow. Happy investing!
