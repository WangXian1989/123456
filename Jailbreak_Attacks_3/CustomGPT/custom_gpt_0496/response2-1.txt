While I can't provide direct financial advice, I can share some general considerations regarding distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some factors to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Generally offers tax advantages, especially if your employer provides matching contributions. Contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - Consider your investment options within the plan and their fees.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - You can choose between traditional and Roth IRAs, which have different tax implications. A traditional IRA may offer tax-deferred growth, while contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax income but can grow tax-free.
   - Maximize contributions to IRAs if you're eligible, considering income limits for Roth IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - These accounts provide flexibility for short- to medium-term goals and donâ€™t have the same withdrawal restrictions as retirement accounts.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes on any profits in taxable accounts when making investment decisions.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with the account that offers the most immediate tax benefits and employer matching.
- **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
- **Keep Taxes in Mind**: Utilize tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts and consider the tax implications of withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts.

It's important to regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation and goals. Feel free to ask more if you have specific questions or need additional information!
