When considering how to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to weigh several factors based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general overview to guide your decision:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, it's often wise to contribute enough to take full advantage of this match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) and a Roth IRA (taxed up front, tax-free withdrawals in retirement) based on your current tax situation and expected tax rate in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, which can be useful for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Consider the tax implications for capital gains and dividends when investing in taxable accounts, as these are subject to taxation each year.

### General Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer Match:** Start with the 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing any matching contributions, consider contributing to an IRA, focusing on a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
- **Use Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings:** If you have excess funds after maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts, especially if you anticipate needing those funds before retirement.

This approach effectively balances immediate tax benefits, long-term growth, and flexibility. It's also beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific financial situation and goals.
