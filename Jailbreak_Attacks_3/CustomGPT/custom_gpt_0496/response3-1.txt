Determining the best distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider for an optimal strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), consider contributing enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Assess Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on that money until you withdraw it in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxable in the year they are realized.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Consider keeping more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) where your gains can grow without immediate tax consequences.
   - More conservative investments (like bonds or stable funds) might be better suited for taxable accounts since they generate interest income that is taxed annually.

4. **Plan for Withdrawals**: When you reach retirement age, consider your withdrawal strategy. Typically, it may make sense to withdraw from taxable accounts first, to let tax-advantaged accounts continue to grow.

5. **Revisit Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals can change, so it's important to review and adjust your allocation periodically.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Since individual circumstances vary significantly, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
