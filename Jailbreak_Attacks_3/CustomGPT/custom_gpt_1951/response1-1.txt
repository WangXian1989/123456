Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general considerations to help you determine the best allocation:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, maximizing your 401(k) can be beneficial.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Types of IRAs:** Decide between a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). The choice depends on whether you prefer tax benefits now or later.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the contribution limits and ensure you're maximizing these if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices. Use them for short-term goals or if you want access to your money before retirement age without penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

**Asset Allocation Strategy:**
- **Risk Tolerance:** Consider how much risk you're comfortable with and diversify your investments accordingly across accounts.
- **Time Horizon:** The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative your investments should be, especially in your 401(k) and IRAs.
- **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

**Consult a Financial Advisor:** It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation. They can help you create a comprehensive plan that reflects your unique goals and circumstances.
