The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before distributing funds to other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth), which can reduce your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed (for traditional accounts). The Roth variant offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth. Be aware of income limits for Roth IRA contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxable in the year they are realized. However, you have more flexibility with withdrawals.

3. **Investment Horizon**:
   - If you are investing for long-term goals (like retirement), focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first.
   - For shorter-term goals, consider using taxable accounts for more liquid and accessible investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Keep in mind the types of investments you hold in each account. Generally, higher-growth investments (like stocks) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower expected returns or those that generate more taxable events (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks).

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Make sure your overall portfolio maintains a balance that matches your risk tolerance. This might mean having a different asset allocation in your taxable account compared to your retirement accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust your distributions based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or investment performance.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor your investment strategy to your unique circumstances.
