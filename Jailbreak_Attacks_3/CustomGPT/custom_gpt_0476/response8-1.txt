The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), consider contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (or after-tax for a Roth 401(k)), which can lower your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this could be beneficial.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a traditional or Roth IRA, you'll either get a tax deduction now (traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth). Consider maxing out contributions to these accounts, as they offer significant tax advantages.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future, contributing to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) might be advantageous. Conversely, if you're in a higher bracket now and expect to be in a lower one during retirement, traditional accounts may offer better benefits.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexible Investments**: Taxable accounts don’t have contribution limits like retirement accounts, and they allow for withdrawals at any time without penalties. They are good for investments that may appreciate rapidly, as long-term capital gains taxes are generally lower than ordinary income tax rates.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across your accounts, as overly concentrating assets in one type of account can increase risks.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan ahead for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. This can influence how you allocate funds now; for example, you may want to keep certain assets in taxable accounts for early retirement withdrawals.

7. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your distribution as your income, expenses, and financial goals change over time.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your personal circumstances.
