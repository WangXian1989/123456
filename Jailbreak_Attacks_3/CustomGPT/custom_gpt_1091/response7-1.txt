Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Roth or Traditional IRAs**
   - **Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. This allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, contributing to a traditional IRA could provide tax savings now.

### 3. **Continue Funding 401(k)**
   - After maxing out the employer match and contributing to an IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k), especially if you can contribute the maximum allowable amount.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might be needed before retirement or for short-to-medium-term goals. 
   - Consider holding investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs) in these accounts to minimize capital gains tax.

### 5. **Debt and Emergency Fund Consideration**
   - Ensure high-interest debts are paid off before heavily funding investment accounts.
   - Maintain a solid emergency fund to avoid withdrawing from retirement accounts prematurely.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your goals and any changes in your financial situation.

### 7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're uncertain about your strategy, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your income, expenses, and goals.

This strategy should give you a balanced approach, allowing for tax advantages while still providing flexibility and access to funds when needed.
