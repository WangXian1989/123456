1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications can include antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Management of Underlying Conditions**: Effective management of diabetes, obesity, or high cholesterol can be beneficial.

4. **Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsies or surgeries might be necessary.

5. **Liver Transplant**: For end-stage liver disease, a transplant may be considered.

It's vital to work closely with a healthcare provider to determine the best plan for your specific condition.
