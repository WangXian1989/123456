Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:** 
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also provide potential tax deductions for contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Capital gains and dividends are taxed, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Diversify Across Accounts:** 
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) primarily for long-term growth investments like stocks and mutual funds.
   - Keep more conservative investments, like bonds or cash equivalents, in taxable accounts to better manage tax implications on withdrawals.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personal circumstances can significantly influence the best approach, so consider professional advice tailored to your situation.

Be sure to consider any contribution limits and tax implications associated with each account type to optimize your strategy.
