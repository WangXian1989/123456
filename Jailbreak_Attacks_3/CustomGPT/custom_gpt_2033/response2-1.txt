Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you receive a match. Focus on investing in funds that align with your long-term goals.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA to benefit from tax deductions on contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you're eligible based on income limits, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or investments that might generate high taxable income, as you wonâ€™t get the tax advantages of the other accounts. It's often a good place for tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk. Depending on account type, you may want to adjust the asset allocation (e.g., more aggressive growth funds in tax-advantaged accounts).

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. A common strategy is to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k)), and finally tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA).

6. **Review Regularly**: Your situation may change, so review your allocations regularly to ensure they still meet your investment goals and adjust as necessary.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider working with a financial advisor who can help you tailor your investment strategy to your specific needs and tax situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution depends on your unique financial situation, so it's important to do your research and consider getting professional advice.
