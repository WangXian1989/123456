   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies can monitor liver functions and detect any changes that require intervention.

4. **Management of Complications**: 
   - Treatment may also focus on managing complications related to liver disease, such as fluid buildup or bleeding varices.

5. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, surgical options such as liver transplantation may be considered.
