Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, time horizon, and tax considerations. Here are some guidelines to consider for optimal distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and access to funds. These can be beneficial for shorter-term goals or for tax-efficient investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts. Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher growth investments (like stocks) and keep more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing from these accounts. 401(k) and Traditional IRA withdrawals are typically taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and performance, making adjustments as needed based on market conditions and your changing financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider working with a financial advisor who can tailor a distribution strategy based on your specific circumstances and goals.

Balancing these accounts wisely can help you maximize growth and minimize taxes over time.
