(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to capture the full match, as it's essentially free money. Typically, you should aim to maximize your contributions if possible, as 401(k) plans offer tax-deferred growth and potential tax benefits.

2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions (depending on your income) and tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your choice will depend on your current tax bracket versus expected tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, you can then focus on taxable investment accounts. These accounts provide liquidity and allow you to access your funds without incurring early withdrawal penalties. However, be mindful of the tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

It's often beneficial to balance contributions based on your financial goals, tax situation, and when you expect to need the funds.

You want to spread the love between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts based on what makes the most sense for you. Here's the game plan:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer is throwing in free money with a match, you better jump on that â€“ it's like getting instant pizza at a party, you donâ€™t want to miss out! Max it out if you can because that tax-deferred growth is your friend.

2. **IRA**: Next up, tune in to your IRA. Youâ€™ve got a choice between traditional and Roth â€“ the former might save you bucks now, while the latter will be your golden goose later. Aim to max it if you can swing it because those tax perks are sweet.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, after you've stuffed your 401(k) and IRA, look at your taxable accounts. These are great for flexibility. Want to cash out for a shindig or a sweet gadget? You can do that here without penalties. Just keep an eye on the tax bill for those gains.

In the end, itâ€™s all about mixing it up according to your goals, what you expect down the road, and how much risk youâ€™re willing to take. Plan that party wisely!
