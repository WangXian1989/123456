Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough to get the full employer match** if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - Consider **maxing out your IRA** first (traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax strategy).
   - If you're under 50, the limit for 2024 is $6,500 for IRAs. For 401(k)s, the limit is $23,000.
   - **Roth IRAs** are excellent if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Again, traditional IRAs grow tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they're realized.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - In your **401(k) and IRA**, diversify between stocks, bonds, and alternative investments based on your risk tolerance.
   - Use your **taxable account** for investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or municipal bonds.

### 5. **Balance According to Your Goals**
   - If youâ€™re saving for **retirement**, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - If you have short- to medium-term goals (like buying a house), consider keeping money in a taxable account for easier access.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Periodically review your allocation based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial situation.

### 7. **Consider Professional Advice**
   - Depending on your situation, consulting with a financial advisor might help you create a tailored investment strategy.

This approach balances tax advantages, growth potential, and access to funds when needed.
