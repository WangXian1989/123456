Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**: If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA can offer tax deductions now.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility & Accessibility**: Contributions to taxable accounts can be withdrawn without penalties, making them useful for shorter-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on long-term investments to benefit from lower capital gains taxes; consider tax-efficient funds.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before allocating funds to retirement accounts.
- **60/40 Split** (A common strategy for retirement savings):
  - **60%** in 401(k) and IRAs (maximize tax benefits).
  - **40%** in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

### Regular Review and Adjustments
- Monitor your asset allocation and adjust annually based on changes in income, market performance, or life circumstances.

Before making any decisions, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
