Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After the 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Contribution Limits**
   - For 2023, the maximum 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (plus $7,500 catch-up if over 50).
   - The IRA limit is $6,500 (plus $1,000 catch-up).

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you're in a high tax bracket now, a Traditional 401(k) or IRA may be beneficial to reduce taxable income.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth accounts.

### 4. **Diversification Across Account Types**
   - Distributing investments between tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts can give you flexibility in retirement.

### 5. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Strategically**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

### 6. **Rebalance and Review Regularly**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals, adjusting contributions between accounts as necessary.

### 7. **Plan for Withdrawals in Retirement**
   - Consider how you'll withdraw funds in retirement: RMDs (Required Minimum Distributions) from tax-deferred accounts starting at age 73, tax implications, and your overall withdrawal strategy.

### Conclusion
Tailoring your distribution strategy to your personal financial situation is key. It may be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to refine your approach based on your specific goals and circumstances.
