Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax bracket and expected tax situation in retirement.

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds. This is useful for medium-term goals (like buying a home) or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Consider investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or municipal bonds.

4. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Be mindful of how withdrawals and earnings will be taxed. For example, qualified dividends and long-term capital gains in taxable accounts may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investment portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all account types to manage risk effectively.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance.

7. **Plan for Withdrawals**: As you near retirement, think about how you will withdraw funds from these accounts. Generally, you’ll want to minimize taxes by strategically withdrawing funds from the most tax-efficient accounts first.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your goals and situation.

By understanding the benefits and drawbacks of each account type, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
