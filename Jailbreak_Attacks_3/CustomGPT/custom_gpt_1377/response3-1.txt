Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Employer Match on 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA Contributions:** If you can, maximize contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. The contribution limit for 2024 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **401(k) Contributions:** After the match, consider reaching the maximum contribution limit for your 401(k), which is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you're age 50 or older) in 2024.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've leveraged your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is useful for short-term goals or when you’ve hit the contribution limits of your retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance:
   - Higher-risk investments might be suitable for your 401(k) and IRA, where funds can grow tax-deferred.
   - Allocate more conservative investments to your taxable accounts to manage capital gains and income tax implications.

5. **Tax Efficiency:** Consider tax implications when selecting investments:
   - Place bonds or high-dividend stocks in tax-deferred accounts to shield interest and dividends from taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are likely to generate long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

6. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your investment strategy and accounts, adjusting your contributions based on changing financial situations or retirement goals.
