Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should align with your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** 
     - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** 
     - Maximize contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth accounts are better if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Allocate more toward tax-advantaged accounts if you're in a higher tax bracket. This helps you defer taxes on contributions (traditional accounts) or pay them now for tax-free growth (Roth accounts).

### 3. **Investment Horizon:**
   - Use 401(k) and IRA accounts for long-term investments, including stocks and mutual funds.
   - If funds are needed in the short term, consider keeping more liquidity in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Regularly adjust your allocations based on market performance and any changes in your financial situation.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to minimize risk.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help defer tax-deferred accounts for longer.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Age 20-40:** Focus on maxing out retirement accounts if possible (401(k), IRA), with secondary investments in taxable accounts.
- **Age 40-60:** Maintain contributions to retirement accounts while also increasing investments in taxable accounts as retirement approaches.
- **Age 60+:** Shift towards more conservative investments, possibly reallocating from growth to income-producing assets.

### Final Considerations:
- Consult with a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation for personalized advice.
