Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful strategy. Hereâ€™s a solid approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match; this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**
   - **Tax Benefits**: Depending on your situation (Roth vs. Traditional), IRA contributions may offer valuable tax advantages. Aim to max out contributions if you can.

### 3. **Fund 401(k) to Annual Limit**
   - **Higher Limits**: After your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This allows for significant tax-advantaged growth.

### 4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Savings Goals**
   - **Flexibility**: For shorter-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement, utilize taxable accounts. This offers more liquidity.

### 5. **Consider Asset Allocation**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Stocks, bonds, and other assets should be allocated according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 6. **Monitor and Adjust Regularly**
   - **Rebalance**: Periodically review your investment strategy and make adjustments based on changing goals, market conditions, or tax laws.

### Conclusion
By following these steps, you can strategically grow your investments while maximizing tax efficiency.
