Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching funds, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max out your IRA** (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet certain conditions.
   - Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit once you've maxed out your IRA.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to a Traditional IRA and 401(k) are typically tax-deductible, reducing your current taxable income.
   - Withdrawals from these accounts are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax on profits, but they offer flexibility and can be beneficial for long-term gains.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a separate savings account.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Reassess your distribution strategy annually or when your financial situation changes.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage your investments for long-term growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
