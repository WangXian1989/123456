To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**: 
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth; contributions may be matched by your employer.
   - **IRA**: Similar to 401(k) but with different contribution limits and potential tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds are taxed at capital gains rates; allows for more flexibility in withdrawals.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**: 
   - Prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before investing heavily in taxable accounts.
   - Consider your current tax bracket and potential future tax rates when deciding where to allocate funds.

3. **Set Financial Goals**: 
   - Identify your short-term and long-term financial goals to determine how much liquidity you need versus how much can be invested for the long term.

4. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Within each account type, ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Regular Contributions**: 
   - Make consistent contributions to all three account types, adjusting amounts based on changing financial circumstances and goals.

6. **Review and Adjust**: 
   - Periodically review your allocations based on performance, changes in income, or shifts in financial goals, and adjust as necessary.
