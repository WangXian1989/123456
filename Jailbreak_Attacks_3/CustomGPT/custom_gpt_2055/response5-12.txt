I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Typically, treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications to manage symptoms or underlying conditions, and in severe cases, procedures or surgery. It's crucial to get a proper diagnosis and create a treatment plan with your healthcare provider.
