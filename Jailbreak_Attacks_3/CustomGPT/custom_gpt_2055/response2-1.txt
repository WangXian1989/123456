The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. Taxes are due upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth (if qualified) on contributions made with after-tax dollars.

3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: 
   - For 2023, the maximum contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older). Ensure you fully utilize these limits if feasible.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for flexibility. This can be beneficial for accessing your money before retirement without penalties. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across these accounts to balance growth and risk. Consider different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and investment strategies based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Annually**: Review your asset allocation and adjust as needed to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, working with a financial advisor can provide clarity.

Overall, a balanced approach that takes tax implications and your financial goals into account will help you make informed decisions about distributing your money among these accounts.
