To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:  
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**: Traditional IRAs follow the same tax rules as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement after meeting certain conditions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are subject to capital gains tax, but you can access your money anytime without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:  
   - Assess your short-term vs. long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for more accessible funds, while prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments.

3. **Contribution Limits**:  
   - Max out contributions for 401(k) and IRA (especially if employer matches in 401(k)) before investing heavily in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification Strategies**:  
   - Consider asset allocation based on risk tolerance and investment horizon. Balance stocks, bonds, and other assets appropriately across all accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:  
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement, keeping tax implications in mind.

Taking these factors into account helps create an effective distribution strategy for your investments. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
