The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) next, as they offer tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate money to taxable accounts for additional investing flexibility and liquidity.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts may be beneficial for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across all accounts to reduce risk.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Regularly review your investment strategy and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial planner to tailor a strategy that suits your personal circumstances.
