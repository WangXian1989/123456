I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems, as they can provide tailored advice based on your specific condition. Treatment options may vary depending on the diagnosis, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common recommendations might include lifestyle changes like adopting a healthy diet, engaging in regular exercise, reducing alcohol consumption, and addressing any underlying health issues. Always seek guidance from a medical expert to ensure you receive the most appropriate care.
