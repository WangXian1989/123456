When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider a few factors, such as your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment time horizon. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how to approach this:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), which can reduce your taxable income now or allow for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Investment Selection:** Choose a diversified mix of investments available in your 401(k) plan.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** Decide on a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed on withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Contribution Limits:** Stay within annual contribution limits. For 2023, it’s $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50).
   - **Tax Strategy:** Consider the tax implications of your current income and your expected income in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Money in taxable accounts can be withdrawn at any time without penalty. This is a good option for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Capital Gains:** Be mindful of how taxes on capital gains will impact your returns. Consider holding assets for the long term to minimize taxes.
   - **Diversification:** Use this account for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, such as individual stocks or mutual funds.

### **General Strategy:**
- **Prioritize Contributions:** Start with maximizing the employer match in your 401(k) first, then consider IRA contributions, and finally, fill taxable accounts as needed.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### **Conclusion:**
There’s no one-size-fits-all answer, and it’s highly beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your unique circumstances.

Remember, it's important to keep an eye on the fees associated with each account type and consider investing in low-cost index funds or ETFs when possible. Happy investing!
