To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize tax-deferred accounts first**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money and enhances your overall investment.
   - **Prioritize your IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Investment Goals & Liquidity Needs**:
   - **Short-term needs**: Use taxable accounts for money you may need in the near future, as these accounts allow for easier access.
   - **Long-term growth**: Allocate more funds to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs for retirement, where your investments can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

3. **Diversification**:
   - **Asset distribution**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Spread different asset types (stocks, bonds, funds) to minimize risk and maximize returns.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, risk tolerance, and changing financial goals.

By strategically planning your contributions and withdrawals, you can optimize your overall tax position and grow your wealth effectively.
