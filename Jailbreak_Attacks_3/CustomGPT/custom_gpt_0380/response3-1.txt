Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income level.

3. **Fill Up Your 401(k)**: If you're able to, contribute the maximum to your 401(k). This not only reduces your taxable income for the year but also allows for higher contribution limits compared to an IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that have a lower expected tax burden, such as index funds or long-term investments. Avoid holding bonds or other high-income-generating assets in these accounts due to higher tax implications.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets reflecting your risk tolerance and time until retirement.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation.
