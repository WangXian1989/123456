Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute as much as possible (up to the annual limit) if you're in a high tax bracket now, since contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Fund this if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investments beyond your retirement accounts. This is useful for short-term goals and offers more flexibility.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Consider Fees**: Be mindful of any fees associated with your 401(k) plan and choose investments with lower costs if available.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on changes in your financial situation and goals.

Tailoring your approach based on your specific circumstances, such as income level, retirement timeline, and market performance, is crucial for optimal distribution. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies.
