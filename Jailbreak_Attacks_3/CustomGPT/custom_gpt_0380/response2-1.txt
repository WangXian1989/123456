The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some principles to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match before directing funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (for tax-free growth and withdrawals) or a Traditional IRA (for tax-deductible contributions).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax. Consider holding tax-efficient investments here since you pay taxes on dividends and gains annually.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Higher income investments (like bonds) may be better suited for your 401(k) or IRA since growth within these accounts is tax-deferred until withdrawal.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of which account type you are using. 

4. **Rebalancing Regularly**:
   - As your investments grow and market conditions change, periodically check and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Longer time horizons may warrant a more aggressive allocation towards stocks, while shorter horizons should lean towards more conservative investments to protect against market volatility.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure, a professional can help tailor a plan specific to your financial situation and goals.

In summary, prioritize contributing to tax-advantaged accounts (especially to the point of employer match), understand tax implications for each account type, maintain a diversified portfolio, and consider your investment horizon in your strategy.
