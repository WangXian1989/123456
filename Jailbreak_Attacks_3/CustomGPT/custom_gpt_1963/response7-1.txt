Certainly! Here’s a balanced approach to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match first (this is essentially free money).
   - Aim to maximize your contributions if possible (the limit for 2024 is $23,000 if under 50).

2. **IRA Contributions**: 
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.
   - The limit for 2024 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use these for additional savings once you’ve maxed out your retirement accounts.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Tips:
- **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to manage risk.
- **Rebalance Annually**: Adjust your portfolio to align with your long-term investment goals.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help optimize your specific situation.

By prioritizing contributions this way, you can maximize growth while minimizing taxes.
