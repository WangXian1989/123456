Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Max out IRA contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Further fund your 401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit after maximizing your IRA.

### 3. **Assess Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments not suitable for tax-advantaged accounts, such as certain short-term trading strategies or specific stock positions. 

### 4. **Consider Asset Location**
   - **Place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts** (like stocks in your IRA or 401(k)).
   - **Hold income-generating assets in taxable accounts** (like bonds) to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax.

### 5. **Regularly Rebalance**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Professional**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial circumstances, consider consulting a financial advisor.

### Conclusion
Each person’s situation is unique, so tailor these strategies to meet your individual needs and long-term objectives.
