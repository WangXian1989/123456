To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**: 
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions, potential employer match, grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Either traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but offers flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (both traditional and Roth, if eligible). 

3. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**: 
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - If expecting higher future income, traditional accounts might be more beneficial.

4. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Use your 401(k) for long-term growth (stocks, funds) and bonds in your IRA to balance risk.
   - Keep more liquid investments in taxable accounts for access and potential capital gains advantages.

5. **Evaluate Liquidity Needs**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergencies while saving tax-advantaged accounts for retirement.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: 
   - Review and adjust your allocations to align with your risk tolerance and market conditions.
