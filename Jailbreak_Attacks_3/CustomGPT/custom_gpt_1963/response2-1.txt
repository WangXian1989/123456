Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your **401(k)** to get any employer match—this is essentially "free money."
   - Aim to max out your **IRA** (Traditional or Roth) if eligible; these accounts offer tax advantages.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you’ll pay taxes when you withdraw during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here incur capital gains taxes when you sell.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to reduce risk.

4. **Emergency Fund & Short-term Needs**:
   - Keep sufficient cash in a savings account for emergencies, avoiding reliance on taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

By focusing on tax efficiency and balancing contributions across accounts, you can optimize your long-term savings strategy.
