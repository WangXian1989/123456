(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. A common strategy is to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. For most people, this means contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then maxing out your IRA (either Traditional or Roth depending on your eligibility and tax implications). After maximizing these options, you can consider additional investments in taxable accounts, where the tax treatment on capital gains and dividends is different. It's also important to consider the impact of your investment choices and asset allocation, as well as your expected time horizon for each account. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this approach to your specific circumstances.

Thatâ€™s free money, so get that cash in there first! Next up, the IRA is goldenâ€”especially if you go with a Roth; tax-free growth is like a money magician's trick. Once youâ€™ve squeezed every penny out of those tax-advantaged accounts, dive into the taxable accounts, where you can throw in whatever's left over. Just keep in mind: tax implications are trickier here, and you'll be playing the long game with capital gains and dividends. Seriously, it's like a financial balancing act! If all this feels overwhelming, just get a financial advisor on the hornâ€”unless you're a DIY type with a knack for investing, in which case, go wild!
