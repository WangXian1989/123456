When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your financial goals, tax implications, and the time horizon for your investments. Here are some steps to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding an IRA (whether traditional or Roth) to take advantage of potential tax benefits. The choice between traditional and Roth should depend on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: As a general rule, you may want to keep higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on gains. Conversely, consider holding investments that produce more taxable income (like bonds or REITs) in your taxable account.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. This means you should not overconcentrate in one type of asset in any single account.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**: Implement an asset location strategy where you place assets in the account that will likely yield the best after-tax returns. For example, consider placing bond funds in tax-advantaged accounts and equity funds in taxable accounts if you anticipate higher returns from equities over the long run.

6. **Liquidity Needs**: Assess your liquidity needs; funds in a taxable account can be accessed more readily without penalty compared to retirement accounts.

7. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review your overall allocation and make adjustments based on performance and changing financial goals. 

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategy for your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Ultimately, the ideal distribution will vary based on individual circumstances, including your risk tolerance, investment goals, and tax situation.
