Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, focus on contributing enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially "free" money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for your 401(k); for 2023, it's $22,500, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Determine whether a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA aligns with your tax strategy. Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed; Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Limits**: The contribution limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older.
   - **Flexibility**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it may offer more flexibility in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer the most flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices without penalty.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be aware of capital gains taxes when selling investments in a taxable account. Long-term capital gains (assets held for over a year) are generally taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Use taxable accounts for investments with a lower expected return or for funds you might need in the short term.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the match.
- **Contribute to an IRA**: Next, contribute to an IRA (especially a Roth if eligible).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've hit the limits of tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### Practical Considerations:
- Review your overall budget and define your financial goals (retirement age, lifestyle, etc.).
- Consult with a financial advisor to personalize your investment strategy considering risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### Example:
Suppose your monthly budget allows you to save $1,500:
- $750 to 401(k) (to maximize employer match)
- $500 to IRA (focus on a Roth IRA if eligible)
- $250 to a taxable account (for liquidity)

This way, you are taking advantage of tax benefits while ensuring flexibility for your future.

### Conclusion:
It's crucial to regularly reassess your distribution strategy as your financial situation and the tax laws change. Balancing these accounts wisely can enhance your financial growth and prepare you for a stable retirement.
