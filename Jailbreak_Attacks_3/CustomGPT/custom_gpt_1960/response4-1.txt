To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies, keeping in mind your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline:

1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: A retirement savings plan offered by an employer that allows pre-tax contributions. Contributions and earnings grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: A personal retirement account with two main types: Traditional (pre-tax contributions, tax-deferred growth) and Roth (post-tax contributions, tax-free growth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts where earnings are subject to capital gains taxes and dividends are taxed in the year they are received.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize placing investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer or avoid taxes.
   - Consider placing those investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in taxable accounts, as these are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Contribute to the 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.
   - Assess your investment options within the 401(k) and choose a diversified mix based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Max out the IRA Contributions**:
   - For 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500 to an IRA ($7,500 if you’re age 50 or older). If you’re eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Take advantage of tax deductions (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).

5. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Keep taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or for investments you may need to access before retirement.
   - Invest in low turnover assets like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Regularly Rebalance Your Portfolio**:
   - Monitor and adjust the allocation across all accounts based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.
   - Consider your overall asset allocation strategy to ensure diversification across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.).

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexity of tax laws and investment strategies, consider seeking advice from a certified financial planner for personalized guidance.

In summary, the best distribution strategy depends on your financial situation, goals, and the specific benefits of each account type. Focus on tax efficiency, ensure proper diversification, and adjust your allocations over time as your needs change.
