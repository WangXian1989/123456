(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Evaluate Investment Options**: Examine the investment choices available in your 401(k) and IRA accounts. Choose low-cost index funds or ETFs to minimize fees and maximize growth potential.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Utilize taxable accounts for investments that are expected to generate capital gains or income, as these can be taxed differently than retirement accounts. Consider holding assets like stocks in taxable accounts that benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Rebalance Annually**: Review your asset allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Rebalance your portfolio as needed.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! The best way to juggle your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is like a game of financial Tetrisâ€”stacking your blocks in the most efficient way possible. Hereâ€™s some killer advice:

1. **401(k) First**: Hit up your 401(k) like it's a bottomless brunch! Get that company matchâ€”it's FREE money, so why leave it on the table? After that, toss in more until you max out your contributions if you can.

2. **IRA Love**: Next up, slide into an IRA. Choose a Roth if you want to pay taxes now and enjoy tax-free growth later, or a traditional flick if you wanna save some bucks on taxes upfront. Go for max contributions here too!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Your taxable account is where you can keep it spicy! Invest in stocks or funds that can sit for the long term, benefitting from the lower capital gains tax. Just don't throw everything in thereâ€”keep it balanced!

4. **Watch and Adjust**: Keep an eye on your portfolio like itâ€™s your favorite show. Markets shift, and so should you! Rebalance that bad boy once a year to keep it in line with your goalsâ€”donâ€™t let it get out of whack!
