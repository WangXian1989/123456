To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: This is a retirement plan offered by employers that allows for pre-tax contributions. It often provides employer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: This account can be either traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax). A traditional IRA allows you to deduct contributions from your taxable income, whereas a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are regular investment accounts where you can invest money without the tax advantages of retirement accounts but have greater accessibility and flexibility.

2. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: 
   - Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer matching contributions first. For example, if your employer matches up to 5%, aim to contribute at least that amount.

3. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Efficiency**:
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement than you are currently, contribute to the traditional IRA or 401(k) for tax savings now.
   - If you anticipate a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later.

4. **Diversify Tax Strategies**:
   - A common strategy is to have a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA), tax-free (Roth IRA), and taxable accounts for flexibility and tax management in retirement.
   - This method allows you to strategically withdraw from accounts based on your tax situation each year.

5. **Consider Investment Opportunities**:
   - Depending on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon, allocate funds wisely among the different accounts. Generally, more aggressive investments may be preferred in tax-deferred accounts where growth is not taxed, while conservative investments may be more suitable for taxable accounts.

6. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: 
   - Keep in mind the contribution limits for 401(k) plans, IRAs, and make sure to maximize contributions within these limits.

7. **Adjust for Age and Retirement Timeline**:
   - Your age and how close you are to retirement may influence contributions. Younger investors may focus on growth, while those nearing retirement might lean towards preserving capital and protecting against risk.

8. **Review Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, investment performance, and life events.

It's recommended to consult a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your unique circumstances and fiscal goals.
