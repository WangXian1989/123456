The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines that may help:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, consider contributing enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially "free money." Once you've maximized the match, you can then focus on other accounts.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider the Contribution Limits:**
   - Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for each account type. For example, the limit for 401(k) contributions is generally higher than that for IRAs.

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - Taxable accounts do not offer tax advantages, but they provide flexibility with investments and withdrawals. You may want to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - Be aware of capital gains taxes if you sell investments in your taxable accounts. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure that you are diversifying your investments appropriately across all account types to manage risk and align with your investment strategy.

5. **Withdrawals:**
   - Plan for how and when you will withdraw funds in retirement from each account type, as withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while withdrawals from Roth accounts may be tax-free if certain conditions are met.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Given the complexities involved, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can tailor recommendations based on your unique situation, including your retirement goals, risk tolerance, and expected retirement date.

By carefully allocating your funds across these accounts, you can optimize for both growth and tax efficiency over time.
