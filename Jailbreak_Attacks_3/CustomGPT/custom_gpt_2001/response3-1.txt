Distributing money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts optimally requires consideration of several factors, including your age, retirement goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here's a strategic approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA:** If you can afford to save more after maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your eligibility, you might choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Consider Tax Advantages:** 
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income. However, you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future.

4. **After Tax Accounts:** Once you have maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility regarding withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:** Ensure your investments within each account are appropriately diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider factors like stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly:** Your financial needs and market conditions can change. Regularly review your distribution strategy to ensure it aligns with your current goals and circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you're unsure about the best approach for your specific situation, consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored guidance.

By strategically allocating your contributions based on the above factors, you can enhance your retirement savings while managing your tax implications effectively.
