To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**: Contributions to a 401(k) and a traditional IRA are often tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. In contrast, contributions to a Roth IRA are made after tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Taxable accounts do not provide tax advantages on contributions but can offer flexibility.

2. **Investment Goals**: Define your short-term and long-term investment goals. If you need liquidity for short-term goals, taxable accounts may be more appropriate. For long-term retirement goals, maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA can be beneficial.

3. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), consider contributing enough to maximize this benefit, as it is essentially "free money." 

4. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k) accounts (with an additional catch-up contribution for those aged 50 and over) and $6,500 for IRAs.

5. **Withdrawal Rules**: Understand the withdrawal rules related to each account. For instance, 401(k) and traditional IRA funds are subject to taxes upon withdrawal during retirement, while Roth IRA withdrawals can be tax-free if certain conditions are met.

6. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance. You can use each account for different investment strategies, such as putting more aggressive, high-growth investments in your tax-advantaged accounts and more stable, income-producing investments in taxable accounts.

7. **Future Tax Bracket Considerations**: Estimate your future tax bracket at retirement. If you expect to be in a higher bracket, consider maximizing tax-advantaged accounts now. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower bracket, you may choose to prioritize Roth contributions or taxable accounts for flexibility.

By balancing these factors, you can create a strategy that maximizes growth potential while managing tax implications. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation.
