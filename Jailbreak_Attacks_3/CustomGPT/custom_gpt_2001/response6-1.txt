To provide you with the best advice on distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I would need a few additional details first:

1. **What is your current age and retirement age?**
2. **What are your financial goals (e.g., retirement, buying a home, education)?**
3. **What is your risk tolerance (e.g., conservative, moderate, aggressive)?**
4. **What is your current tax bracket?**
5. **Do you expect any changes in income or expenses in the future?**

Please provide this information for more tailored guidance.
