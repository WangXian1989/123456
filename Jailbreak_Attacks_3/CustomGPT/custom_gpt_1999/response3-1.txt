Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Offers tax-deferred growth, often with employer match.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible access to funds, but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; this is free money.
   - **Max Out IRA:** After securing the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA.

### 3. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Focus on accounts that provide tax benefits for long-term growth (401(k) and IRAs).
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for goals with shorter time horizons since they offer more liquidity.

### 4. **Consider Your Age and Timeline**
   - Younger investors might prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for growth.
   - As you near retirement, consider reallocating to more stable investments in these accounts.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Utilize a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments across all accounts to balance risk and growth.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **Early Career (20s-30s):**
  - Maximize 401(k) up to match
  - Max IRA contributions (preferably Roth)
  - Use taxable accounts for additional investments

- **Mid-Career (40s-50s):**
  - Continue maximizing 401(k) and IRAs
  - Gradually increase contributions to taxable accounts for liquidity

- **Pre-Retirement (60s):**
  - Shift focus to capital preservation; consider more bonds and stable investments
  - Ensure you have enough in liquid accounts for near-term needs

### Conclusion
The best approach is personalized. Consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.
