Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: With a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, and withdrawals in retirement are taxed. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments. They provide flexibility for accessing funds before retirement age.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid account before aggressively investing.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Tax-advantaged accounts are often better for long-term growth investments, while taxable accounts can be used for more accessible, shorter-term needs.

5. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It can be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.

Consider these elements to find a distribution strategy that suits your individual needs.
