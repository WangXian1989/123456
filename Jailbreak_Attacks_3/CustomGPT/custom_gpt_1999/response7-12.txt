I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information about liver health and treatment options. The best course of treatment largely depends on the specific liver condition you're facing. Here are some common approaches based on various liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while avoiding alcohol and high-fat, processed foods can be beneficial.
   - **Weight Management**: Losing excess weight can help improve conditions like fatty liver disease.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can enhance liver function and overall health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver disease (like hepatitis or cirrhosis), specific medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms and promote liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help track liver function and detect any worsening of the condition.

4. **Nutritional Supplements**: Some may benefit from supplements like vitamin E or milk thistle, but it's important to consult a healthcare provider before starting any.

5. **Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures such as biliary drainage or liver transplant might be necessary.

6. **Avoiding Toxins**: Steering clear of environmental toxins, harmful substances, and certain medications can also support liver function.

Always consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan tailored to your specific situation.
