To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if there's a match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize funding tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before putting significant amounts into taxable accounts. These accounts have tax benefits that can compound over time.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now, focus on traditional accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA) to reduce your taxable income. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth accounts, which tax you now but allow tax-free withdrawals later.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks typically belong in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth, while bonds might be better in taxable accounts due to their taxable nature.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your accounts to ensure alignment with your financial goals. This helps maintain your desired risk level and takes advantage of market fluctuations.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Timing**: Plan for withdrawals based on tax implications. Typically, it's best to withdraw from taxable accounts first in early retirement to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

Itâ€™s often wise to consult a financial advisor tailored to your personal situation.
