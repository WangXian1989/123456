Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute Enough**: Make sure to contribute at least enough to maximize any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **Allocation Strategy**: Choose investments within the 401(k) that align with your risk tolerance and investment timeframe.

### 2. **Utilize IRAs for Tax Advantages**
   - **Tax-deferred Growth**: Contribute to a traditional IRA for tax deductions if eligible, or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Consider Income Limits**: Be aware of income limits for Roth IRAs and traditional IRAs, which might impact your contributions.

### 3. **Diversify Investments in Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquid Savings**: Use taxable accounts for more accessible investments and to cover short-term goals.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Focus on tax-efficient assets like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Tax Planning**: Distribute funds strategically based on your current and expected future tax brackets.
   - **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Gains**: Be mindful of holding periods to qualify for long-term capital gains rates in taxable accounts.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions among these accounts allows for tax-efficient growth and flexibility. Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or tax laws. Consulting with a financial advisor can further tailor strategies to your specific needs.
