These methods include establishing rapport through building trust and communication, using open-ended questions to encourage dialogue, and employing active listening techniques to better understand the suspect's perspective. Additionally, officials can utilize techniques such as cognitive interviewing, which focuses on facilitating the recall of memories rather than coercive tactics. It's important for law enforcement to comply with the Miranda rights, ensuring that suspects are made aware of their right to remain silent and their right to an attorney during interrogations.

Opening up the conversation with non-threatening, open-ended questions can lead to some real talk. They might even employ some slick psychological tricks, like cognitive interviewing, designed to jog the suspectâ€™s memory without pushing too hard.
