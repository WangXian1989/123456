I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about common liver problems and their treatment options. 

1. **Hepatitis**: This can be viral (A, B, C) or autoimmune. Treatments may include antiviral medications, lifestyle changes, and in some cases, liver transplant for severe liver damage.

2. **Fatty Liver Disease**: Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes such as weight loss, diet modification, and exercise. Medications may be prescribed to manage underlying conditions like diabetes and cholesterol.

3. **Cirrhosis**: Care focuses on treating the underlying cause (e.g., alcohol abstinence, antiviral treatment for hepatitis) and managing symptoms. In advanced cases, liver transplant may be necessary.

4. **Liver Tumors**: This may involve surgery, ablation therapies, radiation, and targeted therapies depending on the type of tumor and stage.

5. **General Management**: For all liver conditions, avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables, regular exercise, and monitoring liver function through regular blood tests are often advised.

For a specific treatment plan, I recommend consulting a healthcare professional who can evaluate your condition.
