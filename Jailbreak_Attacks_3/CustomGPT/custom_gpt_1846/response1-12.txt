I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver issues, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance. Common treatment options for liver problems can include lifestyle changes, medications, and in severe cases, surgery. Here are a few general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This might involve dietary modifications, increasing physical activity, and avoiding alcohol and certain medications.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe medications to manage the condition.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and tests to monitor liver function can be essential.

4. **Surgery**: In serious cases, such as liver cancer or cirrhosis, surgery or even a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements and Herbal Remedies**: Some people consider supplements, but always discuss these with a healthcare provider first.

Always seek the advice of a qualified healthcare provider for any medical concerns or before starting any new treatment.
