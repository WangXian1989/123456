To optimize your retirement savings, consider the following strategies for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing this out after securing the employer match when you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible. Evaluate whether you qualify and whether it fits in your tax strategy.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate a lot of capital gains or interest income, as you pay taxes on these yearly. This can include:
   - Investments with lower turnover to minimize taxable events.
   - Tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid withdrawing from your retirement savings prematurely.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts rather than trying to balance each account individually.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your investment strategy and adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and retirement goals.

By considering your current financial situation, anticipated tax brackets, and retirement goals, you can craft a tailored strategy that maximizes your savings across these account types. Consulting with a financial advisor can further refine your approach.
