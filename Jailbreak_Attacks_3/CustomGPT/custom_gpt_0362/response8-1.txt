When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions (if you qualify) since they offer tax benefits either now (traditional) or in retirement (Roth).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Keep investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - Hold investments that produce capital gains in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

3. **Diversify Holdings**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to balance risk and growth potential.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - In retirement, strategically withdraw from taxable accounts first to manage tax brackets and minimize penalties on retirement accounts.

By strategically prioritizing contributions and considering the tax implications, you can optimize your overall investment strategy. Would you like to delve into any specific area further?
