Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, age, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing this out if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable investment accounts. They offer more flexibility and access to funds without penalties, though they’re subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. 

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, withdrawals from taxable accounts are first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust according to market conditions, tax laws, and personal financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
