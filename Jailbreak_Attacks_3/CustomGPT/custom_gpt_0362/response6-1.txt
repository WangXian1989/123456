To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing the maximum to either a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income, such as stocks for long-term growth that benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.
   - Keep higher-yielding investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Stocks, bonds, and other assets should be proportionate to your risk tolerance and financial goals.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk profile and financial objectives, making adjustments as necessary.

By focusing on maximizing tax advantages while maintaining a balanced and diversified portfolio, you'll position yourself for better long-term growth and reduced tax liabilities.
