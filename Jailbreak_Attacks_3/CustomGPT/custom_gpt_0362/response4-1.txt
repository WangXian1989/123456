Balancing your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a few key steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Great for tax-deferred growth. Focus on this with higher contributions if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If not, consider a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxes, like long-term capital gains or qualified dividends.

3. **Investment Type**:
   - Place more aggressive investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - Consider more conservative investments (bonds) in taxable accounts, as they may be taxed at higher rates.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation reflects your risk tolerance and investment goals over time.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan the order of withdrawals for retirement to minimize taxes.
