To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Benefits from tax-deferred growth; contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k); consider this if you canâ€™t maximize your 401(k) or want to diversify your tax strategy.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing here for tax-free growth and withdrawals; ideal for younger investors expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or after you've maximized retirement accounts. They offer more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Horizon**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRAs for long-term investments, focusing on growth-oriented assets.
   - Allocate more stable, liquid investments in taxable accounts for easier access to funds if needed.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts with various asset classes tailored to your risk tolerance.

5. **Regular Review**: Adjust contributions and allocations annually based on performance and life changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
