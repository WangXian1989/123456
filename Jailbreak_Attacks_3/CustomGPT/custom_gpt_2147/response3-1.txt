The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often has higher contribution limits and potential employer matching. Advantages include tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Provide flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices but subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match firstâ€”this is essentially "free money."
   - **Max Out IRAs:** Consider fully funding your IRA (Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits.
   - **Additional 401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing contributions to your IRA, continue contributions to your 401(k) up to the limit.

3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Focus on tax-deferred or tax-free options for long-term growth in retirement accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with a lower tax burden or those you may need to access sooner.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering the overall investment strategy and risk tolerance.
   - Different accounts may hold different types of investments (e.g., higher-risk in tax-advantaged accounts, more stable investments in taxable accounts).

5. **Regular Review:**
   - Assess your financial goals regularly and adjust contributions as needed based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan that fits your specific situation.
