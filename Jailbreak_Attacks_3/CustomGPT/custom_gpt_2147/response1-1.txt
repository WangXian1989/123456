Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Debt Repayment**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before maximizing retirement accounts.

3. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

4. **Max out the 401(k)**: After your IRA contributions, go back to your 401(k) and aim to max it out if possible, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement. They provide more flexibility since you can withdraw without penalties.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and adjust as needed.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
