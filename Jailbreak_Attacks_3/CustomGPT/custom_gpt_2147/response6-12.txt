It's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues, as treatment depends on the specific condition. Here are some common treatment options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary Adjustments**: Adopt a balanced diet focusing on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while reducing saturated fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis, medications like interferons or direct-acting antivirals may be prescribed.
   - **Liver Support Supplements**: Some natural supplements may support liver function, though you should discuss these with your doctor.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - **Routine Blood Tests**: Monitor liver function and enzyme levels.
   - **Imaging Tests**: Ultrasounds or CT scans can assess liver health.

4. **In severe cases**:
   - **Surgery**: Like a liver transplant, if liver function is critically impaired.

Always seek personalized advice from a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
