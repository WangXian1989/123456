Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**  
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**  
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for more liquid investments as capital gains rates might be lower than ordinary income tax rates. This can be beneficial for short-term needs or specific goals.

### 3. **Diversification**  
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts that reflects your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**  
   - Monitor your accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and adjust as necessary.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan how and when to withdraw from each type of account in retirement for tax efficiency.
- **Investment Types:** Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, while using tax-inefficient options (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation can also be beneficial.
