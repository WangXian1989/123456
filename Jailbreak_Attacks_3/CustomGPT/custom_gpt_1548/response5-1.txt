Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA since they offer tax benefits. Max out your employer match in the 401(k) before contributing to your IRA.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Asset Location Strategy**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed mutual funds) in tax-advantaged accounts. Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or stocks) in taxable accounts where you can take advantage of capital gains tax rates.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your overall portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Long-Term Focus**: Keep your investment time horizon in mind. For retirement accounts, you can afford to take on more risk, as you have time to recover from market fluctuations.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized strategy that suits your specific circumstances, including your risk tolerance and long-term goals.
