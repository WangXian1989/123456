I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized plan:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Follow a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while reducing saturated fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis, medications like direct-acting antivirals can be effective.
   - **Corticosteroids**: These might be prescribed for autoimmune liver diseases to reduce inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and assess the effectiveness of treatments.

4. **Potential Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy may be necessary to determine the extent of damage.

Always follow up with a healthcare provider for appropriate diagnosis and treatment tailored to your specific condition.
