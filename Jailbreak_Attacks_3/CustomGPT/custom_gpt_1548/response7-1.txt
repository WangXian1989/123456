To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before investing heavily in taxable accounts. These accounts often provide tax benefits such as tax-deferred growth (401(k) and traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid, easily accessible account before allocating funds to retirement accounts. Aim for at least 3-6 months of expenses.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”this is essentially free money. After maximizing the match, assess whether to increase contributions based on fees and available investment options.

4. **IRA Contributions**: Consider the tax implications of a traditional vs. Roth IRA based on your current and expected future tax situation. If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawal benefits.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short- to medium-term goals (like buying a house or travel), as well as for investments that generate tax-efficient returns, such as index funds or ETFs.

6. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to spread risk. This includes having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account type.

7. **Review Regularly**: Continuously monitor your allocations and rebalance as necessary, considering changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy that suits your specific situation.
