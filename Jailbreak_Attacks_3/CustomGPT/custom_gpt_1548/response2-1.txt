Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors like your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). IRAs often have more diverse investment options than 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for money that you may need in the short term or for investments not suitable for tax-advantaged accounts (like certain investments that generate high taxes).

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, higher-risk investments (stocks) do better in tax-advantaged accounts due to potential capital gains, while more stable assets (bonds) may perform better in taxable accounts.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals. 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing in these accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide guidance based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced strategy that aligns with your personal financial situation.
