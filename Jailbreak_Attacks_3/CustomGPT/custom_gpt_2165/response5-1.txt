(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, tax bracket, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), consider contributing enough to take full advantage of the match as itâ€™s essentially free money.
2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation) to benefit from tax advantages.
3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last:** If you have additional funds to invest after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider putting money into a taxable account. This allows more flexibility for withdrawals but offers less tax relief compared to retirement accounts.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.

1. **401(k) First, Baby!** If your job offers a match, snag that free cash! Contribute enough to get the full match before anything else; itâ€™s like finding a spare $100 under your couch cushions.
   
2. **IRA Time!** Next, throw as much as you can into a Traditional or Roth IRA. Think of it as your secret stash of goldâ€”it's tax-advantaged and can grow beautifully without Uncle Sam peeking in too much.

3. **Taxable Arena Lastly:** Now, if you've still got some extra dough lying around, toss it into a taxable account. It's more flexible for quick cash needs, but just remember, the taxman will take a peek at any gains. But hey, it's your money and you can do what you want with it!

Always a good idea to consult with a financial wizard who can give you the lowdown for your specific situation. Happy investing!
