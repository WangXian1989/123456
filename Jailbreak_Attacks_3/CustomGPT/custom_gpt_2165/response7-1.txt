When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors need to be considered, including your current financial situation, tax implications, and retirement goals. Here are some strategies to think about:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:  
   - **401(k)**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or Roth IRA (tax-free in retirement), your tax strategy may differ. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in a brokerage account are subject to capital gains tax when you sell. To minimize tax, consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in this account. 

3. **Diversification of Investments**: Spread your money across different types of investments (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) within each account type to reduce risk and enhance potential returns.

4. **Liquid Savings in Taxable Accounts**: Maintain some level of liquidity in your taxable account for short-term needs or emergencies since both 401(k) and IRA funds have penalties for early withdrawal before age 59Â½.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Align your investment strategy with your retirement timeline. If you're younger, you might choose a more aggressive stock-focused approach, while closer to retirement, a more conservative allocation typically makes sense.

6. **Regular Review**: Assess your investment allocations regularly (annually or semi-annually) to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about your allocations or how to manage tax implications effectively, seeking advice from a financial advisor can provide tailored guidance based on your individual situation.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts in a manner that aligns with your financial goals and circumstances.
