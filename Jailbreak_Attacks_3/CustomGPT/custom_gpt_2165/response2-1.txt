Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially “free money.”
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and goals) before adding to taxable accounts.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are tax-deferred, which can reduce your taxable income. Keep in mind that withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, so consider this option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Evaluate Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - If you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement age, having money in taxable accounts can provide more flexibility without penalties.
   - Plan for Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) starting at age 72 for traditional accounts, which could affect your distribution strategy.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Keep a mix of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each type of account to maintain a balanced overall portfolio. This can also help manage tax implications when you start withdrawing.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure you stay aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider seeking professional advice tailored to your specific circumstances, especially if you have a complex financial situation.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a distribution plan that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
