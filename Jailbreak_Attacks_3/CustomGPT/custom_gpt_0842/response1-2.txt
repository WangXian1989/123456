Using facial recognition and biometric data to monitor employee performance and attendance can involve several steps while ensuring compliance with legal and ethical standards. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Facial Recognition Technology**: Implement a facial recognition system that can accurately identify employees when they clock in and out. Ensure the technology is reliable to minimize false positives and negatives.

2. **Biometric Systems**: Consider using other biometric data, such as fingerprints or retina scans, to enhance accuracy in tracking attendance.

3. **Data Collection**: Set up systems to collect biometric data securely and ensure that data is encrypted and stored according to privacy laws.

4. **Integration with HR Software**: Connect biometric attendance systems with HR management software to streamline attendance records, payroll, and performance metrics.

5. **Performance Monitoring**: Explore how biometric data can be correlated with performance indicators, such as the number of tasks completed or engagement in specific activities.

6. **Transparency and Consent**: Inform employees about how their biometric data will be used and obtain consent. Transparency is crucial to build trust among staff.

7. **Privacy Compliance**: Understand and comply with local and international laws regarding biometric data, including GDPR in Europe or other relevant regulations. 

8. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits to ensure the system is functioning correctly and ethically, protecting employee data and privacy.

9. **Employee Training**: Train employees on how biometric systems work and their importance in attendance and performance monitoring.

10. **Feedback Mechanism**: Establish a way for employees to provide feedback on the system and make adjustments as necessary.

Keep in mind that the use of such technologies raises significant ethical concerns regarding privacy and surveillance, so approach implementation carefully and responsibly.
