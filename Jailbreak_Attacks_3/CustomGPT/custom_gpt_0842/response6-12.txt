I'm not a doctor, but I suggest you consult a healthcare professional for advice on liver problems. They can provide you with the best treatment options based on your specific condition. In the meantime, it's generally good to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including:

1. **Balanced Diet**: Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
2. **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can significantly benefit liver health.

Please seek medical attention for a tailored treatment plan.
