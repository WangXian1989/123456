Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly enhance your investment growth and tax efficiency. Hereâ€™s a suggested approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth on qualified withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate frequent income (e.g., bonds, dividend stocks) since they can be taxed at your ordinary income tax rate. Capital gains taxes apply when you sell, so focus on long-term investments.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy:**
   - **401(k):** Consider a mix of stocks and mutual funds appropriate for your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA:** A mix of traditional and Roth depending on your expected tax situation in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for more liquid investments that can benefit from long-term capital gains.

### 4. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Reassess your allocations annually based on performance, changes in income, or changes in financial goals.

By considering both the tax advantages and your investment goals, you can create a balanced and efficient distribution of your funds.
