To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you are eligible, as they offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow.

2. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across your accounts. This can mean different asset allocations in each account type based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. For example, you might choose more aggressive investments in your long-term retirement accounts and more conservative investments in your taxable account.

3. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts are typically pre-tax, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal. They are great for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. Therefore, consider using tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize your tax burden.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy early. Since 401(k) and IRA distributions are taxable, consider the order in which you would withdraw from these accounts in retirement to manage your tax liability effectively.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation remains in line with your goals and risk tolerance.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances and goals.
