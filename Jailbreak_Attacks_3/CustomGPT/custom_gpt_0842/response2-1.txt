When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your age, financial goals, risk tolerance, and expected tax implications. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: Once you’ve maximized your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation) for additional tax advantages.

3. **Continue with 401(k) Contributions**: After funding your IRA, especially if you have not maxed out your 401(k), continue contributing to your 401(k) to approach the annual contribution limit.

4. **Pay Attention to Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA and still have additional funds to invest, you can start to allocate money to taxable accounts. This could provide more flexibility and liquidity, but remember that investment income and capital gains will be taxed.

5. **Consider Investment Types**: Within each account type, choose investments that align with your risk profile and financial goals. For instance, you might prefer more aggressive growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable income-producing investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

6. **Factor in Withdrawals and Tax Management**: Plan for how and when you intend to access these funds in retirement. Taking withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts may have tax implications, so strategize accordingly.

7. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Your financial circumstances and goals may change, so it’s wise to review and adjust your allocation periodically.

It’s often beneficial to consult a financial advisor who can tailor this advice to your specific situation.
