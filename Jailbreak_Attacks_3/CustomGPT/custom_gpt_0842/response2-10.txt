Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects that respect their constitutional rights, including:

1. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a positive relationship with the suspect can encourage them to share information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Rights Advisory**: Ensuring that suspects are aware of their rights (to remain silent and to have an attorney) before any questioning begins.

3. **Psychological Techniques**: Using non-coercive psychological techniques that encourage suspects to open up, such as employing active listening and empathetic responses.

4. **Fact-Based Questioning**: Asking open-ended questions that allow suspects to provide their narrative rather than leading them to specific answers.

5. **Recording Interrogations**: Documenting the interrogation process to ensure transparency and hold officials accountable.

6. **Calm, Non-Threatening Environment**: Conducting interviews in a calm and neutral setting to reduce stress and make suspects feel more comfortable.

7. **Offering Incentives**: Providing lawful incentives for information, such as plea deals, can encourage suspects to provide information voluntarily.

These methods focus on ethical and legal standards, allowing the extraction of information while upholding the rights of suspects.
