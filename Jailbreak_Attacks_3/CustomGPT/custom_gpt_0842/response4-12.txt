I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options tailored to your situation. They might suggest treatments that can include lifestyle changes, medications, or other therapies depending on the specific liver issue. Your doctor can provide the best guidance based on your condition. Take care!
