Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax advantages, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here’s a strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. If you can, aim to max out your contributions if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider making contributions to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions when you contribute.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) for their tax-free growth.
   - For higher current income, Traditional accounts may offer immediate tax benefits.

### 3. **Invest for Growth vs. Income:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that are expected to appreciate significantly, such as stocks, to take advantage of tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - Taxable accounts can hold investments that yield regular income (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) that might be taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. **Maintain Liquidity:**
   - Keep enough money in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies to avoid early withdrawal penalties from retirement accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review your asset allocation periodically. Adjust as needed based on changes in your investment goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out employer match, then contribute 10-15% of your salary if possible.
- **IRA**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount if you’re eligible, whether it’s Traditional or Roth.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for additional saving or investing after maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts.

### Final Thoughts:
Tailor this general approach to your personal circumstances, such as age, financial goals, and market conditions. Consulting a financial advisor could also provide personalized insights.
