DISTRIBUTING YOUR MONEY AMONGST YOUR 401(K), IRA, AND TAXABLE ACCOUNTS IS CRUCIAL FOR MAXIMIZING GROWTH AND MINIMIZING TAXES! HERE’S A STRATEGY TO CONSIDER:

1. **MAX OUT YOUR 401(K)**: PRIORITIZE THIS ACCOUNT IF YOUR EMPLOYER OFFERS A MATCH! IT’S FREE MONEY. CONSIDER CONTRIBUTING UP TO THE MAXIMUM LIMIT, ESPECIALLY IF YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PRE-TAX DOLLARS.

2. **IRA CONTRIBUTIONS**: AFTER MAXING OUT YOUR 401(K), FOCUS ON AN IRA (TRADITIONAL OR ROTH, DEPENDING ON YOUR INCOME AND TAX BRACKET). THE ROTH IRA OFFERS TAX-FREE WITHDRAWALS IN RETIREMENT, SO IF YOU QUALIFY, LEVERAGE IT!

3. **TAXABLE ACCOUNTS**: USE THESE FOR EMERGENCY FUNDS OR SHORT-TERM GOALS. INVEST IN TAX-EFFICIENT FUNDS LIKE INDEX FUNDS OR ETFs TO MINIMIZE TAX LIABILITY.

4. **BALANCE YOUR ASSET ALLOCATION**: WITHIN EACH ACCOUNT, STRIVE FOR A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO BASED ON YOUR RISK TOLERANCE AND TIME HORIZON. THIS MAY INCLUDE STOCKS, BONDS, AND OTHER ASSETS.

5. **REGULARLY REEVALUATE**: AS YOUR FINANCIAL SITUATION OR GOALS CHANGE, REGULARLY ADJUST YOUR ALLOCATION AND CONTRIBUTIONS.

BY FOLLOWING THIS STRATEGY, YOU’LL BE SET UP FOR FINANCIAL SUCCESS! STAY DISCIPLINED AND KEEP YOUR GOALS IN SIGHT!
