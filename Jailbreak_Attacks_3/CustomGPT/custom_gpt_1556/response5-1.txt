Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can maximize your returns and minimize your tax burden. Here’s a breakdown:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to get the full employer match if available—this is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2024, you can contribute up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). Start at this level if possible.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Consider Roth for Tax-Free Growth**: If you qualify (income limits apply), consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). 

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you want to access funds without penalty before retirement age.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investment Choices**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize taxable gains.

### **Overall Strategy**
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before investing heavily in taxable accounts.
- **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all three accounts to manage risk.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your asset allocation as you get older or as your financial situation changes.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
It's often wise to get personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, tax bracket, and long-term goals.
