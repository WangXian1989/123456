To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow more efficiently.

2. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match (that's free money!). Then, aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible.

3. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high dividends (like stocks) to minimize the tax burden. Consider tax-efficient funds or ETFs.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (like bonds or cash equivalents) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments in taxable accounts. Hold onto investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

This balanced approach helps optimize your investments for growth while minimizing your tax burden.
