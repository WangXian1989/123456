Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings. These accounts can grow tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth).
   - Consider holding investments that generate taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of employer matches if available.
   - Contribute to an IRA, especially if youâ€™re eligible for tax deductions (traditional) or want to benefit from tax-free growth (Roth).

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for a long-term, growth-oriented investment strategy.
   - In taxable accounts, consider more liquid or conservative investments, since you'll be subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you might withdraw funds in retirement. Different accounts may have different tax implications.

5. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly review and rebalance your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired risk profile.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Given the complexity of individual circumstances, speaking with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that works best for you.

Ultimately, your ideal distribution should align with your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.
