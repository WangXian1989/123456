I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on treatment options for liver issues. The best course of action depends on the specific liver condition you're facing (like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.). Here are some common treatment strategies:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit fatty, sugary, and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.
   - **Alcohol**: Avoid alcohol completely if you have liver disease.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition, there may be specific medications available. For example, antiviral drugs for hepatitis or medications to manage symptoms of cirrhosis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider can help monitor liver health and adjust treatment as needed.

4. **Liver Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, procedures such as endoscopy or liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Support Groups**:
   - Joining support groups can provide emotional and practical help.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan. They can provide advice based on your specific situation.
