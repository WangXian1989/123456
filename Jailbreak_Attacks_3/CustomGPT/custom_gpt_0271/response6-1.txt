To effectively allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Utilize tax-advantaged accounts first:
     - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income.
     - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Choose a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Balance your investments across accounts to avoid concentration:
     - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower turnover or that produce qualified dividends for more favorable tax treatment.
     - Reserve high-growth, higher-turnover assets for tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for future withdrawals: Consider the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type in retirement.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically reassess and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

By applying these strategies, you can optimize growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
