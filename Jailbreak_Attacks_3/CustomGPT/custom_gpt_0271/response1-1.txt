Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Focus on growth-oriented investments since contributions are made pre-tax.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be advantageous. If you believe you’ll be in a higher bracket, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Use the IRA for a mix of stocks, bonds, or other assets that align with your retirement goals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquid Investments**: Keep investments that you might need access to in the near term.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Tips:
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund separate from investment accounts.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust allocations based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
- **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
