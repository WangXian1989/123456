It's important to consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon when distributing your money. Here are some general steps you can follow:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Define your short-term and long-term financial goals.

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Great for long-term retirement savings, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages for retirement savings, but has contribution limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More flexibility for withdrawals but subject to taxes on gains.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) depending on your risk tolerance.

4. **Maximize Employer Match**: Consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

5. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out your IRA or 401(k) contributions before heavily investing in taxable accounts.

6. **Regularly Rebalance**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider getting personalized advice based on your specific situation.

This strategy can help you balance growth and risk effectively.
