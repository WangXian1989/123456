The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general guideline:

### Key Considerations

1. **Taxation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay capital gains tax on profits when you sell investments. Dividends and interest are taxed as income.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: The limit for employee contributions is higher than for IRAs. For 2023, it’s $22,500 (plus $7,500 if you’re over 50).
   - **IRA**: The contribution limit is $6,500 (plus $1,000 if over 50).

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Consider your short-term and long-term goals. Funds for short-term needs should be more liquid and conservatively invested.

4. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance to determine how aggressive or conservative your investments should be.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy

1. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your **401(k)** to get any employer match (this is essentially free money).
   - Next, max out your **IRA** contributions, especially if it’s a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals).

2. **Contribute to 401(k)**:
   - After maximizing the IRA, focus on maxing out your **401(k)** contributions.

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Additional Investments**:
   - Any additional funds should go into your **taxable investment account**. Here, you can invest in low-turnover index funds or tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains tax.

### Example Distribution Model

- **Retirement Age (30+ years away)**:
  - 401(k): 50%
  - IRA: 30%
  - Taxable Accounts: 20%

- **Pre-Retirement (10 years out)**:
  - 401(k): 40%
  - IRA: 30%
  - Taxable Accounts: 30%

- **Retirement or Nearing It (Less than 5 years)**:
  - 401(k): 30%
  - IRA: 30%
  - Taxable Accounts: 40%

### Continuous Review

- **Rebalance Your Portfolio**: Check your distribution and performance regularly (at least annually) and adjust based on life changes or market conditions.

### Consult with a Financial Advisor

- It's beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.
