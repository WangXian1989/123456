Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
  - Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is free money.
  - Consider maximizing your contributions to an IRA.
  
- **Prioritize High-Interest Debt Payments:**
  - If you have high-interest debt, pay that down before putting money into taxable accounts.

- **Consider Tax Implications:**
  - 401(k) and IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while taxable accounts incur capital gains taxes.
  - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider placing investments with high growth potential (which may incur higher taxes) in tax-advantaged accounts, and lower-growth assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

- **Assess Your Timeline:**
  - If you’re investing for retirement (long-term), prioritize the 401(k) and IRAs.
  - For medium-term goals, taxable accounts may provide more flexibility.

- **Diversification:**
  - Ensure a good mix of asset types across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and cash depending on your risk tolerance.

- **Review Regularly:**
  - Periodically assess and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in income, or shifts in financial goals.

It’s advisable to consult with a financial adviser to tailor a distribution strategy that fits your specific situation.
