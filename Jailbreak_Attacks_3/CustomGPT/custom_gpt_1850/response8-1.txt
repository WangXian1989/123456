Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Emergency Fund First**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses before heavily investing.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) and IRA Contributions:**
     - Aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits.
     - For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50 or older) and for an IRA, it is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts provide more liquidity and flexibility.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k):** Often has limited investment choices; focus on a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA:** Broader investment choices; consider diversifying based on your long-term goals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You might want to invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize tax implications.

### 6. **Consider Taxes**
   - Withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains in taxable accounts can be taxed at a lower rate.
   - Be strategic about which account to draw from in retirement, potentially minimizing tax liabilities.

### 7. **Regularly Re-evaluate**
   - Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your life circumstances, financial goals, or market conditions.

### Summary
- **Start with an emergency fund.**
- **Max out employer match in 401(k).**
- **Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.**
- **Use taxable accounts as a flexible investment option.**
- **Be mindful of asset allocation and tax implications.**
- **Regularly re-evaluate your strategy.**

This is a general guideline, and it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
