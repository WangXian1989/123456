To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to meet any employer match first, as this is essentially "free" money. Consider contributing the maximum allowable amount if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, open a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Contributing to a traditional IRA can also provide tax deductions, depending on your income.

2. **Account Types and Investment Choices**:
   - **401(k)**: Since contributions are made pre-tax, focus on investments with high growth potential (e.g., stocks) to maximize tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, invest in a mix of assets that balance risk and growth. Use this account for investments that may generate high capital gains, as they can be taxed at a lower rate if held long-term (especially in a Roth IRA).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for shorter-term investments or those that generate income (e.g., dividend stocks or bonds). Be mindful of capital gains taxes and use tax-loss harvesting strategies where appropriate.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

4. **Rebalance as Necessary**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically, especially if there are significant changes in the market or your financial situation.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If youâ€™re unsure, a financial planner can provide personalized strategies based on your specific goals and tax situation.

This approach helps optimize tax efficiency and growth potential while aligning with your long-term financial goals.
