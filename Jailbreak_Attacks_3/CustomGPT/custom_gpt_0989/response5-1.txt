To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you anticipate your tax rate will increase.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes, so it's usually best to keep investments with high growth potential or frequent trading here.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred. Reserve lower-risk investments (like bonds) for taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced investment portfolio across all three types of accounts, keeping in mind your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes. Typically, it's wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and lastly, tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

6. **Regular Contributions**: Make consistent contributions to all accounts, adjusting percentages based on your financial goals and market conditions.
