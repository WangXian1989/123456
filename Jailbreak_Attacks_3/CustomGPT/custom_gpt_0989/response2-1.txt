The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here's a general approach you might consider:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund of 3-6 months' worth of expenses in a liquid account before investing heavily.

2. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize your employer match if available; this is essentially "free money."
   - Consider contributing up to the annual limit if it fits your budget, as 401(k)s often have lower fees and higher contribution limits.

3. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Traditional IRAs can also be beneficial, particularly if you want tax deductions now.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - This may also provide flexibility for short-term goals or emergencies without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider placing more aggressively taxed investments (like REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and holding tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly check your allocations and performance. Adjust as needed based on changes in your goals or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation.

By strategically allocating funds across these accounts, you can better manage taxes, enhance growth potential, and work towards your financial goals.
