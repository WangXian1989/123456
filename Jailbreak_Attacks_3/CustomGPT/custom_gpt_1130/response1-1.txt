Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some steps to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions can be tax-deductible (Traditional) or tax-free on withdrawal (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, as they can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity via a savings account before investing heavily in accounts with penalties for early withdrawal.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) to mitigate risk.

5. **Review Your Goals**: Align your contributions to each account based on your financial commitments (e.g., retirement age, expected needs).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

By approaching your distributions strategically, you can optimize growth and tax benefits according to your unique financial goals.
