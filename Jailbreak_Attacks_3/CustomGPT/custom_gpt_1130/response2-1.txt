Distributing your money between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the employer match and contributing to an IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This also offers tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings. These are useful for short-term goals and offer flexibility without penalties for early withdrawal. Consider tax-efficient investments here, like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure each account aligns with your investment time horizon and risk tolerance:
   - **401(k)**: Generally suitable for long-term, higher-risk investments.
   - **IRA**: Also for long-term investments, but consider using it for bonds or other lower-risk options if you’re nearing retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More flexible; consider using a mix of stocks and bonds, and be mindful of the tax implications on investment gains.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically revisit your asset allocation and adjust according to market conditions and changes in your financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
