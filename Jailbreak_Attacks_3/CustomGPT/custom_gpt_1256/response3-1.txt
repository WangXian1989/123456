To provide the best advice on distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to consider a few factors such as your age, risk tolerance, income level, and retirement goals. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth IRAs**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA can be advantageous since you pay taxes now and withdraw tax-free later.
   - Conversely, if you need the tax deduction now, consider a traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds) since you’ll be taxed on gains and dividends in the year they are realized.
   - They can also provide liquidity for short-term goals.

4. **Balance Your Portfolio**:
   - Ensure your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts. This allows for a diversified portfolio.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

Always remember to consider your overall financial plan and goals when allocating funds across these accounts.
