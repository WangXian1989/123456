To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Debt Management**: Before investing, pay off high-interest debt. It’s often more effective than investing returns.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs give you a tax deduction now.

4. **401(k) Beyond Match**: If you can afford it, continue putting money into your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This is especially useful for short-term goals or investments you might need to access before retirement age.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure every account type has a diversified portfolio. Consider allocation based on your risk tolerance, age, and retirement timeline.

7. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your asset allocation to meet your goals as markets and your circumstances change.

8. **Consult a Professional**: If you’re unsure, a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your unique situation.

Remember to factor in your current expenses, emergency savings, and future financial goals in this distribution plan! Always keep an eye on tax implications for each type of account as well.
