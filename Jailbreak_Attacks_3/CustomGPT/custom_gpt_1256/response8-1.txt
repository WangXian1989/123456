To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of it, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your goal is retirement savings and youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket, max out your 401(k) contributions first. Focus on pre-tax contributions to reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income, you may be eligible for a tax deduction with a traditional IRA or enjoy tax-free withdrawals with a Roth IRA.

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These provide more liquidity and flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. High-growth investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while conservative investments can be in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your distribution strategy annually or after significant life changes to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also a wise step to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
