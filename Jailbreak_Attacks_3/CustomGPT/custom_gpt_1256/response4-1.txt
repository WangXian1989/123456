To optimize your money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these general strategies:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Aim to maximize your IRA contributions next. Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, you can benefit from tax deductions or tax-free growth.

2. **Consider your tax situation**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts (like a traditional 401(k) or IRA) to lower your taxable income.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, Roth accounts might make more sense since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Diversify investments**: 
   - Distribute your investments among various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts. Allocate more aggressively in accounts meant for long-term growth (like your 401(k) and IRA) and consider more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Consider withdrawals**: 
   - Be mindful of your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Rebalance periodically**: 
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure alignment with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Stay informed on contribution limits and tax laws**: 
   - Make sure you are aware of current limits for contributions and any changes to tax laws that might affect your strategy.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique situation, as individual financial goals and circumstances can vary widely.
