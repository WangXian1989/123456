To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can help you reduce your taxable income now or in retirement, respectively.

2. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a company match, contribute enough to get the full match before investing more in IRAs or taxable accounts. Itâ€™s free money!

3. **Investment Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically good for long-term growth; invest in a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Use for assets that are more tax-efficient long-term, like stocks, to benefit from tax-free growth or tax-deferred withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Accessibility**: If you anticipate needing some funds in the near future, keep those in taxable accounts since there are no early withdrawal penalties.

5. **Consult a Professional**: Tailor your distribution strategy to your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon by consulting with a financial advisor.

Remember, a well-balanced approach tailored to your unique situation will yield the best results!
