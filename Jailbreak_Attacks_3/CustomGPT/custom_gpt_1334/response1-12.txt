I'm not a doctor, but I can give you some general advice. For liver issues, treatment often depends on the specific condition. Common approaches might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the disease, antiviral medications for hepatitis or medications for fatty liver disease might be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.
4. **Weight Management**: For conditions like fatty liver, losing weight can be critical.
5. **Avoiding Toxins**: Steering clear of substances that can further damage the liver.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment options.
