To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Advantages**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from potential tax deductions and compound growth.
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

### 2. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Consider the types of investments suitable for each account. For example, plow higher-risk, high-growth investments into a Roth IRA, where growth will not be taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Bond Allocation**: Place more stable, income-generating assets, such as bonds, in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) to minimize tax implications on interest.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Gradual Withdrawals**: Plan how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.
   - **Tax Bracket Management**: Strategically withdraw funds from tax-advantaged accounts to manage tax brackets effectively.

### Key Considerations:
- **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account.
- **Long-Term Goals**: Align your contributions with your long-term financial goals and timelines.

By analyzing your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline, you can create a tailored distribution strategy.
