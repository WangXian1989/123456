Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a balanced approach that aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income and tax situation. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

### 2. **Invest According to Your Goals:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Generally, prioritize equity investments in your 401(k) and IRA due to tax advantages on growth. Consider a mix of domestic and international stocks.
   - **Fixed Income:** Incorporate bonds to balance risk if you're closer to retirement or want less volatility.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that may generate short-term capital gains or dividends, as these are taxed at your regular rate. Consider holding tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider the Tax Implications:**
   - **Withdrawal Strategies:** Understand how withdrawals from each account are taxed. For example, Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while 401(k) and Traditional IRAs tax withdrawals as ordinary income.
   - **Asset Location:** Place higher-yield, tax-inefficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Keep an Eye on Fees:**
   - Evaluate fees associated with your 401(k) and the expense ratios of mutual funds within your accounts. Lower fees can lead to better long-term returns.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Adjust your asset allocation over time to maintain your desired risk level, especially as you approach retirement.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **Age 30-40:** Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA with aggressive growth investments (70%-80% stocks, 20%-30% bonds).
- **Age 40-60:** Gradually shift to a more balanced approach (60%-70% stocks, 30%-40% bonds).
- **Age 60+:** Prioritize preservation of capital and income (40%-50% stocks, 50%-60% bonds).

### Conclusion:
Your specific situation will vary based on personal financial circumstances, so consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this guidance to your particular needs.
