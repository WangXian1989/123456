I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Improving diet, increasing physical activity, and avoiding alcohol can significantly help liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or the underlying cause.

3. **Weight Management**: For fatty liver disease, losing weight can reduce fat levels in the liver and improve overall health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track progress and identify any worsening of the condition.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases (like liver tumors or advanced cirrhosis), surgical options or even liver transplantation may be considered.

Always consult a healthcare professional for tailored advice and treatment options based on your specific condition.
