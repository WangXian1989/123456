To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching funds. These contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals, making it advantageous for those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs. Consider holding assets that generate qualified dividends to minimize capital gains taxes.

2. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you’re closer to retirement, prioritize accessing tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA for growth and tax benefits.
   - If you’re young, focus on maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA to benefit from long-term tax-free growth.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Allocate investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to balance risk and return.
   - Keep higher-risk investments (like growth stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate taxation.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes during retirement. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then traditional IRAs, and leave Roth IRAs for last to maximize tax-free growth.

5. **Annual Contributions**:
   - Aim to fully utilize annual contribution limits for each account type to optimize your investment growth and tax benefits.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment portfolio. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
