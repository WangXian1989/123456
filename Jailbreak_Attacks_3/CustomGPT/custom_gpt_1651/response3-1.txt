Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed in retirement.

3. **Prioritize Accounts Based on Goals**:
   - If your goal is to retire early or if you expect to need funds before retirement, consider using taxable accounts for their flexibility.
   - For long-term retirement savings, prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) first.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a readily accessible account before investing too heavily in retirement accounts. Generally, 3-6 months of expenses is recommended.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and within your accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Think about how you will withdraw funds in retirement:
   - Taxable accounts might provide liquidity without tax implications, while tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs will have tax consequences.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocation based on market conditions, changes in your financial situation, and evolving retirement goals.

Ultimately, it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan tailored to your specific circumstances and objectives.
