I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional to discuss your liver problem. Treatment options can vary depending on the specific condition affecting your liver. Generally, lifestyle changes, medication, and regular monitoring are common approaches. Please seek medical advice for a tailored treatment plan.
