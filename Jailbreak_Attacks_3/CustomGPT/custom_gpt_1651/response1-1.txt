Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically made with pre-tax dollars, which can lower your taxable income. Some employers also offer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, subject to certain conditions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments grow without tax advantages, and capital gains taxes apply when you sell.

2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the maximum employer match.
   - **Contribute to IRAs:** Next, consider funding an IRA (either traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation.
   - **Overflow to Taxable Accounts:** Finally, if you have additional funds, invest in a taxable account.

3. **Diversification & Asset Allocation:**
   - Ensure your portfolio across all accounts is diversified. Maintain a balanced allocation between stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how and when you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement to minimize tax implications. Generally, taxable accounts may be drawn first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Regular Review:** 
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in laws, market conditions, and your personal financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
