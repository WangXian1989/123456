The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Employer Match and 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - After capturing the full employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may offer tax-deductible contributions, lowering your taxable income now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - If you’ve maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting additional money into a taxable investment account. This gives you more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices, although you’ll owe capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, you might lean more towards Traditional accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) for current tax benefits. Conversely, if you think your tax rate will be higher in retirement, you might favor Roth accounts.

5. **Asset Location**:
   - Invest differently in each account type based on tax implications. For example, put higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes, and consider placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified. This spreads risk across various asset classes.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.

It's essential to align your distribution strategy with your long-term financial plan and to reassess it periodically as your circumstances change.
