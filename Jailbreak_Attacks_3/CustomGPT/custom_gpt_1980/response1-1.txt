To properly distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Ideal for higher earners.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   
3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings before investing heavily in retirement accounts. Generally, aim for 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Balance Contributions**:
   - Once you’re maximizing your 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (up to $6,500 per year, or $7,500 if you’re over 50 for 2023).
   - After that, contribute additional savings to your 401(k) and any remaining funds to taxable accounts.

6. **Tax Considerations for Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Favor investments that minimize taxes, like index funds or municipal bonds.

7. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your contributions and allocations based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, a professional can provide personalized strategies based on your situation.

Balancing these elements can help you grow your wealth effectively while preparing for retirement.
