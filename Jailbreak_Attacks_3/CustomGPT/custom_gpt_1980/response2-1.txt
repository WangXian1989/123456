Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for its tax-free growth and withdrawals. Aim for the annual contribution limit.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: Once you’ve maximized the match and contributed to your Roth IRA, consider increasing contributions to your 401(k) to the annual limit.

4. **Contribute to Traditional IRA**: If you have additional funds and your income allows, consider a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments once you maximize tax-advantaged options. This can include stocks, bonds, or ETFs.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes to balance risk and return.

7. **Reassessment**: Periodically review your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific situation.
