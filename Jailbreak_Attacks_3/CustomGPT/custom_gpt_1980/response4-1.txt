Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several considerations:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Limits on withdrawals.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account with tax advantages. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible access with no contribution limits, but subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA) to reduce your taxable income.
   - Taxable accounts can be useful for short-term goals since they offer flexibility.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - For 2023, 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if over 50) and IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50). Max out these accounts if possible.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (stocks) to minimize taxes over time.
   - Consider putting bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk. Adjust investment types based on the account's tax implications.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an accessible emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

7. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Align your distributions with your financial goals, considering when you plan to access each account.

8. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly assess your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

By balancing contributions effectively and considering tax implications, you can optimize your investment strategy across these account types. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
