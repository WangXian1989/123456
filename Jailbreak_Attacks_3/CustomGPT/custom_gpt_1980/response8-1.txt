Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Consider Pre-Tax vs. Roth Options**: Decide between pre-tax contributions (for tax deduction now) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals later).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be better.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and eligibility based on income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for investments you might need before retirement. 
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) and be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Diversify**: Ensure a balanced allocation across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Place tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, while tax-inefficient investments (like bonds and REITs) can go into tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - **Adjust as Needed**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, goals, and market conditions.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
