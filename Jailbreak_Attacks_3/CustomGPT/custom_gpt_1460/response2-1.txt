Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy to consider:

### Learning Objectives:
1. Understand the tax implications of each account type.
2. Explore investment growth potential across these accounts.
3. Learn how to balance contributions based on individual circumstances.

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Contributions:** Consider maximizing your employer's match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Treatment:** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Taxes are deferred until withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Investment Growth:** Often has a range of investment options. Growth is tax-deferred.

2. **IRAs (Traditional and Roth):**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal. Ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later on.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits and consider your eligibility based on income.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Allows for easier access to funds without penalties, but investment growth is subject to capital gains taxes.
   - **Diversification:** Can invest in a wide range of assets without restrictions imposed by retirement accounts.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions** (up to employer match).
2. **Contribute to an IRA** based on your tax situation (Traditional vs. Roth).
3. **Allocate Any Additional Funds** to taxable accounts for more flexibility and investment options.

### Follow-Up Questions:
**Q1:** What are your specific financial goals for retirement?  
**Q2:** Do you anticipate a significant change in your income when you retire?  
**Q3:** How would you prioritize liquidity versus tax advantages in your investment strategy?
