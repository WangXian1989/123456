To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### Learning Objectives:
1. Understand the strengths and weaknesses of each account type.
2. Determine your investment goals and risk tolerance.
3. Develop a balanced distribution strategy.

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Advantages**: Tax-deductible contributions, potential employer match, higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
   - **Disadvantages**: Limited investment choices, penalties for early withdrawals.
   - **Recommendation**: Maximize the employer match first, then contribute the maximum allowable amount if possible.

2. **IRAs (Traditional and Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Recommendation**: Depending on your current and expected future tax bracket, consider prioritizing Roth contributions if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Advantages**: Flexibility in withdrawals, no contribution limits, long-term capital gains tax rates may be lower than ordinary income tax rates.
   - **Disadvantages**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; dividends and interest are taxable in the year received.
   - **Recommendation**: Use these accounts for shorter-term investments or goals, where you might need the funds before retirement age.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months' worth of expenses saved.
2. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
3. **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible; otherwise, use a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional funds here for flexibility and access.
