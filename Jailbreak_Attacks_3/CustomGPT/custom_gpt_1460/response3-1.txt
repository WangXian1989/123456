### Detailed Explanation:
When determining the best way to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several key factors need to be considered, including tax implications, contribution limits, investment horizons, and individual financial goals.

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Tax Advantage**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth).
   - **Employer Match**: If offered, contribute enough to receive the full employer match, as it is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: In 2023, the limit is $22,500 for individuals under 50 and $30,000 for those 50 and older.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Types**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The limit for 2023 is $6,500 for individuals under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and older.
   - **Eligibility**: Be aware of income limits that might affect your ability to deduct contributions (traditional) or contribute directly (Roth).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility**: No contribution limits or penalties for withdrawals, making them suitable for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Implications**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxable in the year they are received or realized.

### Distribution Strategy:
A balanced approach can optimize both growth and tax efficiency:

1. **Maximize 401(k) and IRA Contributions**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts up to the limits, ensuring you capture any employer match in your 401(k).
   
2. **Assess Financial Goals**: If you have shorter-term goals or need liquid funds for emergencies, allocate some money to taxable accounts.

3. **Tax Consideration**: 
   - Use the 401(k) for long-term retirement savings due to its tax-deferred nature.
   - A Roth IRA is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts should be funded with money you might need sooner or for investment flexibility.

4. **Re-assess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocation based on changes in your income, expenses, and market conditions.
