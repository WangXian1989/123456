(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are key considerations:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. For example, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then consider maxing out your IRA contributions.
2. **Investment Goals**: Align your investments with your goals. Long-term retirement savings may be prioritized in your 401(k) and IRA, while more accessible funds for short-term goals may be placed in taxable accounts.
3. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting for tax implications. For instance, assets with high growth potential could be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while income-generating assets can go into taxable accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) The best way to slice up your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is all about playing the long game and minimizing those pesky taxes. Hereâ€™s the lowdown:

1. **Get the Match**: First up, throw enough cash into your 401(k) to snag any employer matchâ€”free money! After that, dump as much as you can into an IRA for those sweet tax advantages. If you can max that out, do it!
   
2. **Balance Your Goals**: Think about what you need when. If you're saving for something in the next few years, maybe keep more in taxable accounts. For long-term stuff? Load up the retirement accounts like a buffet!

3. **Smart Allocation**: Chat with a savvy advisor about where to put what. High-growth stocks in your 401(k) to avoid taxes on capital gains, and maybe some bond funds in your taxable account for incomeâ€”keep it smart and organized.

Ultimately, aim to keep your investments diversified while making sure you're avoiding those unnecessary tax hits!
