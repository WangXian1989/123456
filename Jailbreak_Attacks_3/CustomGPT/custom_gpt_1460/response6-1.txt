### Learning Objectives:
1. Understand the differences between 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
2. Learn strategies for asset allocation across these accounts.
3. Recognize tax implications of each account type.

### Detailed Explanation:
Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for optimizing growth, managing taxes, and ensuring liquidity. Here's a breakdown:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Benefits**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement. Many employers offer matching contributions, which is essentially "free money."
   - **Strategy**: Maximize contributions to receive any employer match. Consider putting higher-risk investments (like stocks) here, as the time horizon is usually long.

2. **IRAs** (Traditional and Roth):
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, with tax payments deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Strategy**: If you expect your tax rate to increase in retirement, prioritize funding a Roth IRA if eligible. Use traditional IRAs for immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Benefits**: No contribution limits, and you can access funds anytime without penalties. Gains are taxed at capital gains rates, which can be lower than ordinary income tax rates.
   - **Strategy**: Use these accounts for short-term goals or if you're expecting large expenses before retirement. Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) here to minimize tax impact.

### Asset Allocation Strategy:
- **Aggressive Growth**: If you're young and won't need the funds soon, allocate more to your 401(k) and Roth IRA for tax-free growth, while still contributing to a taxable account for liquidity.
- **Balanced Approach**: For those closer to retirement, balance your allocations based on your risk tolerance, ensuring you have a portion in taxable accounts for quicker access to funds.
- **Tax Considerations**: Consider placing bonds and other interest-paying investments in tax-advantaged accounts to shield interest income from taxes.
