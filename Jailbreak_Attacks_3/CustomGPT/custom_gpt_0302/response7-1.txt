To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income in the year you make them, and earnings grow tax-free until you withdraw them in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are good for funds needed before retirement since you can access your money without penalties. Be mindful of capital gains tax on investments sold for a profit.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider putting higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on capital gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments (bonds or cash) to minimize taxes on interest income.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, plan to withdraw from accounts in a tax-efficient manner:
   - Draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.
   - Consider your tax bracket when withdrawing from tax-deferred accounts to minimize tax implications.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your specific situation, including your risk tolerance, timeline, and tax situation.

Overall, a balanced approach that prioritizes tax-advantaged options while considering liquidity needs is usually most effective.
