Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - Maximize employer match: Contribute enough to get the full match if your employer offers one.
   - Consider contributing the maximum allowed annually to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - Traditional IRA can also be a good choice if you want tax-deductible contributions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out retirement accounts.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize taxes on gains.

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Keep higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have ample liquid savings outside these accounts for unexpected expenses.
