Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves careful consideration of your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key points to guide you:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k)**: Typically offer a limited selection of funds; diversify within these options based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Usually offers broader investment choices; consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or municipal bonds.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-term Goals**: Prioritize retirement accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for more liquid assets, allowing easier access to funds without penalties.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Tax Strategy**
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Hold high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and low-turnover investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 5. **Adjust as Necessary**
   - **Annual Review**: Reassess your strategy regularly based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal goals.

By effectively balancing contributions and investments across these accounts, you can optimize your overall financial strategy.
