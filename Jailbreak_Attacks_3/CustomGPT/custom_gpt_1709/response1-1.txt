Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer matchâ€”it's free money.

2. **Prioritize IRA Contributions**:
   - If you're eligible, consider maxing out a traditional IRA or Roth IRA for their tax advantages.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so allocate investments based on your expected holding period.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (stocks), and keep income-generating assets (bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Revisit your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A personalized strategy can help you optimize your investments based on your unique situation.

Balancing these factors will help you create a more effective distribution of your investments.
