(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some general principles:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**: 
   - **401(k)**: Traditional contributions lower your taxable income. Roth options provide tax-free growth.
   - **IRA**: Similar benefits as a 401(k). For tax deductions, a traditional IRA is beneficial if you meet income limits.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for flexibility and accessing funds before retirement without penalties, but they come with tax implications for capital gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice can also be very beneficial.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, hereâ€™s the lowdown on distributing your cash across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts like a pro!

1. **Max Out That Match**: First things first, if your job is throwing in free money with a 401(k) match, grab it! Contribute enough to snag the full matchâ€”it's like a no-brainer bonus.

2. **Know Your Tax Game**: 
   - 401(k): Put in pre-tax dollars if you want to lower that current income tax bill. If you're cool with tax-free growth later, go Roth!
   - IRA: Same deal hereâ€”traditional lowers your taxable income now, while Roth lets you avoid taxes in retirement. 

3. **Emergency Cushion**: Donâ€™t forget your emergency fund. Before diving deep into retirement accounts, stash away enough cash to cover at least 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: These are your flex zone. You can pull cash without penalties, but keep an eye on those capital gains taxes. They can sneak up on you!

5. **Diversify Like a Boss**: Spread your investments around to mitigate risks. Think about your age and how much risk you can handle while making your money work for you!

Always a good shout to get a financial advisor in your corner for tailored advice. Happy investing!
