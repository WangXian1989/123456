Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a breakdown of how to approach this:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Aim to fully fund a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on tax advantages and eligibility.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** These accounts provide tax advantages. Contributions may be tax-deductible (traditional), and Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell; consider holding low-turnover investments.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers limited investment choices; focus on diversified options like target-date funds or index funds.
   - **IRA:** You have a wider range of investment options. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and perhaps some alternative investments based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use this for short-term goals and liquid funds. Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize taxable income.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Spread investments across various asset classes to reduce risk. Consider your overall portfolio when allocating funds.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in goals, or shifts in the market.

### 6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - Younger investors might prioritize growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while those nearing retirement may shift towards stability.

### Final Thoughts
Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation and ensure you’re making the most of your tax-advantaged accounts.
