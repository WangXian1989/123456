To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Take full advantage of any employer match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes. Use them for investments that might appreciate over time or yield passive income.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term (taxable) vs. long-term (retirement accounts) goals. Longer-term investments can benefit from the tax advantages of retirement accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio in each account type. This can help manage risk and optimize returns.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when youâ€™ll access funds. Taxable accounts can provide more flexibility for short-term needs, while retirement accounts should be tapped wisely to avoid penalties.

5. **Annual Contribution Limits**:
   - Stay aware of contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA. Maxing out these accounts when possible can provide significant tax advantages.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
