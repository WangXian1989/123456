Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to help you allocate your funds effectively:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match first. This is essentially "free money" and a great return on investment.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) next, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The contribution limit for IRAs may be lower than a 401(k), but it can be a tax-efficient way to save for retirement.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**:
   - After maximizing your IRA contributions, go back to contributing more toward your 401(k). Aim to contribute up to the annual limit, as this account may have higher contribution limits than an IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Once you have maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility in terms of withdrawal and investment choices but do not provide the tax benefits that retirement accounts do.

5. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of your investments. For example, holding bonds or other interest-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts can reduce your tax burden, whereas stocks may perform better in taxable accounts due to favorable capital gains treatment.

6. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Regardless of the account type, ensure that your investments are well-diversified to manage risk. A mix of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or ETFs can help achieve this.

7. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Your age and when you plan to retire will impact how aggressively you should invest. Younger investors might opt for a larger proportion of stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement might favor bonds for stability.

8. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your investment strategy and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific circumstances and objectives.
