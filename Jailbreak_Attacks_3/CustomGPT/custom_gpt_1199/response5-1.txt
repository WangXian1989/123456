It's important to consider various factors when deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here's an overview of strategies you can consider for optimal asset allocation:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Consider allocating a significant portion of your savings here, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: With a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits. If you're eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for the tax benefits it offers, especially if you expect to be in a similar or higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - **Flexibility and Liquidity**: These accounts allow you to withdraw funds without penalties or restrictions, making them good for emergency funds or short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Favor investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs that have lower turnover, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Age-Based Allocation**: As a rule of thumb, your investment strategy should change as you age. Younger investors might allocate more to equities (which are typically held in tax-advantaged accounts), while older investors might shift towards bonds and income-producing assets as they approach retirement.
- **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Tax Considerations:
- Be strategic about which accounts to withdraw from in retirement. Drawing from taxable accounts first can allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.
- Analyze your current and expected future tax brackets to determine where to prioritize contributions.

It's often a good practice to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your personal financial situation, goals, and investment time horizon.
