The allocation of your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax situation. Here's a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to accounts that provide the best tax advantages. For instance, if your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **401(k) Contributions**: If you're not already doing so, consider contributing to your 401(k) to at least meet the employer match. This account allows for tax-deferred growth, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on your contributions or earnings until you withdraw them.

3. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) if eligible. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Evaluate which type of IRA suits your tax situation best.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've taken full advantage of your retirement accounts, you can invest additional funds in taxable accounts. Taxable accounts provide more flexibility with withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes on any profits from investments sold. Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize tax exposure.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy within each account to reduce risk. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets well suited to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your investment allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

7. **Consult Financial Advisors**: Speak with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation. They can help you create a well-structured plan based on your goals and needs.

Always keep in mind the implications of taxes when withdrawing from these accounts, especially if you're nearer to retirement age. Balancing tax-deferred growth with liquidity and flexibility in taxable accounts can lead to a well-rounded financial strategy.
