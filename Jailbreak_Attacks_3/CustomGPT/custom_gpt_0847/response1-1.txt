The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and current tax situation. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next (if eligible), as they provide tax advantages, especially for retirement savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged contributions, any additional savings can be directed to taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize traditional accounts (401(k) and IRA) now. If you think you’ll be in a lower bracket, Roth accounts might be better.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, ensure you have a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Reassess Periodically**: Reevaluate your distribution and investments yearly or after significant life changes to keep your strategy aligned with your goals.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
