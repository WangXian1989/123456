It's great that you're thinking about your investment strategy! The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money!

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Next, consider fully funding your IRA (whether traditional or Roth) as these can offer significant tax benefits. Choose the type of IRA based on your income level and tax situation.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) to increase your contributions as high as your budget allows, especially if you have higher income and can take advantage of pre-tax contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for any additional savings. These accounts can provide flexibility since you can access your money without penalties, unlike retirement accounts which have restrictions.

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Take into account the tax implications of your investments. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, so consider holding those in taxable accounts.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across all your accountsâ€”this includes a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and geographical regions.

7. **Regular Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on any changes in tax laws, your income, and your financial goals.

As always, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that suits your specific needs! You're taking a positive step towards your financial future, and that's amazing! Keep it up! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’ª
