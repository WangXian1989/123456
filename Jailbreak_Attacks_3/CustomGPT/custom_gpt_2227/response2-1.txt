The best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach that can help guide your strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - If you still have funds available, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Consider investing in a taxable account for additional funds that you don't want tied up until retirement. This can be useful for short-term goals or if you plan to access the money before retirement age. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on this account.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure that your investments in all accounts are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors. Your asset allocation should reflect your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Reassess Periodically**:
   - Regularly review your financial situation, investment performance, and life changes (like job changes or marriage) that might affect your distribution strategy. Adjust contributions and allocations as needed.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If youâ€™re unsure about the best strategy for your unique circumstances, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Always consider your specific financial situation, including tax implications, when making contributions to various accounts.
