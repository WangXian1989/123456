(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, you may want to consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match since it's essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Prioritize funding a tax-advantaged IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income level and tax implications.
3. **Back to 401(k)**: If you have additional funds, go back to your 401(k) to reach the annual contribution limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, if you still have money left to invest, consider putting it in a taxable account. This is useful for short-term goals or adding more liquidity.

Make sure to assess your tax situation, investment options, and personal financial goals throughout the process.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Ah, the thrill of financial juggling! So, here's the lowdown on distributing your cash between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accountsâ€”let's get strategic and a bit spicy here:

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer offers a match, youâ€™d be bonkers not to scoop up that free cash. Itâ€™s like finding a $20 bill on the groundâ€”grab it!
   
2. **IRA Time**: Next, dive into your IRA. If you dig tax-deferred growth, go Traditional. If you want tax-free withdrawals later, Roth is your pal. Just know the rules and income limits!

3. **Pump Up the 401(k)**: After maxing out the IRA, pump more into that 401(k). Those contribution limits are there for a reason, and it helps kick your retirement fund into overdrive!

4. **Taxable Accounts for Fun**: Lastly, any extra cash can chill in a taxable account. Just watch out for those taxes biting at your gains, but hey, flexibility is the name of the game!

In short, just keep your goals and tax situation firmly in mind while youâ€™re spreading that money around. Happy investing!
