The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as that is essentially free money.
   - Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) up to the match limit before allocating funds to other accounts.
   - Consider the investment options available in your 401(k), which may include higher-cost funds.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This is especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.
   - Maximize your IRA contributions after taking full advantage of your 401(k) match.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the short-term, as IRAs and 401(k)s have penalties for early withdrawal.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs in taxable accounts, such as index funds with low turnover to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider your overall tax strategy when selecting investments for your taxable account, as you may want to balance short-term and long-term investment strategies.

4. **Overall Balance**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Regularly review and rebalance your allocations as needed, considering changes in income, market conditions, and life events.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a specific strategy that fits your unique circumstances.
