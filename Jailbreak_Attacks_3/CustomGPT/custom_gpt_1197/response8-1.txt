Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general overview to help guide your decisions:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - **Use Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit; it's free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits ($22,500 in 2023, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your expected tax situation in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 in 2023 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals but come with tax implications on dividends and capital gains. 
   - **Investment Choices**: Use these for investments that may generate lower capital gains or for funds that you might need access to before retirement.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to capture the full employer match.
- **Max IRA Contributions Next**: Once you’re contributing enough to get the match, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions, prioritizing a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
- **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRAs, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the limit if you have additional funds to invest.
- **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any additional funds can be placed in taxable accounts for more immediate access without penalties, but be mindful of the tax implications.

### Considerations:
- **Tax Efficiency**: Placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like bonds in IRA/401(k) and stocks in taxable) can enhance tax efficiency.
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement, considering which account’s tax implications will affect you at that time.
  
### Consult a Financial Advisor:
Given the complexity of these decisions, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
