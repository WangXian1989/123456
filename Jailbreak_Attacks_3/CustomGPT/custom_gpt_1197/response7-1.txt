Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match since this is essentially free money. 
   - Max out your 401(k) contributions if possible, as they provide tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Consider funding a Roth IRA if you're eligible and believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement. Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - If you expect a lower tax rate in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be more advantageous since you can deduct contributions from your taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you'll need access to before retirement or for goals with a shorter time horizon.
   - Consider placing investments with favorable tax treatment (like qualified dividends and long-term capital gains) in taxable accounts.

### General Allocation Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Always maintain an emergency fund in a liquid account before investing aggressively.
- **Debt Management**: Pay off high-interest debt before focusing heavily on investments.
- **Diversification**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Suggested Steps:
- **Establish an Overall Financial Plan**: Determine your retirement needs and investment goals.
- **Prioritize Accounts Based on Benefits**: Max out the 401(k) match, then fund IRAs based on tax strategy, and allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to customize your investment strategy based on your specific circumstances.
