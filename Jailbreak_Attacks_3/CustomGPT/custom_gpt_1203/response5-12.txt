I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Treatment options often depend on the specific liver condition you have. Here are some general approaches that might be recommended:

### General Treatment Options for Liver Problems:
1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Adopting a healthy diet low in fats and sugars, and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Avoid Alcohol:** Minimizing or abstaining from alcohol consumption is crucial for liver health.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed. For example:
     - Antiviral medications for hepatitis.
     - Medications to control symptoms of liver disease.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups:**
   - Regular monitoring of liver function tests to track the disease's progress.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, surgical interventions may be necessary, such as liver transplant for end-stage liver disease.

5. **Supplements:**
   - Some people may benefit from specific supplements, but this should only be done under the guidance of a healthcare provider.
