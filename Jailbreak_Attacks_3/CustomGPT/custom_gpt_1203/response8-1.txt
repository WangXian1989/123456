It's great that you're thinking about how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Diversifying your investments is crucial for achieving long-term financial goals. Here’s a general guide on how to effectively allocate your money across these accounts:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** A tax-advantaged retirement savings plan sponsored by an employer. Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Also a tax-advantaged account, with both Traditional (tax-deductible contributions) and Roth (tax-free withdrawals) options.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment accounts where you will pay taxes on gains and dividends as they are realized.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to meet your employer's match if available. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribute to IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. 
   - **Max 401(k) Contributions:** After employer match and IRA contributions, try to max out your 401(k) contributions (up to $22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Fill Taxable Accounts Last:** Use taxable accounts for investment after exhausting tax-advantaged options.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Strategy:**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts:** Focus on investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds, ETFs, or tax-managed funds).
   - **Growth vs. Income Investments:** 
     - In tax-advantaged accounts, you may want to hold high-growth investments (like stocks) since gains aren’t taxed until withdrawal.
     - Consider holding income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 4. **Adjust for Time Horizon:**
   - **Near Retirement:** Shift more towards conservative investments in retirement accounts to preserve capital.
   - **Long-Term Growth:** If young or many years from retirement, focus on growth-oriented investments for higher risk tolerance.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your target risk level and investment goals.

### Example Distribution Approach:
| Account Type | Priority | Suggested Contribution Strategy |
|--------------|----------|-------------------------------|
| 401(k)       | High     | Max out to employer match, then max contribution |
| IRA          | Medium   | Max out limits if eligible (Traditional/Roth) |
| Taxable      | Low      | Fund after utilizing tax-advantaged accounts |

### Conclusion:
- Your situation may vary based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax status. It can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your individual circumstances.
