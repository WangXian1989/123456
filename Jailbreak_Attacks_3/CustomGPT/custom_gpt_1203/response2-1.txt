Distributing your money among different types of accounts, such as a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here‚Äôs a general guideline to help you strategize your asset allocation:

### 1. Understand Account Types

- **401(k)**
  - **Tax-Advantaged:** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Taxes are paid on withdrawals in retirement.
  - **Employer Match:** Make sure to contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
  - **Traditional IRA:** Same tax benefits as a 401(k) but can be funded independently.
  - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

- **Taxable Accounts**
  - **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts have no contribution limits or penalties for early withdrawal.
  - **Tax Implications:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized.

### 2. Recommended Strategies for Distribution

#### Prioritize Contributions: 
1. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. **Fund an IRA**: Depending on your tax situation, consider maxing out a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs, in particular, are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your retirement accounts, use leftover funds for a taxable brokerage account for additional investments.

#### Maintain Asset Allocation:
- **Diversification**: Diversify your investments to manage risk. Allocate across different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and real estate.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired level of risk based on your age, goals, and market conditions.
  
### 3. Tax Considerations:
- **Tax-Efficient Investments**: In taxable accounts, consider holding tax-efficient investments like ETFs or index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.
- **Interest Income**: Avoid holding high-interest investments in taxable accounts to reduce tax exposure.

### 4. Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance:
- **Short-term Goals**: Keep funds needed in the next few years in more liquid and safer investments (e.g., bonds or cash equivalents).
- **Long-term Goals**: Focus on growth through equities for retirement savings, particularly in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Example Strategy:
| Account Type  | Contribution Priority | Suggested Investments                         |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **401(k)**    | 1st                  | Target-date funds, diversified mutual funds   |
| **IRA**       | 2nd                  | Index funds, ETFs, or individual stocks       |
| **Taxable**   | 3rd                  | Tax-efficient funds, diversified assets |

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the best way to distribute your money depends on your individual circumstances and financial goals. Consider discussing your strategy with a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice based on your situation. üè¶üí∞
