I'm not a doctor, but it's really important to consult with a healthcare professional for liver problems. They can provide you with the best treatment options based on your specific condition. Generally, treatment options for liver issues may include:

- **Medications:** Depending on the cause, medications can help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
- **Lifestyle Changes:** Diet, exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

Please seek medical advice for the most accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.
