To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing taxable income now. This is ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA:** Choose between Traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free withdrawals). A Roth IRA is beneficial if you anticipate higher future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest for short-term goals or as a supplement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

### 2. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k):** Focus on a diversified portfolio with a mix of stocks and bonds, considering your retirement timeline.
   - **IRA:** Use tax-advantaged space for higher-growth investments, like equities, since withdrawals in retirement can be tax-efficient.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Prioritize investments with favorable tax treatments, like index funds or municipal bonds.

### 3. **Contribution Limits and Matching:**
   - Maximize your contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match to fully leverage "free" money.
   - Contribute to your IRA up to the limit based on income and eligibility.
   - Any additional funds can go into your taxable account for flexibility.

### Example Allocation Approach:
- **Aggressive Growth (if younger):**
  - 401(k): 50% (Max match and catch-up contributions as retirement nears)
  - IRA: 30% (Focus on growth, potentially Roth)
  - Taxable: 20% (Liquidity for short-term uses)

- **Conservative Approach (if nearing retirement):**
  - 401(k): 40% (Shift to conservative investments)
  - IRA: 40% (Split between traditional and Roth as needed)
  - Taxable: 20% (Maintain cash or short-term assets)

### Conclusion
Tailor your distribution based on personal goals, risk tolerance, and future tax implications for a balanced approach to wealth accumulation. Regularly review and adjust contributions as necessary to stay aligned with your financial objectives.
