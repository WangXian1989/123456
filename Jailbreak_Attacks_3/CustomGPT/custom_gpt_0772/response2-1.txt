Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now. Ideal for high-income years.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, a Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions but are taxed at withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Good for flexibility and liquidity. You'll pay capital gains taxes on earnings, but you can withdraw anytime without penalties.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term retirement goals, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term needs, focus on taxable accounts for easier access.

4. **Diversity and Asset Allocation**: 
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Regular Review and Adjustments**: Your distribution and contributions should evolve with any changes in income, expenses, or life goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: They can provide tailored advice based on your unique situation and goals.

Overall, a balanced approach while considering tax implications and personal financial goals will guide your distribution strategy effectively.
