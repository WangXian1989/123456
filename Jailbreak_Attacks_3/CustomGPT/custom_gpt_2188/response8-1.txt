Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:**
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA Contributions:**
     - If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Consider Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Asset Allocation:**
   - Place investments with the highest growth potential (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, municipal bonds).

### 3. **Prioritize Taxation Levels:**
   - Be mindful of short-term vs. long-term capital gains; aim to hold assets long enough in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term rates.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk profile.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - As you approach retirement, plan withdrawals to minimize tax impact (e.g., withdrawing from taxable accounts first).

### 6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have liquidity for emergencies in a savings account rather than tying up all your cash in investments.

### Conclusion:
The optimal distribution varies based on individual circumstances, so consulting with a financial advisor may be beneficial for personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
