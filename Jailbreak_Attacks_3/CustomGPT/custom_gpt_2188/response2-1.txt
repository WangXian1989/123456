Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially "free" money.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Once you’re maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you qualify, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Tax Bracket:** If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) can reduce your taxable income. If you're in a lower bracket, a Roth may be beneficial.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy:** Consider how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement; balancing taxable and tax-deferred accounts can help optimize your tax situation later.

### 3. **Consider Investment Options:**
   - **401(k):** Review available investment options and fees. Choose low-cost index funds if available.
   - **IRA and Taxable Accounts:** These typically offer more flexibility in investment choices, allowing for potentially higher returns depending on your risk tolerance.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Reevaluate your allocation periodically (at least annually) and adjust based on performance, changes in your financial situation, or changes in your goals.

### 6. **Emergency Savings:**
   - Before heavy investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) to avoid dipping into retirement accounts.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** 10-15% of your salary (up to the match)
- **IRA:** Max out contribution limits if possible (currently $6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in excess of the above based on additional income or investment strategy.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this advice to your specific situation.
