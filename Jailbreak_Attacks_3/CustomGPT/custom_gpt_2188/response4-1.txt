Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts optimally depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment options. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are taxed as capital gains, which can be more favorable than ordinary income tax rates.

3. **Prioritize Accounts**:
   - Start with the 401(k) up to the match.
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - After maxing out retirement accounts, invest surplus funds in taxable accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - More conservative investments (like bonds) can be placed in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications on income.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice can help you navigate specific circumstances and optimize your strategy.

This strategy helps balance immediate tax benefits and long-term growth potential across accounts.
