Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s an overview of strategies for each account type:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Contribution Limits:** Take full advantage of employer matching contributions; it’s basically free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **Investment Choices:** Generally limited to the options provided by your employer. Focus on low-cost index funds if available.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Considerations:** Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, whereas Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits ($6,500 as of 2023, with a catch-up option for those over 50).
   - **Investment Flexibility:** IRAs often offer a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Tax Implications:** Gains are taxed as capital gains, so you'll want to consider investments with favorable tax treatment (like index funds or municipal bonds).
   - **Liquidity:** Taxable accounts provide flexibility for accessing funds without penalties before retirement age.

### **General Strategy:**
- **Maximize Contributions:** Consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then fund your IRA, starting with a Roth (if you qualify) for its tax-free growth benefits.
- **Diversify Investments:** Balance your portfolio according to your risk tolerance, ensuring you have a mix across all account types.
- **Monitor and Adjust:** Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on your changing financial goals and market conditions.

### **Considerations:**
- **Time Horizon:** Younger investors may prefer a more aggressive allocation, while those approaching retirement might prioritize capital preservation.
- **Tax Bracket:** Consider your current and expected future tax rates, as this can influence whether you should prefer pre-tax (401(k), Traditional IRA) or post-tax (Roth IRA) contributions.
