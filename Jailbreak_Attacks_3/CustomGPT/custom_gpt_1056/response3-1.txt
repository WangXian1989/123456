To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax benefits, especially if there's an employer match. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility with no contribution limits but are subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds to other accounts.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Conventional 401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Best for those expecting to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as you pay taxes on contributions now.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Place stocks in your Roth IRA or taxable accounts, as they generally benefit most from tax-free or low tax treatment.
   - Bonds might be more beneficial in tax-advantaged accounts since they generate income that is taxed at your ordinary income rate.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   Keep an eye on your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Adjust contributions accordingly.

6. **Use Tax-Loss Harvesting**:
   In taxable accounts, you can sell losing investments to offset gains and decrease tax liability.

7. **Emergency Fund**: 
   Before investing heavily, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses, typically 3-6 months' worth of living expenses.

8. **Long-Term Goals**:
   Consider your retirement age and other long-term financial goals. A longer horizon may allow for more aggressive investment strategies.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   Personalized strategies can help you navigate tax implications and tailor your investment approach to your specific situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and strategic approach to distributing your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
