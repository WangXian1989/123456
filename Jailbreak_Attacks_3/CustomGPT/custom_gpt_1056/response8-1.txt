Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Retirement Contributions**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and traditional IRA): Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. Aim to place higher-growth investments here, as taxes will be deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for assets you might need before retirement or investments that generate taxable income (like dividends or interest). Consider placing lower-growth investments or tax-efficient funds here.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified across asset classes. This can mitigate risk and provide potential for better returns.

4. **Age and Time Horizon**:
   - Younger investors may lean more heavily into stocks for growth in their 401(k) and IRA, while older investors might favor bonds, especially in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you'll withdraw funds. Typically, draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA) to minimize your tax burden in retirement.

6. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - Review your allocations periodically (at least annually) to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor tailored to your personal situation can provide valuable insights and strategies.
