Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach to maximize tax efficiency and growth potential. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Consider tax implications**: Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income now, while Roth 401(k) involves after-tax contributions for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Investment choices**: Review the funds available; often, 401(k) plans have limited options.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals; a Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions now, but taxes will be due later.
   - **Contribution limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and income eligibility for Roth IRAs.
   - **Investment flexibility**: IRAs typically offer more investment options than a 401(k).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest for liquidity**: Use taxable accounts for short-term savings or goals. They offer flexibility to withdraw without penalties.
   - **Tax considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes and tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxable events.
   - **Asset location**: Consider high-growth or higher-dividend-paying investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### **Distribution Strategy**
- **Prioritize high-interest debts**: Pay off any high-interest debts first.
- **Emergency fund**: Maintain 3-6 months of expenses in easily accessible cash.
- **Max out tax-advantaged accounts**: Focus on maxing out 401(k) contributions and IRA contributions before adding to taxable accounts.
- **Rotate investments**: As financial situations change, adjust the balance according to risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial planner, particularly to navigate tax implications based on your income level and goals.

By carefully managing the distribution of your investments across these accounts, you can optimize growth while minimizing taxes.
