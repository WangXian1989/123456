When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider maxing this out if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Strategy depends on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: This is where you can access funds without penalties, but this comes with potential capital gains taxes on earnings.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a separate, accessible account to avoid penalizing your retirement accounts early.

4. **Diversification**: Within each account type, ensure you're diversifying investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**: As you approach retirement, think about your withdrawal strategy to minimize taxes, potentially drawing from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide tailored advice based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Consider these strategies based on your financial goals and timeline.
