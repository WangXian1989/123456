Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable investment accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement age, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. It’s effectively free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions:** After receiving the employer match, consider how much more you can afford to contribute. The 401(k) offers tax-deferred growth, so if you are in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement, it might be beneficial.

3. **IRA Contributions:** If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA can provide upfront tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Evaluate which is more advantageous based on your current and expected future tax situation.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out your retirement accounts, you can contribute to taxable accounts. These are useful for flexibility and can be a good place for investments that generate less tax, like index funds or municipal bonds, due to more favorable tax treatments.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and sectors to mitigate risks.

6. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your investment portfolio and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you're uncertain, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

This strategy is quite general, so the best approach for you may vary based on individual circumstances.

Make sure to consider the potential tax implications and retirement withdrawal strategies as you plan your distribution.
