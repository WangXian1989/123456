When considering how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to focus on your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here’s a general approach you could take:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to this account to take full advantage of the match as it’s essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions up to the IRS limit if financially feasible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA could give you a tax deduction for contributions.

2. **Consider Liquidity and Taxability**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to a taxable account. This will provide you with liquidity and flexibility without the penalties associated with withdrawing from retirement accounts early.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments within each account according to your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and market conditions. 
   - Higher growth-oriented investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.

4. **Continuous Evaluation**:
   - Regularly assess and adjust your contributions based on annual income changes, financial goals, and market performance.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific needs.
