When it comes to distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several strategies to consider, each dependent on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to help you make informed decisions:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - After capturing the employer match, consider maxing out your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.
   - For 2023, the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re 50 or older). This account can grow tax-free (Roth) or tax-deferred (traditional), making it a valuable option.

### 3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k):**
   - Once you’ve made contributions to your IRA, return to your 401(k) and contribute up to the annual limit ($22,500 for those under age 50 and $30,000 for those 50 or older for 2023).
   - Consider the tax implications of the contributions, as traditional 401(k) contributions can reduce your taxable income for the year.

### 4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for greater flexibility. These funds can be accessed without penalties and can be valuable for short- to medium-term goals.
   - In taxable accounts, consider using tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs that minimize capital gains distributions.

### 5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   - Regardless of the account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This may involve a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.
   - Allocate more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts, where they can grow tax-free until withdrawal, and hold more conservative investments in taxable accounts where taxes on gains may apply.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Regularly review your portfolio allocations and individual account performance to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions. Adjust contributions or reallocations as needed.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you’re unsure about the best strategies for your unique situation, consider consulting a financial advisor. They can help create a personalized plan based on your overall financial picture.

By following this strategy, you can optimize your savings across different account types while considering taxes, growth potential, and access to funds. Always ensure your approach aligns with your long-term financial goals.
