Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA if eligible, as it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Balance Between Accounts:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Suitable for long-term growth since your contributions are tax-deductible.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold more liquid and short-term investments here, as they can provide flexibility and should be chosen with tax implications in mind (e.g., favoring long-term capital gains).

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Determine your risk tolerance and invest accordingly; consider higher-risk investments in tax-deferred accounts to benefit from long-term growth without immediate tax burdens.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly assess and adjust your portfolio across all accounts to align with your financial goals.

### Summary:
- **Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.**
- **Maintain a diversified asset allocation across all accounts.**
- **Evaluate your financial goals regularly to adjust your strategy.**

This strategy allows you to maximize growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities, ultimately leading to a more secure financial future.
