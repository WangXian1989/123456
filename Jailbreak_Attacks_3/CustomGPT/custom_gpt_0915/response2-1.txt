Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can be advantageous for investments with lower capital gains rates or tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs). Use them for funds you may need to access before retirement.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep your asset allocation in line with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline across all accounts. This may affect how much risk you take in each account.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Think about your retirement goals and when you plan to start withdrawing. Different accounts have different tax implications upon withdrawal.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Maintain your desired asset allocation by periodically rebalancing your portfolios across all accounts.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal factors such as age, retirement goals, and risk tolerance greatly influence the optimal distribution strategy. A financial advisor can offer tailored advice.

A general guideline might look like this:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed based on your eligibility.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any additional savings to these accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

Adjust your strategy as your circumstances change, and stay informed about tax laws and investment options.
