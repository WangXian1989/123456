I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatments that are usually explored for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This can include weight loss, a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue, medications might include antiviral drugs for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases, or diuretics for fluid retention.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function can be crucial.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be considered.

5. **Supportive Therapies**: These can include therapies to manage symptoms, such as pain management or nutritional support.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
