To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Max out any employer match: Ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of your employer's match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth: 401(k) accounts grow tax-deferred, so prioritize higher contributions here, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Choose between Traditional and Roth IRA: Depending on your income and tax situation, either could be beneficial. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Max out annual contributions if possible: For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older). 

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for short-term goals: If you have savings goals that are less than five years away, consider putting money in taxable accounts since they offer more liquidity.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds: Look for index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes, and consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Overall Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts: Maintain a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Rebalance regularly: Ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your goals, adjusting contributions if necessary based on market performance.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts: Offset taxes on gains by selling underperforming assets.
   - Be mindful of withdrawal strategies in retirement to minimize tax liabilities: Consider which accounts to draw from first based on your tax situation in retirement.

It's beneficial to periodically review your allocation and make adjustments based on life changes, market conditions, and any changes in your financial goals.
