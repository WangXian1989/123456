Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and whether you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth) or tax-deferred growth (Traditional). 

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: If you're comfortable with your IRA contributions and still have funds available, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions. This can offer higher contribution limits compared to an IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts provide more liquidity and flexibility. If you anticipate needing access to your funds before retirement or want to invest in assets not available in tax-advantaged accounts, allocate some funds here. 

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of investment types in each account. For example, tax-efficient investments (like index funds) are better suited for taxable accounts, while tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) might be better placed in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Balance Risk and Time Horizon**: Assess your risk tolerance and how soon you need the funds. Longer-term investments can afford to be riskier (like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA), while shorter-term goals might require a more conservative approach in taxable accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Your financial situation may change, so it’s important to review your distribution strategy annually and adjust based on your goals, market conditions, and any changes in tax laws.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
