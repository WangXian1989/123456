Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some tips to consider:

1. **Take Advantage of Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before directing funds elsewhere.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider funding your retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) to the maximum allowed before investing in taxable accounts. This can offer better tax efficiency.

3. **Prioritize Roth Accounts**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k). Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you have a longer time until retirement, you might consider being more aggressive in tax-advantaged accounts, while using taxable accounts for more liquid investments.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that you have a diverse allocation within each account type (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

6. **Be Aware of Withdrawal Rules**: Understand the rules for withdrawals and penalties for each account type, which can affect your overall strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best allocation for your situation, consider seeking advice from a financial professional for personalized guidance.

It's important to regularly review and adjust your investment strategy based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.
