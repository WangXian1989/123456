Deciding how to allocate your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general tips to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits as 401(k)s, but Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts don't have the same tax advantages but offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment options.

3. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**: 
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term retirement savings.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergency funds due to their liquidity.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy within each account type to balance risk and return.

5. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your allocations and rebalance as necessary to align with changing goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
