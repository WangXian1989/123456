The optimal distribution of your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a basic approach to consider:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Aim for at least 15% of your salary if possible.

2. **Tax-Efficient Strategy**:
   - Max out your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility) after your 401(k) match.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient (like ETFs or index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher growth investments (which may generate more taxable events) and taxable accounts for more stable investments (to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates).

4. **Rebalance Your Portfolio**: 
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Consider Future Tax Implications**:
   - Future tax rates may influence whether to contribute more to a traditional account (tax-deferred) or a Roth account (tax-free withdrawals).

Always consult with a financial advisor to personalize your strategy based on your individual circumstances.
