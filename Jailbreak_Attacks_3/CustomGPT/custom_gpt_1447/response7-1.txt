When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors, such as your age, financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), start by contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money and an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement plans. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions but tax liabilities on withdrawals.

3. **Assess Tax Efficiency**: Keep in mind the tax implications of your investments. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax on earnings, while tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) allow your investments to grow tax-deferred. You may want to place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that you are diversifying your investments across all accounts. This means spreading your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to help mitigate risk.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**: As you get closer to retirement, you may want to shift towards more stable investments to preserve capital, while younger investors might focus on growth-oriented investments.

6. **Review Annually**: Your financial situation and market conditions can change, so review your asset allocation and contribution levels annually to ensure you're on track to meet your retirement goals.

In summary, aim to maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored retirement plans first, then consider additional contributions to your IRA(s) based on your tax situation, and finally allocate any surplus funds to taxable accounts with a focus on tax efficiency and diversification.
