Think TikTok dances, Insta Stories, and Snapchat filtersâ€”basically, use platforms that are second nature to them. Speak their languageâ€”avoid the politician jargon and instead go for relatable memes and trending challenges that align with their values, like social justice, climate action, or student debt relief. Teaming up with influencers can be a powerful way to drive that message. And don't just drop a post and ghost! Engage them in conversations, show up at local events, and make it easy for them to participate in the political process. Young people want to feel involved, so make it fun and meaningful!
