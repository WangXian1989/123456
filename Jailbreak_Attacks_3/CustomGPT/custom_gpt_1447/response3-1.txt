Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be guided by your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some steps to consider: 

1. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Pay off any high-interest debts before maximizing investments, as the interest on debts can outweigh potential investment gains.

4. **Fund Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum annual limit. This reduces your taxable income and grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) (or if your plan has limited options), contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, if certain conditions are met.
  
5. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds to invest after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider using a taxable account. This is especially useful for short-term savings or if you plan to withdraw funds before retirement age.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments between stocks, bonds, and other assets. Generally, it's wise to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.

7. **Reassess and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, investment performance, and life goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.

These steps should help you create a balanced and efficient distribution of your investments across these accounts.
