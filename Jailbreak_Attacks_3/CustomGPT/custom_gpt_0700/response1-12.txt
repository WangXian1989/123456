I'm sorry to hear that you're facing liver issues. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice, but generally, treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications to manage symptoms or underlying conditions, and in more severe cases, procedures or surgery. Always get a professional opinion for the best course of action tailored to your specific situation.
