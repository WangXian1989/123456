The best way to distribute your money across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. If your employer offers a Roth option, consider how this fits your tax strategy.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Decide based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility. This is particularly useful for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement age without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: The tax treatment of your investments can greatly impact your overall return. For example, holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts can help minimize the tax burden.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and any changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If youâ€™re unsure, speaking with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that considers your unique financial situation and long-term goals. 

This strategic approach will help you build wealth efficiently while optimizing tax advantages.
