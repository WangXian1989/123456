The best way to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider for optimal distribution:

1. **Maximize Contributions:** 
   - Always aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you qualify for tax-deductible contributions or the benefits of a Roth IRA.

2. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA:** If you have a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible. Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings from dividends, interest, and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Allocate more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) for potential higher growth, where tax implications are delayed.
   - Consider holding more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxable income.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for how you intend to withdraw funds in retirement. A common strategy is to first withdraw from taxable accounts, allowing your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - Consider your expected tax bracket during retirement to strategize withdrawals from 401(k) and IRA accounts effectively.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changing financial goals to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance.

Always consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and ensure you are making informed decisions based on the latest tax laws and investment opportunities.
