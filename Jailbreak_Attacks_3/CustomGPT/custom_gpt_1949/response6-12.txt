I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that for liver problems, you should consider seeing a healthcare professional for personalized advice. General approaches often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and reduce liver fat.

2. **Medical Treatments**:
   - **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may be prescribed to treat infections, reduce inflammation, or manage symptoms.
   - **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and adjust treatment as necessary.

3. **Avoiding Toxins**:
   - Limit alcohol consumption and avoid drugs that can harm the liver.

4. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some may explore herbal supplements, but it's critical to consult a doctor before trying these.

It's essential to seek professional advice for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your condition.
