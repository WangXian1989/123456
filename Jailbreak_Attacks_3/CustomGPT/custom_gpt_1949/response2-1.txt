Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a strategic approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k)):**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match if one is offered. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions:**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Assess Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of contribution limits. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to your 401(k) (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older), and up to $6,500 to an IRA (or $7,500 if 50 or older).

4. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Allocate funds to your taxable account once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts. Taxable accounts provide flexibility and access to your money without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of living expenses) in a liquid form before heavily investing in these accounts.

6. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments within these accounts. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to reduce risk while aiming for growth.

7. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on performance, changes in income, life events, and shifts in your goals. Adjust contributions as needed.

8. **Long-term Focus:**
   - Adopt a long-term investment strategy to ride out market fluctuations and potentially benefit from compounding returns over time.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money, ensuring you take advantage of retirement planning benefits while maintaining liquidity for your financial needs. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific situation.
