Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a simplified strategy to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute the Max**: If possible, max out your contributions to take full advantage of tax-deferred growth. The limits for 2023 are $22,500 for those under 50, and $30,000 for those 50 and older.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Consider Your Tax Situation**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial. If you think your tax rate will be higher, a Roth IRA could save you money in the long run.
   - **Max Contributions**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older). Aim to contribute the max if your budget allows.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments where you need flexibility. This can include an emergency fund, or money for short-term goals.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider investing in index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Balance and Diversify**:
   - Assess your investment portfolio regularly to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Diversification across these accounts can help manage risk.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your complete financial picture.

Always remember to revisit your strategy as your circumstances change!
