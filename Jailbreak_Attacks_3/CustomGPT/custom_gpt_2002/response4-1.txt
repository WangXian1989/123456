To provide a detailed response, I would need a bit more information. Please clarify the following:

1. **What is your age and retirement timeline?**
2. **What are your financial goals?**
3. **What is your current tax bracket?**
4. **Are there specific investment preferences you have?**
5. **What is your risk tolerance (e.g., conservative, moderate, aggressive)?**

Once I have these details, I can help you with a more tailored strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
