The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit first. This is essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit allowed for the year, especially if there's a matching contribution.
   - **IRA**: Once youâ€™ve maximized your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) & IRA**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year of contribution, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize contributions to a Roth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is beneficial for flexibility and accessibility. Preference should be given to investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or stocks held long-term.

5. **Review Investment Allocation**: Diversify your investment choices across all accounts. Keep in mind your risk tolerance and investment objectives. Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts and consider more tax-inefficient investments, like bonds, in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation as needed based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: For a personalized strategy considering your unique situation, it may be beneficial to seek advice from a financial planner or tax advisor.

Ensuring that you blend contributions across these accounts strategically can maximize your investment potential and minimize your tax liability over time.
