To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**: 
   - **401(k)**: Typically employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax, and the account grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Comes in two main types—Traditional and Roth. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are regular investment accounts where you pay taxes on capital gains and dividends, but they offer more flexibility and fewer restrictions on withdrawals.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to your IRA. For the 2023 tax year, individuals can contribute up to $6,500 to an IRA (or $7,500 if you’re age 50 or older). Decide between Traditional and Roth based on your tax situation.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Investments held in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax and taxes on dividends. Consider holding investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and those with favorable tax treatment (like stocks with long-term growth potential) in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments according to your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. A common strategy is to hold a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts, adjusting allocations in tax-advantaged accounts based on your tax strategy.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Consistently contributing to your accounts can take advantage of dollar-cost averaging and help build your retirement fund over time.

7. **Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your portfolio to ensure that it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Rebalance your accounts as necessary, considering the tax implications of selling assets in taxable accounts.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategies for your specific situation, consider consulting a certified financial planner or tax advisor to tailor your strategy based on your financial goals, income level, and tax situation.

By applying these principles, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, optimizing your tax situation while preparing for retirement.
