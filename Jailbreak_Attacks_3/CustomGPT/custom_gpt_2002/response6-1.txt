To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Max out employer-sponsored 401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider making contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The choice between the two will depend on your current tax situation and future expectations.

2. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Focus contributions on tax-deferred options (401(k) and Traditional IRA) during higher-income years to lower taxable income.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Utilize taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax impacts, such as municipal bonds or long-term capital gains.

3. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Ensure that your asset allocation corresponds with your risk tolerance and time frame for investments.
   - **Different Strategies by Account Type:** Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) that can benefit from compounding, while keeping more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Implement a Diversified Portfolio:**
   - **Investment Choices:** Ensure asset allocation aligns with overall financial goals, and diversify investments within each account type for risk management.

5. **Review and Rebalance:**
   - **Regular Assessments:** Periodically review your asset allocation and ensure it remains aligned with changing financial objectives, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
