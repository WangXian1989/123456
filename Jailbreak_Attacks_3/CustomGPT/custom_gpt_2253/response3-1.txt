When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to account for factors such as tax implications, employer contributions, investment goals, and your overall financial situation. Here's a general guideline to help you with this decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Funding Your IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to your IRA (Individual Retirement Account). Depending on your income level, you might be able to contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, both of which have tax advantages.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (reducing your taxable income), and taxes are paid upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRA contributions may also be tax-deductible, whereas Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so keep this in mind for your investment strategy.

4. **Diversification of Investments**: Ensure that your investment choices across all accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Different accounts might be suited for different types of investments based on their tax treatment.

5. **Reassessment and Balancing**: Regularly review your allocations and contributions to ensure they align with your retirement goals and adjust as necessary based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

6. **Long-term Strategy**: Focus on long-term growth rather than short-term gains. Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, as they usually yield better long-term results.

In summary, a common approach is to maximize the employer match in your 401(k), contribute to an IRA for tax advantages, and then consider any additional investments in taxable accounts as needed. Adjust your strategy based on your personal financial goals and consult with a financial advisor if needed for tailored advice.
