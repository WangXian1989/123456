The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions can lower your taxable income now, allowing your investments to grow tax-deferred until retirement. Prioritize these for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility for withdrawals and may be beneficial for short-term goals. Consider this as a place to hold less tax-efficient investments.

3. **Diversification of Assets**:
   - Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash in each account type based on your risk tolerance. For example, you might seek higher risk (and potentially higher growth) investments in your 401(k) and IRA while keeping more conservative investments in taxable accounts for liquidity.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s (and an additional catch-up contribution if you're over 50), and $6,500 for IRAs.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - Plan for potential early withdrawal penalties, especially for IRAs, and structure your contributions accordingly based on when you might need access to funds.

By employing a balanced approach that takes into account your tax situation, contribution limits, and investment goals, you can effectively distribute your money to maximize growth and manage taxes.
