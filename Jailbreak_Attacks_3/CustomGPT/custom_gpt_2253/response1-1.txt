When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors to optimize your investment strategy:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offered through employers, these plans often include employer matching contributions, which can boost your retirement savings. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages, with traditional IRAs allowing pre-tax contributions (taxed upon withdrawal) and Roth IRAs providing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current versus expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer greater flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, allowing access to funds before retirement age.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match before investing in other accounts.
   - **Consider an IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out an IRA for its tax advantages. If you're under 50, the contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500; for those 50 and older, itâ€™s $7,500.
   - **Fund Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for any additional investment funds once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Evaluate your current and expected future tax rates. Contributing to a Roth IRA might be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall investment strategy is well-diversified across different asset classes, regardless of the account type.

5. **Consider Age and Time Horizon**:
   - As you get closer to retirement, you may want to adjust your asset allocation to reduce risk.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It's beneficial to seek personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

In summary, prioritize your contributions to maximize employer matches, consider tax implications, and regularly assess your investment strategy.
