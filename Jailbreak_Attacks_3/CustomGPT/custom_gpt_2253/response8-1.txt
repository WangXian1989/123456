To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: This employer-sponsored account allows for pre-tax contributions, which can lower your taxable income. Focus on maximizing employer match if available.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Evaluate your current tax situation to choose between these options.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts offer flexibility with investments, but you’ll pay taxes on any dividends, capital gains, and interest income in the year they are realized.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you can benefit from a tax deduction or tax-free withdrawals.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investing that may not fit into the limits of your retirement accounts.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Utilize these for investments that are expected to generate high returns over the long term, such as stocks, since the growth is tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds and ETFs, that generate lower taxable distributions. Consider holding bonds or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income.

4. **Rebalance Accordingly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your investment allocations to maintain your desired risk tolerance. Ensure that each account is working toward your overall investment strategy and financial goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about the best approach for your specific financial situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications.

By utilizing these strategies, you can create a well-rounded approach to funding your retirement and growing your wealth effectively.
