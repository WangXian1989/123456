It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment for liver problems, as options may vary depending on the specific condition. Common approaches can include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications to manage symptoms or underlying causes, and in severe cases, surgical interventions or liver transplantation. Regular monitoring and follow-up care are also essential.
