When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), start by contributing enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Generally, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs). These accounts grow tax-deferred or tax-free, offering significant long-term benefits.

   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize any employer matching. This is tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on your contributions or earnings until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider funding an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) contributions. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50).

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts come with immediate tax implications since you’ll need to pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains. They provide liquidity and flexibility, but consider using these accounts for funds that you may need in the short term or for investments that favor long-term capital gains.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, diversify your investments to manage risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Regularly Reassess**: Periodically review your investments and contributions to ensure they align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and any life changes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can help you create a personalized strategy that considers your financial situation and goals.

Each individual’s financial situation is unique, so it’s crucial to consider your own goals, income needs, and risk tolerance when making these decisions.
