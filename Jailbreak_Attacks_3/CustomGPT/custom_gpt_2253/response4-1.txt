Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations to help you decide the best way to allocate your funds:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), it’s generally a good idea to contribute enough to receive the full match before putting money into an IRA or taxable accounts. This is effectively “free money” that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income for the year. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, this can be advantageous. Consider maxing out your contributions to take full advantage of tax benefits.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, similar to 401(k) plans. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Decide which type aligns best with your current and projected financial situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals and investment options but come with tax implications on capital gains and dividends. They can be used for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Your investment choices in each account should reflect your risk tolerance and when you plan to access the money. Typically, funds meant for retirement (like those in 401(k) or IRA) may be invested more aggressively, while money in taxable accounts can be allocated based on shorter-term goals.

4. **Tax Diversification**: Spreading your investments across different account types can help manage your tax liability in retirement. It allows you to strategically withdraw funds based on your tax situation at that time.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax laws and investment strategies, it can be beneficial to seek personalized advice from a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy that fits your unique financial situation.

Before making any drastic changes to your financial distribution, a thorough review of your overall financial plan is essential.
