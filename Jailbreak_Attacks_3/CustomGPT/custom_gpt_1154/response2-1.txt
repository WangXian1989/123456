When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After taking full advantage of any employer matching, consider contributing to your IRA (traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free growth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: Understand any tax implications of withdrawals from your 401(k) and IRAs. Traditional accounts are taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts are tax-free if certain conditions are met.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs can all play a role in a well-rounded portfolio.

5. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and have extra funds to invest, consider a taxable account. This can provide more flexibility, as you can withdraw without penalties, although you'll need to pay capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on changes in your financial goals, market conditions, and any life events.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to get personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.

Each individual's financial situation is unique, so it's vital to consider your specific circumstances when making decisions about your investment distribution.
