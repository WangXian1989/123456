I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for liver problems, as treatment options depend on the specific condition. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, surgery. Regular check-ups and monitoring your liver health are also important. Always seek professional advice for medical concerns.
