The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, time horizon, and current investment options. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for the 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. The tax benefits of these accounts can compound your savings over time. Depending on your income level, you may prefer a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Think about the tax implications of your investments. Withdrawals from traditional retirement accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified distributions from a Roth account are tax-free. Taxable accounts can incur capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments. 

4. **Asset Allocation**: Your investment strategy should consider risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, higher-risk investments (like stocks) might be placed in tax-deferred accounts to maximize growth and minimize tax impact.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type. This can help mitigate risk and improve long-term returns.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: As markets fluctuate, your asset allocation may drift from its target. Periodically review and rebalance your investments within and among your accounts to maintain your desired allocation.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy in Retirement**: As you approach retirement, develop a strategy for how you will withdraw assets from your accounts. This might involve withdrawing first from taxable accounts, then from tax-deferred accounts, and finally from tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax laws and investment strategies, it can be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to create a tailored plan that meets your specific needs and objectives.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your unique financial situation and retirement goals.
