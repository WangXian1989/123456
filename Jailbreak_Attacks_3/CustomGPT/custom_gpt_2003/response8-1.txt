When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's vital to assess your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize your contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. Contributing up to the match is often considered free money and provides tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Traditional IRA may provide tax-deduction benefits, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. The choice between these depends on your current vs. expected future tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, consider taxable brokerage accounts. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but do not offer the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and investment objectives. Stocks typically offer higher potential returns but come with higher risks, while bonds provide more stability.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, as they generate less taxable income. Conversely, consider putting higher-yield investments (such as bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy that aligns with your overall financial plan and goals.
