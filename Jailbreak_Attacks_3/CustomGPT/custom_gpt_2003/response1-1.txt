To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Treatment**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, potentially reducing your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but taxes are owed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax upon sale, but you pay taxes on dividends and interest as they accrue.

2. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributions there to take full advantage of the match as it is essentially free money.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) (plus $7,500 for those over 50), $6,500 for an IRA or Roth IRA (plus $1,000 for those over 50).

4. **Investment Growth Potential**: Consider your investment choices and growth potential in each account. Generally, more aggressive investments might be suitable for tax-deferred accounts where taxes are delayed.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for accessing funds without penalties compared to retirement accounts, which have specific withdrawal rules.

6. **Retirement Timeline**: If you are closer to retirement, you may want to favor more conservative investments, particularly in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk and improve returns.

A possible strategy could be:
- Max out your 401(k) contributions up to the employer match.
- Contribute to an IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
- Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you have maxed out tax-advantaged options.

It's often best to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
