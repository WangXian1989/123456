I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet low in fats and sugars can help.
   - **Alcohol Abstinence**: Avoiding alcohol can prevent further liver damage.
   - **Weight Management**: Maintaining a healthy weight may improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: 
   - **Antivirals**: For hepatitis or viral infections.
   - **Corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests and imaging to monitor liver health.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: 
   - Some may benefit from vitamins like E or D, but consult a physician first.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
