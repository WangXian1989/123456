To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize contributions to an IRA for compound growth tax-free or tax-deferred.

2. **Balance After Tax Benefits**:
   - Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of assets across all accounts. Consider risk tolerance and time horizon for each investment.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax implications on withdrawals. Typically, withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and adjust contributions as needed based on performance and market conditions.

Tailoring this approach to your financial goals and tax situation will optimize your investment strategy.
