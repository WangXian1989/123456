Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Here are some effective strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**  
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored; often has tax benefits. Look for employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account; traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments subject to capital gains tax; suitable for more flexible, shorter-term goals.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals**  
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds needed in the next few years.
   - **Retirement Savings**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, focusing on long-term growth.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**  
   - Split investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Consider higher risk in tax-advantaged accounts due to long-term nature.

### 4. **Prioritize Contributions**  
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match in your 401(k) first.
   - After that, fund your IRA, especially if it offers tax advantages.
   - Finally, allocate the remaining funds to your taxable accounts.

### 5. **Keep an Eye on Fees**  
   - Be mindful of the fees in your 401(k) plan. If they are high, consider placing more money in a lower-cost IRA or taxable account.

### 6. **Tax Considerations**  
   - Place high-growth investments (that will have large capital gains) in tax-advantaged accounts (IRA, 401(k)).
   - Hold investments that generate income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.

### 7. **Review and Adjust**  
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Conclusion  
Balancing contributions across these accounts can enhance tax efficiency and growth potential. Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
