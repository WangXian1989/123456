Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts efficiently depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." If you're under 50, for 2023, the limit is $22,500; if over 50, it's $30,000.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth). For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Traditional Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions reduce taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Prioritize a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may throw off significant short-term gains or income (like bonds) that you want to minimize immediate tax impact on. These can also serve as flexibility for needs outside retirement.

### 4. **Asset Location Strategy:**
   - Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to allow growth without immediate taxation.
   - Put income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your allocations yearly to maintain your target asset mix based on your goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice based on your specific goals, income, and tax situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

### Example Distribution:
- **Max Out 401(k) to get the match**
- **Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible**
- **Allocate remaining savings to taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.**

This balanced approach helps minimize taxes and maximize growth potential for retirement.
