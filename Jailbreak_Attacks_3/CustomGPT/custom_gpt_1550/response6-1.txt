Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider the traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth if you qualify based on income limits.
   - Use Roth accounts (if available) for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Position**:
   - Taxable accounts are more suitable for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds).
   - Place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize compound growth while deferring taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts, but tailor the asset allocation based on the tax treatment of each account.
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like ETFs or tax-managed funds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider your withdrawal strategy to minimize taxes by choosing which account to withdraw funds from first based on your tax bracket and need.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor their advice to your specific financial situation and goals.
