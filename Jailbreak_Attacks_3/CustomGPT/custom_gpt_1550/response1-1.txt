To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**: 
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions, tax-deferred growth, and potential employer matching. Best for maximizing employer benefits.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, which can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax contributions with tax-free growth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments that aren't tax-advantaged, where you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Max Out Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Put investments expected to grow significantly in tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or Roth IRA to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate lower tax liabilities or for investments you'll want to access before retirement.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund established outside of these accounts before heavily investing.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes in all accounts to reduce risk.

6. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type and aim to maximize these where possible.

7. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investment style and risk tolerance with your long-term financial goals. 

8. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

9. **Consult a Professional**: If unsure, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation. 

This balance can help maximize growth while considering your tax situation and investment goals.
