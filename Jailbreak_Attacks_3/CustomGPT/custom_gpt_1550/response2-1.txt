Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) because these accounts offer tax advantages that can help your money grow more efficiently.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: The taxation of your investment income varies by account type:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as regular income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may also be tax-deductible, with future withdrawals taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they are realized, which can influence your investment strategies.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set up before heavily investing. This should cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Think about your investment time horizon and risk tolerance. Typically, longer-term investments can afford to take more risks, while shorter ones might lean towards more conservative strategies.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess your portfolio to ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy based on your specific situation and objectives.
