Managing your investment across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Here's a general strategy you might consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize maximizing this benefit. You should aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. Beyond that, consider the investment options available to you in the 401(k), and allocate a portion of your contributions here based on your risk tolerance and target retirement date.

2. **IRA Accounts**: If youâ€™re eligible for a Roth IRA, it may be beneficial to contribute here as well. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. For traditional IRAs, contributions may be tax-deductible, which can be advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for short-term goals and can offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals. You can invest in assets that may be more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **Risk Tolerance**: Assess how much risk you are willing to take. Generally, higher-risk investments can be beneficial in retirement accounts due to their long-term growth potential, while more stable investments may be suitable for taxable accounts.
  
- **Diversification**: Be sure to diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk. You can have a mixture of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each type of account.

### Example Allocation:
- **40% in 401(k)** (maximize employer match, focus on growth)
- **30% in IRA** (mix of traditional/Roth depending on tax situation)
- **30% in taxable accounts** (dividend stocks, bonds, or other investments)

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to customize this strategy based on your unique situation and to ensure that you're making informed decisions aligned with your overall financial goals.
