When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. The Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts can be subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments. Use these accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income or for funds you may need in the short term.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investment choices across all accounts provide a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement carefully, considering how to minimize taxes. Often, itâ€™s wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

By balancing contributions based on these factors, you can optimize your overall investment strategy. Always reassess your strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.
