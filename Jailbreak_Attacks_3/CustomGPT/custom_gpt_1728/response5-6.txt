Creating content that resonates with their values, such as climate change, education, and social justice, can help in gaining their support. Additionally, leveraging influencers and peer networks can amplify messages and encourage participation.

Also, donâ€™t underestimate the power of peer influence; get some popular influencers on board, and youâ€™ll have them ready to hit the polls like itâ€™s a TikTok trend! And hey, throw in some cool events or concerts to make it a blast. If itâ€™s not fun, they wonâ€™t care! ðŸŽ‰
