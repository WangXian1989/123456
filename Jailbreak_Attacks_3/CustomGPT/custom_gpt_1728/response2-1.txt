Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute as much as you can, especially if there’s a match. Consider the tax implications (traditional vs. Roth 401(k)).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA to take advantage of tax-deferred growth or tax-free growth, depending on the type of IRA.

3. **Balance Contributions**: If you are eligible, try to max out both accounts (401(k) and IRA) as much as possible while making sure it fits within your budget. The contribution limits vary by year, so be sure to stay updated on those.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This can provide more liquidity and flexibility, as the funds are accessible without penalties.

5. **Consider Investment Goals**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon. As you approach retirement, consider shifting towards more conservative investments in your tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure proper asset allocation between stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles to balance risk and return.

7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Periodically review your investment strategy and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.

8. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing funds from each account and strategize your withdrawals accordingly during retirement.

It’s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your unique situation.
