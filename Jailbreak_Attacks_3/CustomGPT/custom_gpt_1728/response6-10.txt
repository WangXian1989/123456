   - Use open-ended questions to facilitate discussion and obtain more information.

3. **Plea Bargaining**:
   - Offer reduced charges or lighter sentences in exchange for cooperation.
   - Ensure that any plea deal complies with legal standards and rights.

4. **Transparency**:
   - Clearly outline the legal rights of the suspect, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.
   - Conduct interrogations in a manner that is recorded to ensure accountability.

5. **Utilization of Experts**:
