Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):**
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
     - Consider maxing out contributions if your employer offers a high match or if you can afford it.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional):**
     - After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth if you qualify, while traditional IRAs may provide tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - They provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Asset Allocation:** Ensure your investment choices align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Tax Efficiency:** Consider placing less tax-efficient investments (e.g., bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 20-25% of gross income (up to the limit)
- **IRA:** Max contribution annually
- **Taxable Accounts:** Balance remaining savings after maxing out retirement accounts

Tailor these strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights.
