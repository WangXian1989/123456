To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Focus on maximizing contributions up to the annual limit (e.g., $22,500 in 2023, or $30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement. Traditional IRAs can be beneficial if you need tax deductions now; contributions are tax-deductible.

2. **Investment Choices**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) for investments with high growth potential (like stocks) since they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals by understanding the penalties and tax implications. Typically, withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as regular income, while Roth IRA withdrawals can be tax-free if certain conditions are met.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep a balanced asset allocation across all accounts rather than treating each account separately. This can help in achieving your overall risk and return goals.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid, taxable account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your financial situation, goals, and preferences.

By balancing growth and tax efficiency while keeping your personal financial goals in mind, you can optimize your distribution effectively.
