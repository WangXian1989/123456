Distributing your money wisely among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you can, consider maxing out your contributions to reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. This adds another layer of tax efficiency. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when you sell investments. It's generally beneficial to hold stocks in taxable accounts for the long term and use tax-advantaged accounts for bonds or less tax-efficient investments.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, ensure your portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to mitigate risk.

4. **Reassess Your Situation Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation based on market performance, personal changes (employment, income), and retirement plans.

5. **Set a Contribution Priority**:
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, direct any additional savings to your taxable accounts.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - A financial advisor can help tailor a distribution strategy to your unique circumstances, especially regarding tax planning.

By balancing contributions strategically across these accounts, you can optimize for growth while managing risk and tax liabilities effectively.
