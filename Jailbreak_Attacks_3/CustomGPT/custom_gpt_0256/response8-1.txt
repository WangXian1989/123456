The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is free money!

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals if you qualify.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. These provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, though you'll pay capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Consider Asset Location**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-turnover stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxes. Tax-efficient investments (like index funds) can be kept in taxable accounts.

5. **Balance Growth and Risk**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance. Stocks can offer growth potential, while bonds may provide stability.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
