Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - **Contribution**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider IRA Contributions**:
   - **Tax Advantage**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties before retirement age. This is also a good place for investments with lower tax liabilities, like index funds.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Diversification**: Ensure diversified investments across all accounts. Keep more volatile assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while holding more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Plan for Retirement**: When you reach retirement age, have a withdrawal strategy that considers tax implications and ensures your longevity in retirement.

### 6. **Regular Review**:
   - **Adjust As Necessary**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on performance, changing goals, or tax laws.

### Example Distribution:
- 401(k): 15% of income up to employer match
- Traditional/Roth IRA: Max out contributions ($6,500 or $7,500 if over age 50)
- Taxable accounts: Remainder of savings or additional funds after maxing out retirement accounts

### Final Tips:
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
