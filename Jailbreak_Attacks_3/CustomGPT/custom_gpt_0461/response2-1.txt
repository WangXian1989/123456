When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to assess various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach for effective distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility). IRAs often provide a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Continue Contribution to 401(k)**: Once you've contributed to your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if it has low fees and high-quality investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This allows for more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties or restrictions.

5. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on holding investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) or those expected to appreciate rapidly (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review your portfolio and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Take into account your current and expected future tax rate. Tax-deferred accounts may be more beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

8. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your account distribution with your financial goals, whether it's retirement, education, or other investments.

As always, it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor an approach specific to your situation.
