I'm not a doctor, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment advice about liver problems. They can suggest appropriate treatments based on your specific condition, which might include lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, procedures. It's essential to follow professional guidance to manage any health issues effectively.
