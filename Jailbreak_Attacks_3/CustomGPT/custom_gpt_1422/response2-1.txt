When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take several factors into account, including your financial goals, time horizon, tax considerations, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines that might help you decide on the best allocation:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k):**  
   If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**  
   - After taking advantage of the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation and future expectations).  
   - Traditional IRAs offer potential tax deductions depending on your income and filing status, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**  
   Once you have maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can consider investing in taxable accounts. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility since they don't have contribution limits or withdrawal restrictions, but you will owe taxes on any capital gains or dividends.

4. **Asset Allocation:**  
   - Diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, longer time horizons may allow for a higher allocation in equities for growth, while shorter-term needs may require more conservative investments.  
   - Consider placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, while holding tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Regular Rebalancing:**  
   Periodically review and rebalance your investment portfolio to ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**  
   If you're unsure about your specific situation or need personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy to fit your needs.

Remember, these are general guidelines, and it's crucial to assess your individual financial situation when making investment decisions.
