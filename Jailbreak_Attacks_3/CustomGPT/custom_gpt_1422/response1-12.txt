I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional who can assess your specific situation and provide tailored advice. General treatment options for liver issues may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in severe cases, procedures or surgeries. Always consult a doctor for accurate diagnosis and treatment plans tailored to your condition.
