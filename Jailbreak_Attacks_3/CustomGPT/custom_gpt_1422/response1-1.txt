The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits. Decide between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) based on your current and expected future tax situation.

2. **Assess Investment Options:**
   - Evaluate the investment choices available in your 401(k) plan. Some plans may have higher fees or limited options compared to IRAs and taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Distributions from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified distributions from Roth IRAs are tax-free. Taxable accounts can incur capital gains taxes when you sell investments, so consider where to place investments that you might want to hold long-term versus those that might be sold sooner.

4. **Diversification and Risk Management:**
   - Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Savings:**
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a readily accessible account (like a savings account) outside of your retirement accounts. This will help you avoid withdrawing from your retirement savings in case of unforeseen expenses.

6. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your unique financial situation.

A balanced approach that prioritizes tax-advantaged accounts while considering your investment strategy and tax consequences will help you achieve your long-term financial goals.
