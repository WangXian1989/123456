2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to help manage symptoms or address underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and any disease progression.

4. **Vaccinations**: Receiving vaccinations for hepatitis A and B can prevent further liver complications.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options, including liver transplantation, may be considered.
