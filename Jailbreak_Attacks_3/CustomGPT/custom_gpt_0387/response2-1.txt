When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider various factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here's a sudo code outline of the thought process:

```plaintext
1. Assess Financial Goals:
   - Define short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals.
   - Identify retirement needs.

2. Analyze Tax Implications:
   - 401(k): Tax-deferred growth; taxes due on withdrawal.
   - IRA: Traditional (tax-deferred) vs. Roth (tax-free withdrawal).
   - Taxable Accounts: Taxes on dividends and capital gains.

3. Evaluate Risk Tolerance:
   - Determine your comfort level with market fluctuations.

4. Establish an Investment Strategy:
   - Allocate assets based on goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.
   - Consider the use of target-date funds or diversified portfolios.

5. Prioritize Contributions:
   - Max out employer match on 401(k).
   - Contribute to IRA (both Traditional and Roth if eligible).
   - Invest excess funds in taxable accounts.

6. Reassess Regularly:
   - Review your asset allocation annually.
   - Adjust based on performance and changes in goals/life circumstances.
