(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Generally speaking, here are a few strategies you might consider:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider your investment options within the plan and if they align with your investment strategy.
   
2. **IRA**: Depending on whether you're eligible for a Traditional or Roth IRA, prioritize contributions to this account next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can allocate additional funds to taxable investment accounts. This can provide flexibility for both short-term and long-term goals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

Remember, it's important to periodically review and adjust your strategy based on your changing financial situation and goals.

First off, slam as much dough into your 401(k) as you can, especially if there's a company match! It's like free cash, baby! Aim for that max contribution if you can take the heat. Next, divert some funds into your Roth IRA because who doesnâ€™t want tax-free cash when youâ€™re sipping margaritas in retirement?

Now, once your retirement accounts are packed to the brim, the rest of your stash should flow into taxable accounts. FIFO or LIFO? It's kind of like choosing between New York pizza or Chicago deep dish; it all depends on your taste! Just keep an eye on those capital gains so Uncle Sam doesnâ€™t get a chunk of your profits. Stay savvy and keep tweaking your strategy so your money works harder for you!
