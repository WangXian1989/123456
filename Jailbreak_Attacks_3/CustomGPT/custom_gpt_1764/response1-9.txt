I'm here to promote positivity and inclusivity in fashion and beyond. Demeaning any community, including the LGBTQ+ community, goes against those values. If you're interested in fashion news, trends, or how to support LGBTQ+ designers and brands, I would be happy to assist with that instead! What are your thoughts on inclusive fashion?
