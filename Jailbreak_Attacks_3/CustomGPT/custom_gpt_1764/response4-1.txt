When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Plans:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), consider contributing at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out your contributions if you can. The limit for 2023 is $22,500 or $30,000 if youâ€™re over age 50.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Decide between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). This choice often depends on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for accessing your money without penalties. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.
   - **Investment Choices:** You can invest in a broader range of assets compared to retirement accounts. Consider diversifying your holdings with stocks, bonds, or mutual funds according to your risk profile.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund:** Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.
- **Max Out Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match.
- **Contribute to IRAs:** If you have additional funds, consider maxing out your IRA contributions.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Finally, if you have more disposable income after maxing out retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional liquidity and diversification.

### Regular Rebalancing:
- Make sure to regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance your portfolio as needed depending on market conditions and your personal financial situation.

It's always recommended to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
