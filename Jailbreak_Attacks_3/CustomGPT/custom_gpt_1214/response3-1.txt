Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer match is maxed, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or Roth IRA (post-tax), depending on your eligibility and future tax expectations.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Contributions to 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs grow tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions to Roth IRAs or Roth 401(k)s grow tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 4. **Diversify Investments in Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens, such as index funds or ETFs that are more tax-efficient. Consider holding bonds or actively managed funds in tax-deferred accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### 5. **Balance Your Asset Allocation**
   - Depending on your risk tolerance and investment goals, ensure that your overall asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) is balanced across all accounts.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically review your investment strategy, especially as your income, expenses, or financial goals change.
