Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you’re over 50).
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) for tax advantages. The limit is $6,500 for 2024 (or $7,500 for those 50+).

### 2. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Focus on higher-growth investments (like stocks) here since you won’t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate lower taxed income (like qualified dividends and long-term capital gains). Consider holding fixed-income investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high tax rates on interest income.

### 3. **Risk Tolerance:**
   - Align your asset allocation with your risk tolerance across all accounts. Younger investors might lean towards stocks, while those closer to retirement may favor bonds and safer investments.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs:**
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity for short-term needs in your taxable account, while keeping long-term growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk. 

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out to employer match first, then contribute to reach the max limit.
- **IRA:** Contribute enough to either a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax strategy.
- **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest any additional savings here, focusing on tax-efficient funds.

### Regular Review:
- Periodically review and adjust your contributions and asset allocation based on changes in income, tax laws, and investment performance.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
