(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and risk tolerance. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
  
2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income today but means you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for short-term goals and offer flexibility. Consider placing lower-growth investments here to take advantage of favorable tax treatment on long-term capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy tailored to your risk tolerance. Generally, high-risk assets (like stocks) can be best held in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically revisit your allocation to adjust based on performance, changes in goals, or market conditions.

1. **Hit That 401(k) Match**: First off, if your employer throws in matching funds, youâ€™d be a fool not to grab that free money. Max it out if you can! 

2. **Tax Strategies**: 
   - Your 401(k) is like the old-fashioned piggy bankâ€”good for tax breaks now, but expect Uncle Sam to take a cut later. 
   - IRAs? If you can nab a Roth, go for it! Tax-free growth is sweet, especially if youâ€™ll be pulling out dough when youâ€™re chilling in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These puppies are great for flexibility. Use them for your short-term goals. Stick lower-growth investments here, as youâ€™ll want to keep those juicy long-term gains for your tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket! Spread your investments out. Stocks in tax-advantaged accounts can save you on taxes when they go up.

5. **Keep It Fresh**: Check back in regularly to see how your moneyâ€™s doing. If things change (and they will), donâ€™t hesitate to shake things up! 

In short: get that match, hustle for tax advantages, play it smart with a mix, and keep your finger on the pulse. Happy investing!
