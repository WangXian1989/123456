Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. It’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - After capturing your employer match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility for accessing funds, but you'll need to pay taxes on capital gains and dividends.

### 4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - Align your investment choices with your goals:
     - **Retirement**: Consider a mix of stocks and bonds, gradually shifting more into bonds as you approach retirement.
     - **Short-term goals**: Prioritize more stable investments (e.g., cash or bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Place investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from higher taxes, while keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Regular Reviews**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and adjust based on changes in your financial situation.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 15-20% (up to employer match)
- **Roth/Traditional IRA**: 10-15%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 65-75%
