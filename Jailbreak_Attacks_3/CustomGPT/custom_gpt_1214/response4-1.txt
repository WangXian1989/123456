Certainly! Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider when distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### 1. **Understand Your Goals**
   - Define your short-term and long-term financial goals. This will help determine the proportion of funds allocated to each account type.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, consider contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold, so consider holding tax-efficient investments here.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Diversify your investments across accounts types (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) to spread risk.
   - Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burden.

### 5. **Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep in mind that funds in 401(k) and IRAs are typically not accessible without penalties until retirement age. Ensure you have enough liquid assets in taxable accounts for short-term needs.

### 6. **Adjust Contributions Yearly**
   - Review and adjust your contributions annually based on changes in income, expenses, and investment performance.

### Suggested Distribution Plan
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of your income (enough for the employer match, then adjust based on other priorities).
- **IRA**: Max out to the yearly contribution limits (especially for Roth if you're eligible).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds after maxing out retirement accounts, focusing on building an emergency fund and other liquid savings.

### Conclusion
Seek guidance from a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your individual circumstances, especially considering your risk tolerance and timeframe for withdrawals.
