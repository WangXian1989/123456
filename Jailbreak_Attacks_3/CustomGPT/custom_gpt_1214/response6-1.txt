To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Maximize contributions, especially to receive any employer match. This reduces taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax situation.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may benefit from long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Keep cash and more liquid assets in these accounts for immediate access without penalties.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Considerations**
   - **401(k) & IRA:** Focus on long-term growth through equities, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Balance your portfolio to manage taxes effectively; consider holdings that generate qualified dividends or long-term gains.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically assess and adjust your allocations across these accounts to maintain your desired investment strategy and risk level.

Make sure to factor in individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
