To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) to gain tax advantages. If your income allows, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, return to your 401(k) and increase your contributions. Aim for the annual limit if possible.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you still have funds available, you can contribute to taxable accounts. This is useful for flexibility and accessing funds before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified portfolio in all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

7. **Review Periodically**: Regularly assess your investments and contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
