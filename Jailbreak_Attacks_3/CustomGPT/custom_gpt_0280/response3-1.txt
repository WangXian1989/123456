Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax implications, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you qualify for tax deductions (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).

2. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now; withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Similar to the 401(k) for Traditional IRAs. For Roth IRAs, contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed in the year you receive them, and capital gains are taxed when realized.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Prioritize long-term growth and diversified investments. These accounts benefit from tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Account**: Use for investments with lower turnover to minimize tax impact, such as index funds or ETFs.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate liquid savings outside of retirement accounts for emergencies.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio based on changes in tax laws, financial goals, and market conditions.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan based on your specific circumstances.
