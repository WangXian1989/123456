To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your savings over time.

3. **IRA Considerations**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth on withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate money to taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility for withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Generally, keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax benefits.

6. **Regular Reassessment**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions and investment allocations as your financial situation and goals change.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
