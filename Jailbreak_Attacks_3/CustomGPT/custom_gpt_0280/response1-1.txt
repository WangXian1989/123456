To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum limit if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, consider putting extra funds into a taxable account. This gives you access to funds without penalties for early withdrawal.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments within each account are diversified to minimize risk and maximize potential returns.

5. **Review Contributions Regularly**: Reassess your contributions annually and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

6. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Utilize tax-deferred accounts for high-income years and Roth accounts during lower-income years to maximize tax efficiency.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before heavily investing.
