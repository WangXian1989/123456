Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. Maximize Employer Contributions
- **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
  
### 2. Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **IRA Contributions**: Contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax strategy. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.

### 3. Balance for Flexibility
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you may need access to before retirement or to manage capital gains.

### Considerations
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust investments according to your risk profile. Higher-risk assets might be better in tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for how and when you'll withdraw funds in retirement to optimize tax implications.

### Suggested Allocation
- **401(k)**: Max out employer match, then consider IRAs.
- **IRA**: Full contribution if eligible.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate funds after utilizing tax-advantaged accounts.
