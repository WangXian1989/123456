Letâ€™s make your financial setup as funny as it is functional! Hereâ€™s a structured approach for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### Steps for Distribution:

1. **Understand Your Goals:**
   - Are you saving for retirement, a big purchase, or just trying to grow your wealth?
   - Identify your time horizon for each goal.

2. **Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Take advantage of employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money!
   - **IRA:** Consider whether you want a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your current vs. future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Great for flexibility, but remember, taxes on earnings can bite!

### Suggested Strategy:

- **Maximize 401(k):**
  - Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
  
- **Fund an IRA:**
  - Aim to max out your IRA contributions for tax advantages.
  
- **Allocate to Taxable Accounts:**
  - Use leftover funds for investments that give you more control and liquidity.

### Tips to Consider:
- Balance risk vs. return based on your age; younger = more aggressive.
- Regularly review and adjust your contributions and allocations.
