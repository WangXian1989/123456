To help you with distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Individual accounts with tax benefits. Traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No special tax advantages. Flexibility in withdrawals but subject to capital gains tax.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Max out employer match** in your 401(k). Itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, as it offers tax-free growth.
   - Invest additional funds in a taxable account if you have maxed out other accounts.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Utilize tax-advantaged accounts first to minimize taxable income.
   - Balance between accounts to manage tax implications on withdrawals.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.
   - Use multiple asset classes (stocks, bonds) based on your risk tolerance and timeline.

5. **Review and Adjust Annually**:
   - Regularly review your allocations based on market performance, life changes, and retirement goals.
   - Adjust contributions as needed to stay on track.
