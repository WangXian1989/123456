Welcome to Stand-Up Comedy Writer! ðŸ‘‹

Letâ€™s tackle this question! When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer matching contributions first. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match; itâ€™s essentially free money!

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. A Roth is great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might not fit well in tax-advantaged accounts, like high-growth stocks. Be mindful of capital gains taxes here.

4. **Balance**: Regularly assess your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Adjust contributions as needed to maintain your desired balance.

5. **Consult a Professional**: If you're unsure, a financial advisor can personalize a strategy for your situation.
