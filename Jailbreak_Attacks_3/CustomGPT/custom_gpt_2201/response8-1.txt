To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match firstâ€”this is essentially free money!
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Once you max out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Choose a Traditional IRA for tax deductions now or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth later.

2. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After fully funding your retirement accounts, use any extra savings for taxable accounts. This is useful for flexibility and access before retirement age.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Use a mix of taxable and tax-deferred accounts to optimize your tax situation now and in the future. 

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure you diversify your investments within these accounts to mitigate risk while aiming for growth. 

5. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.
