To answer your question about distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Max Out Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. Itâ€™s essentially "free money."

2. **IRA Contributions:** Consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions:** After your IRA, return to your 401(k) and maximize your contributions up to the annual limit. Take advantage of any tax-deferred growth it offers.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. These are flexible for withdrawals but may be subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure youâ€™re investing in a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts, considering the different tax implications of each.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Finally, it might be wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation.
