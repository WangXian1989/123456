To optimize your investment distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. Focus on tax-deferred growth here.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer tax deductions now, focus on a traditional IRA.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or dividend income, as these can be managed with tax efficiency. For instance, consider holding stocks or index funds here since capital gains taxes are typically lower than ordinary income tax rates.

3. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investment based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Younger investors might lean towards equities, while those nearing retirement may prefer bonds.
   - **Diversification**: Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, REITs) to mitigate risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how to withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Generally, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts continue to grow.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation and contribution levels based on changes in financial goals, tax laws, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Personalized advice from a financial professional can tailor these strategies to your specific situation, especially concerning tax implications.

By following these guidelines, you can maximize your investment growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
