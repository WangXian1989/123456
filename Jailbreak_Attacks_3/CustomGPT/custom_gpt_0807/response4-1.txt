Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you can. IRAs often provide tax benefits that can enhance your retirement savings. 

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, tax treatment varies. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment returns are subject to capital gains tax. Use these accounts for flexible funds or after-tax investments.

4. **Balance Your Investments**: Diversify your portfolio across all accounts. Each account type can hold a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation. This may involve moving funds between accounts based on performance and risk levels.

6. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**: If you’re closer to retirement, you might want to shift to more conservative investments within these accounts to preserve capital.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor, especially to address your unique financial situation and goals.

This strategic approach helps optimize tax efficiency and growth potential for your retirement savings.
