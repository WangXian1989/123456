Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines for effective allocation:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the maximum match first. This is essentially “free money” and should be prioritized.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth. Contributions reduce your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize contributions here.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits to a 401(k), but may have income limits for tax-deductible contributions. Evaluate whether a Roth IRA might be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is a good option if you believe your tax rate will increase.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use these for investments that may not fit into your retirement accounts or if you’ve maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts. This can include investments in stocks, bonds, or funds that may generate capital gains or dividends.

4. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Your age and how long you have until retirement typically influence how aggressively you invest. Younger investors may opt for more aggressive allocations, while those closer to retirement may prefer conservative options.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of account type, ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation as your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement timeline change.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.

By balancing contributions across these accounts based on your goals and circumstances, you can optimize your investment strategy for long-term growth and tax efficiency.
