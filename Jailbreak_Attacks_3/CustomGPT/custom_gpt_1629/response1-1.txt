Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Advantages**
   - **Traditional IRA/401(k):** Contributions are often tax-deductible (for traditional accounts), which can reduce your taxable income now. Consider maxing out these accounts first if your income allows.
   - **Roth IRA:** If you qualify based on income limits, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, where withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 3. **Investment Options and Fees**
   - Compare the investment options and fees in your 401(k) with those available in IRAs or taxable accounts. You might find better choices outside of your 401(k).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Utilize taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access before retirement, as they offer more flexibility without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient vehicles (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Within each account type, ensure a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 6. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - Consider your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Tax implications differ based on the account type, so plan your distributions to minimize taxes.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're unsure about the best approach, it may be helpful to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific situation.

Each person's financial situation is unique, so these considerations should be adjusted based on your needs and goals.
