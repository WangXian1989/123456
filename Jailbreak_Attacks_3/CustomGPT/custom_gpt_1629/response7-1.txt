Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match**: Always aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing taxable income now. Consider maxing out contributions if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment options within the plan; some plans may have high fees or limited choices.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older). Consider contributing to this once you've maximized your 401(k) match.
   - **Tax Considerations**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Provides more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Good for medium-term goals (e.g., buying a home or funding education).
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: Be mindful of taxes on any gains when selling investments. Long-term investments (held for over a year) are taxed at a lower rate.

### **Distribution Strategy**
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any company match.
2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If eligible, contribute to either a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation.
3. **Max Out 401(k)**: If possible, increase your 401(k) contributions to the annual maximum limit.
4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, focus on investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

### **Regular Review**
- **Rebalance**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments based on changing goals and market conditions.
- **Adjust Contributions**: As income increases or financial goals change, adjust your contributions accordingly.
