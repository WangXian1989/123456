Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. If possible, max out your contribution limit.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as this allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are best for investments that generate lower taxes, such as long-term capital gains or qualified dividends. Use these accounts for more liquid needs.

### 3. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**
   - **Equities in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Bonds in Taxable Accounts:** Since bond interest is taxed at ordinary income rates, holding bonds in taxable accounts may be less tax-efficient.

### 4. **Rebalancing and Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement for tax efficiency, as it may keep you in a lower tax bracket longer.

### 5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice can help tailor these strategies based on your financial situation and goals.

### Example Distribution
- Contribute to your 401(k) up to the match.

- Use any surplus for taxable accounts.

Adjust your strategy as your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions change.
