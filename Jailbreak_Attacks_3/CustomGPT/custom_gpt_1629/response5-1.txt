Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Max out contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Generally allows for higher contribution limits and may have lower administrative fees. Ideal for pre-tax contributions (Traditional) or Roth contributions if offered.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages but typically has lower contribution limits. A Roth IRA can be valuable for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for any mid-term savings goals, as it provides more flexibility.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Be mindful of tax implications for taxable accounts (e.g., capital gains taxes).

### 4. **Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired risk level.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider consulting with a financial planner for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

This strategy helps in maximizing growth while minimizing tax burdens as you approach retirement.
