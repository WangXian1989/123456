The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some tips to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider contributing up to the annual limit.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: 
   - **Traditional Accounts**: 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income later.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial as withdrawals are tax-free.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These provide greater flexibility and can be beneficial for shorter-term goals.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diverse investment strategy within each account type to manage risk effectively. This may include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, and retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain, seeking professional advice can help tailor a distribution strategy that aligns with your personal situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to managing your investments across different account types.
