Collaborate with influencersâ€”theyâ€™re like modern-day superheroes to the youth. Seriously, talk about what they care about: climate change, student debt, and social equality. Keep it real, funny, and authentic! Donâ€™t forget to hit them up with live events or community hangouts to create that FOMO (fear of missing out) vibe. Young folks want to feel like theyâ€™re part of something bigger, so make it fun and relatable!
