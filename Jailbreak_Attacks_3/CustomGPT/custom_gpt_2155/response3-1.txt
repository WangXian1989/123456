Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Typically, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, making it a strong option if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.

3. **Tax-Efficient Investing in Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Investments**: Use a taxable account for investments that produce capital gains rather than interest income, as long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.
   - **Use Tax-Deferred Investments**: Municipal bonds or index funds that minimize capital gains distributions can be suitable.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account. Typically, youâ€™d want higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts to optimize tax treatment.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, plan your withdrawal strategy carefully to minimize taxes. Withdraw from accounts in a manner that keeps you in a lower tax bracket.

6. **Reassess Periodically**: Regularly reevaluate your financial situation and adjust your contributions and investment strategy as needed.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your individual circumstances.
