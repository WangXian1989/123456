Investing and distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider the investment fees associated with your plan.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Max Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing the maximum allowed to an IRA. Decide between a Traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals) based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Growth Potential**: IRAs often provide a wider selection of investment options than 401(k) plans.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Consider placing investments that benefit from favorable long-term capital gains tax rates, like index funds or ETFs.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved first.
- **Aggressive Growth**: If you're young or have a long investment horizon, focus more on your 401(k) and IRA for tax-advantaged growth.
- **Balanced Approach**: Consider a blend based on your age, risk tolerance, and goals—perhaps 50% in 401(k), 30% in IRA, and 20% in taxable, adjusting as needed.

### Regular Reviews:
- Evaluate your portfolio regularly and adjust contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and market conditions.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
- For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals, consider seeking professional guidance.

This multi-faceted approach should help you optimize your investment strategy.
