The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Matching**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth**: Decide between pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth) contributions based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: Like the 401(k), consider your current tax situation. Traditional IRAs provide tax benefits now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need to access before retirement age without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider municipal bonds, index funds, or ETFs to minimize taxes on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and changes in your risk tolerance.

Consulting a financial advisor can further tailor the approach to your specific circumstances.
