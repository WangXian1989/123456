Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Employer Match**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first—you don’t want to leave free money on the table.

2. **Debt Payoff**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before investing heavily.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses before diving deep into investments.

4. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Good for higher contribution limits and possibly employer matching. Consider investing more here if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax-free growth (Roth IRA) or tax-deferred growth (Traditional IRA). Consider maxing out your IRA after your 401(k) match.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts, especially if you plan to access funds before retirement age or for specific goals (e.g., buying a house).

6. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and specific goals. 

7. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.
