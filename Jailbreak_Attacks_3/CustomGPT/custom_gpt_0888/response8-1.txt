Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general guideline to help you make informed decisions:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding an IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Any earnings (dividends, interest, capital gains) are subject to taxes in the year they are realized.

### 3. **Assess Your Time Horizon:**
   - If you’re saving for long-term goals (retirement), prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals, consider maintaining a balance in taxable accounts for easier access.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### 5. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens since they typically have lower turnover.
   - Consider holding bonds or other interest-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid taxes on interest income.

### 6. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and ensure it aligns with your goals.
   - Rebalance as needed to maintain your target allocations.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of income up to the employer match, then additional for max contribution.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions ($6,500 for those under 50, $7,500 for those 50+) if eligible.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings can be directed here, particularly for shorter-term goals.

### Conclusion:
Tailor this strategy to your specific situation, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance. They can help you navigate tax implications and investment strategies that align with your overall financial plan.
