Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and the rules governing these accounts. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if you have a matching contribution.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), contribute to your IRA, whether traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’re maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate money to taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility but come with capital gains tax on profits.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts might be wise. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket, traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts.

6. **Diversification**: Keep a balanced and diversified portfolio in all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment timeframe.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation and goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consulting a financial advisor can be beneficial.

This strategy helps maximize growth potential while managing tax implications effectively.
