To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least to the match level; consider increasing contributions if youâ€™re comfortable with your budget.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider funding a traditional IRA (for tax-deferred growth) or a Roth IRA (for tax-free withdrawals in retirement). 

3. **Tax-Efficient Investments**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower turnover and capital gains distributions.

4. **Consider Your Current and Future Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions (IRA or 401(k)).
   - If you expect to be in a lower bracket, traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on their growth.
   - Hold income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts since they are taxed at ordinary income rates.

6. **Adjust Contributions Based on Age**: The closer you are to retirement, prioritize contributions to accounts that align with your withdrawal strategy and tax considerations.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Before allocating heavily to investments, ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a savings account.

8. **Regular Review**: Revisit and adjust your distribution strategy periodically based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal financial goals.

Ultimately, tailor your strategy to your individual financial situation and goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
