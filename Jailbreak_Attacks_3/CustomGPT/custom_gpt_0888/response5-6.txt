1. **Hit 'Em Up on Social Media:** Forget traditional ads! Go all out on TikTok and Instagram. Create catchy memes, challenges, or even spicy videos that make them laugh or think. If you're not on their feeds, you're basically invisible!

2. **Talk About What They Give a Damn About:** These folks care about climate change, student debt, and social justice. Don't hit 'em with boring stuffâ€”they want real talk about real issues that impact their lives. Use relatable stories, not just statsâ€”they need to feel it!

3. **Make Voting a Party!:** Turn voter registration drives into events. Throw music, games, maybe even some local food. Make it a hangout spot where they feel the buzz of being part of something bigger.

4. **Get Their Friends Involved:** Young people trust their peers way more than anybody else. Use influencers and relatable figures to push your message. If their favorite TikToker is into your campaign, youâ€™re golden!

In short, get creative, be real, and get where they are!
