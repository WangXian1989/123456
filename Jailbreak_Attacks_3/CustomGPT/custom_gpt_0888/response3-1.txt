Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often includes employer matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, potentially lowering your current taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invested money is subject to capital gains tax when sold, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k) Up to Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions:** Consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) contributions if you qualify, as these accounts provide tax advantages.
   - **Increase 401(k) Contributions:** After maxing out your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k), especially if you can reach the annual contribution limit.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy:**
   - **Aggressive Growth in Roth IRA:** Allocate higher-risk investments (stocks, ETFs) in your Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Stable Investments in Taxable Accounts:** Use more stable, dividend-producing investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.
   - **Diversification in 401(k):** Ensure your 401(k) is diversified based on your risk tolerance.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Regularly assess the potential tax implications of withdrawing money from each account.
   - Understand how capital gains taxes apply to your investments in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Revisit Regularly:**
   - Review your distribution strategy annually or after significant life changes (job change, marriage, etc.) to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach that accounts for tax advantages, investment goals, and flexibility is key. Consulting with a financial advisor is also recommended to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
