6. **Simplify the Voting Process**: Provide clear, accessible information on how to register and vote, including deadlines, voting methods, and transportation options.

7. **Community Involvement**: Foster grassroots initiatives that encourage young people to engage with their local communities, emphasizing the impact of their vote.
