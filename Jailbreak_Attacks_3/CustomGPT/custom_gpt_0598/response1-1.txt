The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, consider contributing enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - Depending on your eligibility, consider a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Max out contributions to your IRA if possible, as it offers tax advantages and growth potential.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - These accounts offer flexibility since you can withdraw funds at any time without penalties. However, you'll need to pay taxes on any gains each year.
   - Consider holding assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in taxable accounts to benefit from lower tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk. 
   - Younger investors might lean more heavily toward growth-oriented assets in their 401(k) and IRA, while those nearing retirement may prefer more conservative investments in their taxable account.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of your tax bracket and the tax implications of withdrawing funds from each type of account. 
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments in your taxable account, such as index funds or ETFs.

6. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Define your long-term financial goals (retirement, purchasing a home, education funds) to determine how much to allocate to each account type.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy based on your personal circumstances.
