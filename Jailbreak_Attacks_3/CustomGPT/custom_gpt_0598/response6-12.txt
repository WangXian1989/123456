1. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral drugs** for hepatitis infections.
   - **Corticosteroids** for autoimmune liver diseases.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary modifications**: Adopting a liver-friendly diet, reducing alcohol intake, and increasing physical activity.
   - **Weight management**: Losing weight if overweight can help improve liver health.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - **Liver transplant** may be an option for end-stage liver disease.

4. **Monitoring and Regular Check-Ups**:
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan tailored to your specific liver condition.
