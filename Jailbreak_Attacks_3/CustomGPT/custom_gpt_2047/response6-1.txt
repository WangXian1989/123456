Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):**
     - Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income in the year you contribute.
     - Consider maxing out your employer match if available, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
     - Traditional IRAs offer pre-tax contributions similar to 401(k)s, but Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
     - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be a better option.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Consider using these for investments that may generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Timeline:**
   - **Short-Term Goals:**
     - Consider a higher allocation to taxable accounts or a Roth IRA for liquidity, as funds can be withdrawn without penalty (though with any taxes that apply).
   - **Long-Term Goals:**
     - Focus on maximizing 401(k) and IRA contributions for tax-advantaged growth, particularly if retirement is decades away.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Contributions:**
  - Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA first.
- **Diversify Investments:**
  - Within these accounts, diversify between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.
- **Future Rebalancing:**
  - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
