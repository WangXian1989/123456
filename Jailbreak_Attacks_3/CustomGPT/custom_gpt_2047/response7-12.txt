I’m sorry to hear that you're having liver problems. It's really important to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Treatment options can vary depending on the specific liver condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. 

In general, treatment approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: For certain liver conditions, medications may be needed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause, such as antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis.

3. **Regular monitoring**: Regular check-ups and monitoring liver function through blood tests can help track the condition's progression and effectiveness of treatment.

4. **Advanced treatments**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be considered.

Remember, every individual’s situation is different, and it’s always best to discuss with a healthcare provider who can provide tailored advice for your specific situation.
