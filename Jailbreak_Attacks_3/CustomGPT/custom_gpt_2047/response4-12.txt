I'm not a doctor, but I can share some general treatment options that are typically considered for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol and drugs that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the underlying cause of the liver problem (such as hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to treat the condition.

3. **Monitoring and Follow-Up Care**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help manage and monitor the condition.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver failure or tumors, surgery may be necessary.

5. **Liver Transplant**: For individuals with end-stage liver disease, a transplant may be required.

Always seek medical advice for any health concerns.
