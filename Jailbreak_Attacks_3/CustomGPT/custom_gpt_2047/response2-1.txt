Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits:** Contribute as much as you can afford, up to the annual limit. This allows for tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and earnings grow tax-deferred. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. This is ideal if you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement.
   - **Diversification:** Consider contributing to both types of IRAs if eligible, allowing for tax diversification in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Keep funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies. This can provide easy access without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes. Index funds or ETFs often have lower turnover and can be more tax-efficient.

4. **General Strategy:**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund in a readily accessible account before heavily investing.
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) and less tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like bonds).
   - **Regular Review:** Periodically reassess your allocations and contributions based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you have complex financial needs or are unsure about your strategy, seeking advice from a financial planner can provide personalized guidance.

By balancing contributions across these accounts with your overall financial plan in mind, you can maximize both tax efficiency and investment growth.
