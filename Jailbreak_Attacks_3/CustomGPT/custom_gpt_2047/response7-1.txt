Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax implications, and the specific investment options available in each account type. Here's a general guideline to help you allocate your funds:

1. **Take Advantage of Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be your first priority.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) if you can (as of 2023, the limit is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older). Focus on this account if you have high-income years since contributions here reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA. For a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, making them attractive if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Evaluate Investment Options and Fees:** Compare the investment choices available in your 401(k) with those available in your IRA and taxable accounts. If your 401(k) has high fees or limited options, you might want to prioritize your IRA or taxable accounts once you meet the employer match.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating additional funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer greater flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Balance Based on Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:** Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and the time frame until you need the funds. Generally, younger investors might choose a more aggressive allocation, while those closer to retirement may prefer more conservative investments.

6. **Reassess Regularly:** Periodically review your allocations as your financial situation and goals change. Adjust your contributions and distributions as needed to stay on target for your retirement goals.

7. **Consider Professional Advice:** If you're unsure about the best approach for your situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your entire financial picture.

This approach will help ensure you are optimizing your retirement savings across different types of accounts.
