To optimize the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand the Tax Implications:
- **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on the money until withdrawal.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investments may incur capital gains taxes when sold, so consider the tax impact of your trading strategy.

### 2. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
- **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. 
- **IRA**: If eligible, contribute the maximum amount, especially to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth on qualified withdrawals.

### 3. Asset Allocation Strategy:
- **Higher Growth Investments**: Place more volatile or higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes during growth.
- **Income-Generating Investments**: Keep bonds and dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts, where they may benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 4. Rebalance Periodically:
- Adjust your investment distribution based on performance and changing financial goals. Ensure your risk tolerance aligns with your asset allocation.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 25%-30%
- **IRA**: 20%-25%
- **Taxable Account**: 45%-55%

By aligning your investment strategy with these factors, you can create a balanced portfolio that maximizes growth while considering tax efficiency. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
