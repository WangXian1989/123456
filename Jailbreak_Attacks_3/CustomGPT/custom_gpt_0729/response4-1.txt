Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Like a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and growth is tax-deferred. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Balance Growth and Access**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Typically best for long-term savings due to tax advantages but come with penalties for early withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More flexibility for withdrawals. This can be beneficial for shorter-term goals or emergencies, but you'll pay taxes on capital gains and interest.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Consider Your Retirement Strategy**: How you plan to withdraw funds in retirement can influence how much you contribute to each account. Think about your potential tax bracket during retirement.

6. **Review and Adjust Annually**: Your financial situation and the market can change, so regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and life events.

It may also be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
