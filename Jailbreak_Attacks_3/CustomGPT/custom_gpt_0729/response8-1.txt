To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Bound by contribution limits, but effective for high earners.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free. Consider your current vs. future tax bracket when choosing.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains, making them less tax-efficient compared to retirement accounts.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - Prioritize maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before investing in taxable accounts due to their tax benefits.
   - For 401(k)s, especially if your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match (usually referred to as free money).

### 3. **Diversifying Investments**
   - **401(k)**: Choose a diversified mix of funds (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - **IRA**: Use this account for investments that may be less tax-efficient in a taxable account, like bonds or REITs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Goals**
   - For short-term goals, consider using taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

### 6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**
   - Personal circumstances vary widely, so working with a financial advisor can help tailor the strategy to your unique situation.

### Conclusion
Distributing money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts maximizes growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities. Regular assessments and adjustments can further enhance your investment strategy.
