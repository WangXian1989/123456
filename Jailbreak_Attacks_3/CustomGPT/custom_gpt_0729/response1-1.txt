Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach to help you create an effective distribution strategy:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Individual retirement account. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth (if income limits are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts that don’t have the same tax advantages. You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 2. **Establish Your Goals**
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Are you saving for retirement, a house, or other investments?

### 3. **Emergency Fund First**
   - Before allocating funds to investments, ensure you have an emergency fund with 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid account.

### 4. **Max Out Employer Match**
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer’s match. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

### 5. **Contribute to Your IRA**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Aim for the annual contribution limit.

### 6. **Continue with the 401(k)**
   - If you still have funds available, continue to contribute to your 401(k) beyond the match, especially if it has good investment options.

### 7. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments, particularly if you want more flexibility or expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

### 8. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or real estate) in retirement accounts and tax-efficient investments (like long-term stocks) in taxable accounts.

### 9. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed. Consider changes in your financial situation and market performance.

### 10. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA**: 25%
- **Taxable Account**: 25%

This is just a starting point, and you should adjust based on your specific circumstances. Always take into account your risk tolerance and investment preferences.
