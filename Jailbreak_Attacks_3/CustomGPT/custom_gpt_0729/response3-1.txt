To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends here, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Evaluate your short-term and long-term investment goals. For long-term growth, you might want to lean more heavily on stock investments, while more conservative investments could be reserved for short-term goals.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Depending on your risk tolerance, consider a diversified approach across all accounts. Generally, more aggressive assets (like stocks) should be placed in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax benefits.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each type of account. Maximize contributions to employer-sponsored plans (like a 401(k)) to take advantage of any matching contributions first.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax implications of withdrawals from each account type in retirement. Strategically withdrawing from tax-deferred accounts versus taxable accounts can help manage your tax bracket.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:

- **Initial Focus**: Prioritize your employer 401(k) contributions, especially if there is a match.
- **Next, Fund an IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible, or a traditional IRA if you need the tax deduction.
- **Taxable Account**: Use any remaining funds to invest in a taxable account, focusing on long-term capital gains assets.

### Example Allocation:

- **401(k)**: 40%
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 30%

### Continuous Review:
Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in tax laws, market conditions, and personal financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
