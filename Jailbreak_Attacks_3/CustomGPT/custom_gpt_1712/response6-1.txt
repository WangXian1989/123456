When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider your financial goals, tax implications, and the benefits of each account type. Hereâ€™s a general framework:

### **1. Understand Each Account Type**

- **401(k) Plans:**
  - Tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
  - Often includes employer matching contributions.

- **IRAs (Traditional and Roth):**
  - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible; tax is paid upon withdrawal.
  - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

- **Taxable Accounts:**
  - Flexibility in accessing funds.
  - Subject to capital gains tax on profits.

### **2. Distribution Strategy**

- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
  - **Prioritize 401(k) contributions** to get the full employer match.
  - If eligible, contribute to a **Roth IRA** for tax-free growth.

- **Consider Diversification:**
  - Balance between tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) and after-tax accounts (Roth IRA, taxable accounts).

- **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket:**
  - Consider your current and projected future tax rates to decide whether to use tax-deferred vs. after-tax contributions.

### **3. Regularly Review and Adjust**

- Monitor your investment performance and make adjustments based on your financial goals and changes in tax laws.

- Consider consulting a financial advisor or tax professional for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
