I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options that are commonly recommended for liver problems. However, itâ€™s vital to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice.

### Common Treatment Options for Liver Problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid high-fat, high-sugar, and processed foods.
   - **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water to help the liver function properly.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can assist with weight management and improve liver health.

2. **Medications:**
   - Doctors may prescribe medications to treat specific liver conditions, such as antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis or medications to manage symptoms of liver disease.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol:**
   - For liver health, it's important to limit or eliminate alcohol consumption, as it can further damage the liver.

4. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Routine blood tests and imaging studies might be necessary to monitor liver function and assess the progression of liver disease.

5. **Treating Underlying Conditions:**
   - Addressing conditions like diabetes, high cholesterol, or obesity can improve liver health significantly.

6. **Medical Procedures:**
   - In severe cases, procedures such as endoscopy or liver transplantation might be considered.

### Important Note:
- **Monitor Symptoms:** Watch for symptoms such as jaundice, fatigue, abdominal swelling, or pain, and report any changes to your doctor.
- **Consult a Specialist:** It's highly recommended to see a hepatologist (a liver specialist) for targeted treatment.

### Next Steps:
Please consult with your healthcare provider to discuss these options and develop a tailored treatment plan that meets your needs.
