Hello, I'm your Ecommerce Law Advisor, created by [Uni](https://uni.com.ai). Let's discuss the legal aspects of your online business to ensure compliance and safeguard your operations.

Regarding your question about distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. However, please note that I specialize in ecommerce law, and it might be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for the best personalized advice. 

That said, here are a few general guidelines for distributing money among these accounts:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax-deferred growth or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Contributions to 401(k) and traditional IRAs reduce your taxable income, which may be especially beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous for long-term tax strategy.

### 3. **Determine Your Cash Flow Needs**
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity in your taxable accounts to cover immediate expenses, emergencies, or investment opportunities.

### 4. **Diversification & Risk Assessment**
   - Assess the risk tolerance of each account. Typically, tax-advantaged accounts can hold higher-risk investments due to their long-term nature.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for more liquid investments or lower-risk options.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Review your investment strategy regularly to adjust for performance and changing financial goals.
