For your question about distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's crucial to consider several factors including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute at least enough to get any employer match; it's free money!
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits ($20,500 for those under 50 in 2022, and $27,000 for those 50 and older).

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth:** Choose between Traditional IRAs (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth IRAs (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2022, the contribution limit is $6,000 (or $7,000 if you're 50 or older).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Emergency Fund & Short-term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the short term or for emergencies, as they provide more liquidity.
   - **Investment Flexibility:** You can invest in a broader range of assets, but be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

### 4. **Balancing and Diversification**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy. 
   - **Diversification:** Consider diversifying across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

### Example Distribution Strategy
| Account Type  | Focus                          | Suggested Contribution   |
|---------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 401(k)        | Max out employer match         | 15% of salary            |
| IRA           | Tax-free growth                | $6,000 (if applicable)   |
| Taxable       | Short-term goal funding        | Remaining income          |

Always consult with a financial advisor to personalize this strategy based on your individual circumstances.
