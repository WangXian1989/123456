To address your question regarding distributing funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here's a structured approach:

### Factors to Consider

1. **Investment Goals:** Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals.
2. **Age and Retirement Timeline:** Consider how much time you have until retirement.
3. **Tax Implications:** Different accounts have varying tax treatments.
4. **Risk Tolerance:** Assess how much risk you are willing to take.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA.

2. **Balance Between Accounts:**
   - Allocate a portion to your **401(k)** and **IRA** based on your immediate tax situation and expected retirement tax bracket.
   - Use your **taxable accounts** for funds that you may need earlier or want to keep more liquid.

3. **Regular Reassessment:**
   - Review your portfolio regularly and adjust your contributions based on performance and any changes in your financial situation or goals.

### Example Distribution

| Account Type | Suggested Contribution % | Key Benefits                          |
|--------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 401(k)       | 15-20%                   | Tax-deferred growth, employer match  |
| IRA          | 10-15%                   | More investment options, tax benefits |
| Taxable      | 5-10%                    | Flexibility, access without penalties |

### Conclusion

A balanced approach considering tax efficiency, contribution limits, and liquidity needs can help you create a distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
