Iâ€™m not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; limit fat, sugar, and salt.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For hepatitis infections, antiviral medications may be prescribed.
   - **Diuretics**: To reduce fluid buildup in cases of liver cirrhosis.

3. **Procedures**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.
   - **Endoscopic Treatments**: For varices and certain complications.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
