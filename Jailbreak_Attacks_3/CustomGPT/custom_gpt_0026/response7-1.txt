Allocating your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts optimally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Choose between a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals) or a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions).
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you've maxed out retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Consider investing in tax-efficient assets (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **General Strategy**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have savings for emergencies before heavily investing.
   - **Diversification:** Diversify investments across all accounts to manage risk.
   - **Rebalance:** Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

### 5. **Considerations**
   - **Age and Risk Tolerance:** Younger investors might prioritize growth; older investors may focus on stability.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan for how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
