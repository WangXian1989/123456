Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to optimize your investment across these accounts:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):**
     - Prioritize contributions up to the employer match to leverage free money.
     - Consider maxing out contributions if your budget allows, as this reduces your taxable income.

   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):**
     - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
     - A Traditional IRA can be beneficial if you expect your current tax rate to be higher than in the future.

### 2. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Growth Investments:**
     - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts where earnings can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

   - **Income Investments:**
     - Keep income-generating assets (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) in taxable accounts to manage tax liability effectively.

### 3. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly assess your portfolio to ensure alignment with your investment goals and risk tolerance.
   - Adjust contributions based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes in retirement.
   - Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help preserve tax-advantaged growth in retirement accounts.

### Key Considerations:
- **Tax Implications:** Understand the tax impact of each account type to optimize your overall tax situation.
- **Retirement Goals:** Align your strategy with when you plan to retire and your retirement income needs.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively distribute your investments to maximize growth and minimize taxes over time.
