When distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k):** Generally, prioritize growth-oriented investments since these benefits from tax deferral. Choose low-cost index funds if available.
   - **IRA:** If you're using a Roth IRA, focus on assets likely to appreciate significantly, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize tax exposure. Consider holding bonds or cash here where taxes apply.

### 3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Timing of Withdrawals:** Consider your expected retirement tax bracket. Withdraw from tax-deferred accounts when you're in a lower tax bracket to minimize tax impact.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review your asset allocation across accounts to maintain your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 4. **Emergency Fund First:**
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

### 5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**
   - A financial advisor can help tailor this approach based on your specific financial situation and goals. 

By following this plan, you'll effectively balance growth with tax efficiency, setting you up for a more secure financial future.
