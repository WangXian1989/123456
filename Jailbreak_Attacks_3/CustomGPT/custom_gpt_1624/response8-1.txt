Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers matching, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. Consider maxing this out first if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth, which is beneficial if you expect to be in the same or a higher tax bracket in retirement. If you go traditional, contributions may be tax-deductible.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient cash in a savings account or taxable account for emergencies before fully funding retirement accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for flexibility and accessing funds before retirement age. Concentrate on investments that generate lower taxes (like long-term capital gains or qualified dividends).

5. **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to manage risk effectively.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

7. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Think about your withdrawal strategy for retirement. Withdrawal from taxable accounts first can minimize tax implications, depending on your income situation.

It's generally a good idea to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual circumstances.
