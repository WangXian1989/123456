I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a low-fat, high-fiber diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the issue, medications may include antivirals for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease, or drugs to reduce liver inflammation.

3. **Clinical Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) might be necessary to address blockages.

4. **Liver Transplant**:
   - For end-stage liver disease, a transplant may be considered.

5. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and progression.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
