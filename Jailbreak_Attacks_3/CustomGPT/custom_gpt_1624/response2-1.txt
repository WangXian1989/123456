Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions in a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment returns are taxed as capital gains when sold. Favor long-term investments to benefit from lower tax rates.

### 3. **Allocate Investments**
   - **401(k):** Choose a mix of stock and bond funds that align with your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA:** Similar strategy, but you might consider holding more aggressively positioned investments here.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation and respond to market changes.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** 10% of income (up to employer match)
- **IRA:** Maximum allowable contribution
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any remaining savings after maxing the above accounts
