The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA, especially if it offers tax advantages (Traditional vs. Roth IRA).

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of each account type. 401(k)s and IRAs grow tax-deferred, while taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes. 

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you plan to access funds soon, keep more money in taxable accounts to avoid penalties.
   - For long-term growth, focus on tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compounding.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account to spread risk.

6. **Review Regularly**: Life circumstances change, so review and adjust your allocations periodically based on your goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider working with a certified financial planner who can help tailor your strategy based on your unique situation.

Ultimately, a well-diversified approach that takes advantage of tax benefits while aligning with your retirement goals will be effective.
