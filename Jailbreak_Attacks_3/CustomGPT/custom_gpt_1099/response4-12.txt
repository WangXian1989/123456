I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for advice on liver problems. Treatment options can vary widely based on the specific condition and severity. General treatments might include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, surgery. Be sure to seek medical attention for a personalized plan.
