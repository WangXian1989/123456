To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions now.
   
### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which may have lower tax rates.
   - **Asset Placement**: Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes, and keep lower-growth, income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and strategically placing assets based on tax implications, you can optimize your retirement savings and minimize your overall tax liability.
