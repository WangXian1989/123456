When it comes to distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider a variety of factors including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies you can consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA accounts if you have not already. These accounts often provide tax benefits that can help grow your savings more efficiently than taxable accounts.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each type of account. For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older), while the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have any high-interest debt, consider using some of your funds to pay that down before contributing more to your accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes, even within your retirement accounts. This can help reduce risk.

5. **Consider Retirement Timeline**: If youâ€™re closer to retirement, you might want to shift towards more conservative investments in your 401(k) and IRA, while maintaining potential higher growth investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any money you may need before retirement can be placed into taxable accounts since they offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

7. **Strategize Withdrawals**: Think about tax implications when planning withdrawals in retirement. For example, consider the order from which accounts to withdraw in retirement to minimize your tax burden.

Lastly, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your personal financial situation and goals.
