(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Generally, it's beneficial to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first because they offer tax benefits that taxable accounts do not. 

You might consider these steps:
1. **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA, whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA. Depending on your income, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth.
3. **Maximize 401(k)**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your IRA, go back to your 401(k) and consider increasing your contributions.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, use any remaining funds for taxable accounts to invest in assets that you may want to access sooner, as these accounts do not have penalties for early withdrawal.

It's always a good idea to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

1. **401(k) First**: Get that employer match first! Itâ€™s like finding free money. Make sure you're contributing enough to snag every cent they offer.
   
2. **IRA Time**: Next, dive into an IRA. If youâ€™re into sweet tax-free gains, the Roth IRA is where itâ€™s at! Just remember the income limits and all that jazz.

3. **Supercharge Your 401(k)**: Once that's in place and you've stuffed your IRA to the max, throw more cash into your 401(k). Go big or go home, right? 

4. **Taxable Accounts Last**: Use those taxable accounts for investments you might need access to sooner without the nasty penalties. Just donâ€™t forget that Uncle Sam's gonna want his cut on any gains when you cash out!

Always keep an eye on your tax situation and adjust accordingly. And hey, if youâ€™re lost, consult a financial guru to help navigate your treasure map! ðŸ’°ðŸ’¸
