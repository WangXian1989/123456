The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically involves several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and retirement tax strategy.
   - A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. These can also be beneficial for stocks or investments that may generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

4. **Consider Growth vs. Income**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments with higher growth potential (like stocks) and taxable accounts for income-generating investments (like bonds) that benefit from lower capital gains rates.

5. **Evaluate Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified asset allocation across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Adjust your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocation and make adjustments based on changing financial situations, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Before making decisions, it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs.
