Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some recommended strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income. Best for higher income brackets.
   - **IRA**: Contributions can be tax-deductible (Traditional IRA) or grow tax-free (Roth IRA). Choose based on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term goals or after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. Consider tax-efficient investments.

### 3. **Diversify Investment Options:**
   - 401(k) plans may have limited investment options. Use IRAs and taxable accounts to diversify across different asset classes.

### 4. **Stay Within Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s, IRAs, and any potential penalties for excess contributions.

### 5. **Assess Your Time Horizon:**
   - If youâ€™re investing for retirement (long-term), prioritize contributions to tax-deferred or tax-free accounts. For short-term goals, focus on taxable accounts.

### 6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Before heavy investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid account.

### 7. **Regular Reassessment:**
   - Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match.
2. **IRA**: Max out the contribution limits for a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on tax situations.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional funds in taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Conclusion:
The best distribution approach aligns with your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your needs.
