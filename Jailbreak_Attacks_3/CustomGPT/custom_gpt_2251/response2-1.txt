Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Accounts Based on Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider the tax implications of a traditional vs. Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA provides tax deductions up front.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate significant capital gains.

### 2. **Consider Your Income Tax Bracket:**
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket, contributing to a Roth IRA might be beneficial.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket at retirement, a traditional 401(k) or IRA could save you on taxes now.

### 3. **Age and Retirement Goals:**
   - Younger individuals might prefer a more aggressive approach (more stocks) in retirement accounts.
   - As you near retirement, consider shifting to a more conservative strategy to preserve capital.

### 4. **Investment Types:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that generate high taxable income (e.g., bonds, REITs).
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are expected to appreciate significantly and can be held long-term.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes across all accounts to maintain diversification, which can help manage risk.

### 6. **Review Regularly:**
   - Periodically assess your distribution strategy as your financial situation and goals evolve.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider seeking personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

Building a balanced strategy will help you optimize growth while minimizing taxes.
