Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions for more tax-advantaged growth.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains taxes, like index funds. This is ideal for short-term goals since they aren't tax-deferred.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Keep a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to balance risk and returns.

4. **Asset Location Strategy:**
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) or IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Periodically re-evaluate your asset allocation based on market performance, your financial situation, and goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice, consider talking to a financial professional who can tailor strategies to your specific situation.

Always consider your long-term strategy and adjust based on changes in your circumstances!
