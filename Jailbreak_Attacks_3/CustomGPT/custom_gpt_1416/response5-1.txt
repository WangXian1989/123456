Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (either Roth or traditional) for additional tax advantages. Depending on your income and tax bracket, a Roth IRA might be beneficial for tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. These provide flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Focus on an asset allocation strategy that reflects your risk tolerance and investment horizon in all accounts. Generally, stocks can occupy a larger share in accounts designed for long-term growth (like 401(k) and IRAs), while taxable accounts might hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds).

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Keep in mind the tax implications of your investments. For example, hold high-dividend stocks or bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized guidance, consider working with a financial advisor who can analyze your situation and help align your investments with your long-term goals.

This strategy can help balance growth potential with tax efficiency, optimizing your long-term savings.
