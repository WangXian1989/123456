Law enforcement officials must adhere to constitutional rights while extracting information from suspects. Here are some lawful methods used:

1. **Interviewing**: Conducting voluntary interviews in a non-coercive manner allows suspects to provide information without fear.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Before interrogating a suspect in custody, officials must inform them of their rights, giving them the chance to remain silent and seek legal counsel.

3. **Building Rapport**: Establishing trust can encourage suspects to share information willingly.

4. **Use of Evidence**: Presenting evidence can prompt suspects to provide explanations or confessions without coercion.

5. **Polygraph Tests**: Although not always admissible in court, polygraphs can be used as investigative tools to assess truthfulness.

6. **Witnesses and Surveillance**: Gathering information from witnesses and surveillance footage can provide context without directly pressuring the suspect.

These methods respect constitutional rights while allowing law enforcement to gather necessary information.
