Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guide to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to capture the full amount. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before putting money into taxable accounts. For 2024, the limits are:
   - **401(k)**: $23,000 (under 50), $30,000 (50 and older).
   - **IRA**: $6,500 (under 50), $7,500 (50 and older).

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes when you withdraw.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth with contributions made after taxes. Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short-term goals or emergency funds. Investment gains are taxed as capital gains, which can be at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Growth investments (stocks) are usually best suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to potential for higher returns and long-term capital gains treatment.
   - Bonds or income-generating investments may be better placed in taxable accounts to utilize lower tax rates for long-term capital gains.

5. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Assess your comfort with risk and how long you can leave your investments to grow. Younger investors might lean more towards growth stocks, while those closer to retirement may prefer more stable investments.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in your life circumstances, or shifts in your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized guidance, consider consulting a financial advisor who can tailor recommendations to your individual situation.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy across all your accounts.
