To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions, potential employer match, grows tax-deferred. Ideal for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible; grows tax-deferred. Withdrawals taxed as income.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions made with after-tax dollars; grows tax-free, and withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but offer liquidity and flexibility. Capital gains taxed at lower rates if held long-term.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRAs:** Consider maxing out a Roth IRA if you qualify, benefiting from tax-free growth. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, opt for a Roth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings after maxing out retirement accounts.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **401(k) and IRAs:** Focus on long-term growth investments like stocks, as these accounts offer tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Balance investments to include some fixed-income assets to manage tax implications.

### 4. **Rebalance Annually:**
   - Adjust your asset allocation across accounts to maintain your desired risk level. Monitor tax implications and capital gains to optimize returns.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawals Strategically:**
   - In retirement, plan withdrawals to minimize tax impacts. Start with taxable accounts to delay income taxes on tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion:
By maximizing contributions in tax-advantaged accounts first, strategically allocating your investments, and regularly rebalancing, you can effectively grow your wealth while minimizing your tax burden over time.
