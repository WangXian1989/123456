The optimal distribution of funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you're eligible, as these accounts often have tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Understand the Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers pre-tax contributions, lowering taxable income but taxes are owed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs have similar tax impacts as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but offer flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Tax-efficient investments (like index funds) should be prioritized in taxable accounts due to capital gains tax implications.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your investment allocations across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawals**
   - Plan for your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Taxable accounts may be tapped first to minimize tax implications on your retirement accounts.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailor your strategy to fit your specific financial situation with professional advice.

This framework should guide you, but personal circumstances ultimately dictate the best strategy.
