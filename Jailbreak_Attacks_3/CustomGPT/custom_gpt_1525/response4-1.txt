To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA up to the maximum allowed limits.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & Traditional IRA)**: These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred, so prioritize higher-income investments here.
   - **Roth IRA**: Consider contributing to this account if you're eligible, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower annual taxes (e.g., index funds, ETFs) or for funds you may need to access before retirement.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Keep higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts to avoid potential capital gains taxes.
   - Allocate more conservative investments (like bonds or cash) to taxable accounts, as they typically produce interest income that may be taxed annually.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Assess the performance of your investments across all accounts annually to ensure your allocations align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

5. **Emergency Funds**:
   - Ensure you have adequate cash reserves outside of retirement accounts for any unexpected expenses.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It's beneficial to speak with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy based on your individual circumstances.

By strategically allocating funds across these accounts, you can optimize your tax situation and prepare for retirement effectively.
