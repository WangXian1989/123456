The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money" and gives you an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Maxing Out IRA Contributions:** If you have the ability to do so, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. IRAs often provide better investment options and lower fees than some 401(k) plans. Roth IRAs, in particular, allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing your IRA contributions, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k), especially if you have not yet reached the contribution limit. Remember that 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** If you have additional funds to invest after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider using a taxable investment account. This can provide you with more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and does not have contribution limits, but be mindful of capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Within each account type, ensure you're diversifying your investments according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, and other investment vehicles can be mixed to create a balanced portfolio.

6. **Consider Tax Implications:** Be strategic about which investments go into which accounts. For example, placing stock investments in a Roth IRA can be advantageous because any growth is tax-free. Conversely, holding bonds or other interest-generating assets in tax-deferred accounts can minimize tax exposure.

7. **Regular Review and Rebalance:** Regularly review your investment allocations and make adjustments as needed based on market conditions, changes in your life circumstances, or retirement goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Consider talking to a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and help you create a tailored investment strategy.

By implementing these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
