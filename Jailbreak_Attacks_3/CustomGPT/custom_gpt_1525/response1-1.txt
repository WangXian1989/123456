The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Consider maxing out your contributions if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible or grow tax-free. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While they don't offer the same tax advantages, they provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be useful for short-term goals.

3. **Diversification of Investments**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are well-diversified. You might choose to hold different asset types or risk levels in each account based on your financial goals and risk tolerance.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your portfolio periodically to adjust your allocations according to market performance and your changing financial situation. This can help maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a financial advisor can help you create a strategy tailored to your unique situation, especially considering tax impacts and retirement goals.

Remember that each person's financial situation is unique, so it's important to create a plan that reflects your individual needs and goals.
