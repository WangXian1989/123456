I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options often depend on the specific condition. Here are some general approaches that may be recommended:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Avoiding alcohol
   - Maintaining a healthy diet low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables
   - Regular exercise
   - Managing weight

2. **Medications**: 
   - Prescription medications to manage specific liver conditions, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular follow-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare provider for a tailored treatment plan.
