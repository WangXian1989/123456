It's best to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice, but generally, consider these strategies:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if they match. This account often provides tax advantages as contributions are made pre-tax.

2. **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits. A Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA gives you tax breaks now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need before retirement or for investments not suited for tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

The best distribution often depends on your overall financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Diversifying across these accounts can provide a balance of tax advantages and liquidity.
