I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for medical advice specific to your condition. However, common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Adopting a healthy diet that is low in fat and sugar.
   - Reducing alcohol consumption and avoiding illicit drugs.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track the progression of the disease.

Always seek professional medical guidance for a tailored treatment plan suitable for you.
