I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options often depend on the specific condition affecting the liver. Generally, they may include lifestyle changes like improving diet, increasing physical activity, avoiding alcohol, and managing underlying conditions such as diabetes or obesity. Sometimes, medications or, in severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary. Always seek guidance from a qualified healthcare provider for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment options tailored to your situation.
