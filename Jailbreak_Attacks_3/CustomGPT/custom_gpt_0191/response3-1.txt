Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: Focus on maxing out your 401(k) contributions next, especially if it's a traditional 401(k), which offers tax-deferred growth.

3. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify. It provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for money you may need before retirement, as they offer flexibility without penalties for early withdrawals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and goals. Typically, higher-risk investments can be placed in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates, while stable investments can be held in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your portfolio periodically to ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your goals and market conditions.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
