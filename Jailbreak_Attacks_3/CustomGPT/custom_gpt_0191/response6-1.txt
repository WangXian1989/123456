To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Generally pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes, but offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - Contribute enough to your **401(k)** to get any employer match (this is essentially free money).
   - Max out your IRA contributions, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 3. **Diversify Investment Strategy**
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable accounts.
   - Consider holding higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 4. **Regularly Reassess Your Allocation**
   - Reallocate based on changes in income, tax laws, or retirement goals.
   - Monitor your overall asset allocation across all accounts to maintain desired risk levels.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

By balancing contributions and considering tax implications, you can optimize your investment growth and retirement savings.
