Finding the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income. If your employer offers Roth options, post-tax contributions provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. Benefits here include flexibility and the ability to access funds without penalties.

3. **Debt Management**: Pay off high-interest debt before investing aggressively.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts:
   - Place higher-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts (due to potential high capital gains).
   - Use taxable accounts for lower-growth investments that yield qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates.

5. **Long-Term Planning**: Regularly review your allocations based on changing tax laws, investment performance, and life circumstances.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help tailor a plan to your specific needs.

By strategically allocating funds, you can optimize tax efficiency and align your investments with your long-term financial goals.
