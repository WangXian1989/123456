Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers tax deductions now.

3. **Continued Contributions to 401(k)**: After maximizing the match and contributing to an IRA, continue funding your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit if your budget allows.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement, as they provide more flexibility and liquidity without withdrawal penalties.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Evaluate your current and expected future tax bracket. Favor tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for assets that are likely to appreciate significantly over time to defer or avoid taxes on gains.

6. **Diversify Your Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure a diversified investment strategy across asset classes to manage risk and enhance potential returns.

7. **Periodic Review**: Reassess your allocation regularly based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial situation or goals.

Always consider consulting a financial planner to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
