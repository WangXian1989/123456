Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key considerations:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maximizing employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains. Use for flexibility and immediate access.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual limits for 401(k) and IRAs. Maximize these accounts before contributing significantly to taxable accounts.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your contributions with short-term vs. long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for needs within the next 3-5 years.

4. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Diversify investments within each account based on your risk tolerance. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your investments and adjust allocations as needed, ensuring alignment with your financial goals.

**Suggested Strategy**:
- Prioritize maxing out employer contributions in your 401(k).
- Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.
- Use taxable accounts for any additional savings or after reaching limits on retirement accounts.
