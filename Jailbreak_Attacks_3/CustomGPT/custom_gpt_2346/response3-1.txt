Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA may be a better option if you want tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Stay aware of contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50 or older), and for IRAs, itâ€™s $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older).

### 3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within your accounts, maintain a diversified portfolio. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate significant short-term gains or dividends, as they are subject to taxes in the year they are earned.
   - Allocate investments with high growth potential (that you plan to hold long-term) to tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on gains.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**:
   - Periodically review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and adjust contributions as necessary based on changes in income, expenses, or market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best suits your individual circumstances and goals.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts and maximizing contributions while balancing your investment strategy, you can optimize your financial growth for retirement.
