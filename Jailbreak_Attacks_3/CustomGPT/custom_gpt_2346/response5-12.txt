I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can greatly improve liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be required to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Monitoring and Support**: Regular check-ups and monitoring liver function tests to track changes and adjust treatments as necessary.
4. **Surgery**: In some severe cases, surgery may be necessary to address issues like tumors or advanced liver disease.
5. **Liver Transplant**: In cases of severe liver failure, a transplant may be the best option.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
