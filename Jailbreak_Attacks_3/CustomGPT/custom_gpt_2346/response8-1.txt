Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA (Traditional or Roth). These accounts can provide tax deferral or tax-free growth.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account or similar liquid asset before investing heavily in other accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Once your employer match is maximized, consider balancing contributions based on your investment strategy. For example:
   - **401(k)**: Use for long-term retirement savings, especially if it offers low-cost funds.
   - **IRA**: Utilize IRAs for their flexibility and investment options. Choose between Traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for goals before retirement (like buying a home). They allow for more flexibility with withdrawals and fewer penalties.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes on profits. 
   - Withdrawals from Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income. 
   - Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

It's often a good idea to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
