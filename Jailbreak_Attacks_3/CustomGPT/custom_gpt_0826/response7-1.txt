Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, based on your income situation.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - In your 401(k) and IRA, select a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time until retirement.
   - In taxable accounts, consider investments that are tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Maintain some assets in taxable accounts for short-term needs, as withdrawals from retirement accounts may incur penalties before retirement age.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your investment goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

By balancing contributions to each account type, you can optimize growth while managing tax implications.
