The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start with your 401(k). Contribute enough to get any employer match since it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider putting money into a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, go back to your 401(k) until you reach your contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable account. This is useful for flexible access to your money, though you'll want to be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure that your investments in each account align with your risk tolerance and diversification strategy.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust as needed based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your unique circumstances.
