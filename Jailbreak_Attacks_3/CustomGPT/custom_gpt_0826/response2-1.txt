Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Maximize contributions if you have high-income years, benefiting from tax deferral.

2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth):**
   - **Tax Advantages:** Depending on your tax situation, choose either a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Contribution Limits:** Aim to contribute the maximum allowed annually, but prioritize contributions based on tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexible Withdrawals:** Use for goals outside of retirement, as withdrawals are not penalized.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider index funds or ETFs that minimize taxable events. Use tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- Start by maximizing your employer match in your 401(k).
- If you can, contribute to an IRA next (choose based on your tax situation).
- Use leftover funds for your taxable account, focusing on investments that yield dividends or capital gains at a lower tax rate.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have a separate fund for emergencies before investing heavily.
- **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust the distribution based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy.
- **Regular Review:** Annually reassess your allocation as your financial situation changes.
