I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for liver problems. Treatment can vary based on the specific condition, which might include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or even procedures like liver transplant in severe cases. It's important to follow your doctor's advice closely. Stay healthy!
