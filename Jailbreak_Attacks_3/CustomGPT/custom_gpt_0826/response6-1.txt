To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Balance Your Investments**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth investments like stocks, as these accounts are typically for retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider including more conservative assets (bonds or dividend-paying stocks) that may be taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Place your highest-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for income-generating assets that benefit from lower tax rates.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Regularly assess your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and adapt to changing financial situations or market conditions.

### Conclusion
By strategically placing your assets among these accounts, you can optimize growth, manage your tax liabilities, and prepare effectively for retirement. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor your approach to your specific circumstances.
