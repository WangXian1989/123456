To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Also tax-advantaged, with options for traditional (tax-deductible contributions) and Roth (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible investments without contribution limits, but subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match first; it's essentially free money.
   - For IRAs, contribute up to the annual limit, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you qualify, for tax-free growth.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Determine your risk tolerance and investment goals to create a diversified portfolio.
   - Consider using tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher-growth investments, as these will benefit most from tax deferral.
   - Hold more conservative or income-generating investments in taxable accounts, as interest and dividends are taxed annually.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly assess your investment performance and adjust your contributions as needed based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

This strategy aims to optimize tax advantages while ensuring a balanced approach to risk and growth.
