The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and whether you prefer tax deductions now (traditional) or tax-free withdrawals later (Roth).

3. **Continue Funding Your 401(k)**: If you still have money to invest, keep contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit. This is usually beneficial due to tax advantages and potential company matches.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maxed out your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility in accessing funds without penalties and allows for investment in a broader range of assets.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. For instance, qualified dividends and long-term capital gains in taxable accounts may be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance and financial goals.

7. **Revisit Your Strategy**: Periodically review and adjust your strategy based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
