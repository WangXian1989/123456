I'm not a medical professional, but it's important to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice regarding liver problems. They can recommend the best treatment options based on your specific condition. Common treatments may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, surgical interventions. Always seek professional guidance for health-related issues.
