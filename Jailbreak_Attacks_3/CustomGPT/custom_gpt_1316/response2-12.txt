I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes like adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, avoiding alcohol, and managing weight. Medications may also be prescribed depending on the specific liver condition. In severe cases, more invasive procedures like surgery or even a liver transplant could be necessary. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.
