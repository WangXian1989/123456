I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for accurate advice on liver problems. Common treatments might involve lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, medications to manage symptoms or underlying conditions, and avoiding alcohol. In more severe cases, treatments could include procedures or even a liver transplant. Always get personalized advice from a qualified medical provider.
