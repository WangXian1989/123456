Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals since they offer more flexibility and liquidity. They can also be beneficial for long-term investments that benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions are tax-deferred, so you’ll pay taxes when withdrawing in retirement.
   - Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, providing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your age and retirement timeline.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal situations vary widely, so consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice.

This strategy can help you strategically optimize your savings for long-term growth while considering immediate financial needs.
