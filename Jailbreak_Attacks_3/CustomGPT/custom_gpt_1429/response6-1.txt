Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some strategic considerations:

### 1. Tax Implications
- **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, which means you'll pay taxes when you withdraw funds. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed yearly on dividends and capital gains, which can be higher than the deferred tax rates of retirement accounts.

### 2. Contribution Limits
- **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**: Consider maxing out your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, especially if your employer offers a match for the 401(k).
  
### 3. Investment Strategy
- **401(k)**: Generally best for aggressive growth investments due to tax deferral.
- **IRA**: Can be a mix of aggressive and conservative investments, focusing on long-term growth.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Focus here on more tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize tax burden.

### 4. Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)
- **Consider RMDs**: After age 73, you'll need to take distributions from your 401(k) and traditional IRA, which can affect your tax situation. Ensure you have adequate funds in your taxable account for flexibility.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **First**: Max out 401(k) contributions, especially if there's an employer match.
- **Second**: Contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth).
- **Third**: Use any remaining funds for a taxable account, focusing on tax-efficient investment options.

### Summary
- Prioritize tax-advantaged retirement accounts for growth.
- Balance with a taxable account for liquidity and tax strategy.
- Monitor and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
