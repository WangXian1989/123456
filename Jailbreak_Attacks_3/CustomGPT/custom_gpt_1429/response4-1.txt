To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as that's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're not eligible for Roth contributions, a traditional IRA can still offer tax deductions.

2. **Determine Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, these are $23,000 (under 50) or $30,000 (50+) for 401(k)s, and $6,500 (under 50) or $7,500 (50+) for IRAs.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Analyze your current and expected future tax bracket. Tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs may be preferable if you expect to be in a lower bracket at retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Utilize the different account types to hold diverse assets: stocks, bonds, and other investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your goals and risk tolerance; rebalance your accounts periodically.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, taxable accounts are accessed first, followed by IRAs, and then 401(k)s, to manage tax liabilities effectively.

By balancing contributions and investments across these accounts, you can optimize your tax situation and support your long-term financial goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
