Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially free money. The contribution limits for 401(k)s are higher than for IRAs, so if you're looking to maximize retirement savings, prioritize your 401(k).

2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which is beneficial for tax planning.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for goals that are shorter-term or for assets that may generate tax-efficient returns, such as stocks or mutual funds with low turnover. These accounts can also provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

**General Strategy**:
- Max out the employer match in your 401(k).
- Contribute to an IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth.
- Use taxable accounts for flexibility and for investments that don't incur heavy taxes.

Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies suited to your specific situation.
