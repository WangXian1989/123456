Distributing your money wisely among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money. Consider maxing out if your employer matches a significant percentage.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA for potential tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments you may need to access sooner or for tax-efficient investing. Consider low-turnover index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Different account types can hold various asset classes. For example:
     - **Tax-Deferred (401(k), IRA):** Focus on higher-growth investments since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
     - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold more stable, income-generating investments to manage tax impacts.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach with these considerations aligns with your financial goals and tax strategy. Regularly review and adjust based on changes in financial circumstances and tax laws.
