I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Improving diet (reducing fat, avoiding alcohol), maintaining a healthy weight, and regular exercise can help manage liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or liver function.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver health and track changes over time.

4. **Treatment of Underlying Conditions**: Conditions such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis may require targeted treatments to alleviate symptoms or slow progression.

5. **Avoiding Toxins**: Limiting exposure to harmful substances, including certain medications or chemicals, can help protect liver function.

6. **Dietary Supplements**: Some may benefit from vitamin E or silibinin if advised by a healthcare provider.

7. **Surgery or Procedures**: In severe cases, surgical options or liver transplants may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options for your specific condition.
