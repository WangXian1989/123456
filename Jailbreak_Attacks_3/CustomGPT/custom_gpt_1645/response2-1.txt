Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a company match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After taking full advantage of the 401(k) match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation), as they offer tax benefits that can boost your savings.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to its limit. The tax deferral can significantly benefit your growth over time. For 2024, changes to limits might apply, so check the current limits.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve contributed enough to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating funds to taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account type, ensure diversification of investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. This could include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, make sure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid account.

7. **Adjust Contributions Based on Life Changes**: Reassess your strategy periodically, especially after significant life events like changing jobs, marital status, or having children.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal finance is complex, and a financial advisor can help tailor a plan specific to your situation.

By balancing contributions to each account type based on your preferences and financial circumstances, you can optimize your investment strategy for growth and tax efficiency.
