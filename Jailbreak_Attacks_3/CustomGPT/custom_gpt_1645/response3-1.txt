To optimize the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Start with employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if there's a match. Contribute enough to get the full match, as it's free money.
   - Fully fund your IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. The contribution limits for 2023 are $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

2. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for high-growth investments. They can grow tax-deferred or tax-free (in the case of Roth).
   - Hold income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact. Qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Common ratios include 80% stocks to 20% bonds for aggressive growth, or more conservative allocations as you age.
   - Keep riskier, high-return investments in your 401(k) and IRA, where they can grow tax-deferred longer.

4. **Monitor and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and reallocate if necessary to maintain your desired balance. This might involve moving some assets between your accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy with retirement in mind. Consider when to pull from each account type for tax efficiency in retirement.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation with the help of a professional.

This balanced approach can help you maximize your retirement savings while managing taxes effectively.
