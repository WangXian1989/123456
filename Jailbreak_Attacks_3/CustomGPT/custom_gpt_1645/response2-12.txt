I can't provide medical advice, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional to discuss your specific liver issue. They can offer personalized treatment options based on your condition. Common treatment plans may include lifestyle changes, medications, and possibly procedures, depending on the nature and severity of the liver problem. Always prioritize professional guidance for health-related matters.
