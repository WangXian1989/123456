Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment preferences. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider maximizing your contributions, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility in accessing funds but come with capital gains tax implications.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified to manage risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it might make sense to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations between the different accounts based on performance and changing goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice that considers your specific situation, it’s often helpful to work with a financial professional.

By balancing your contributions wisely across these accounts, you can optimize your tax situation and support your retirement goals effectively.
