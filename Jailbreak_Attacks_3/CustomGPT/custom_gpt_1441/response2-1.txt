Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution Strategy**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**:
     - Prioritize maxing out a traditional IRA or Roth IRA if you qualify. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
     - 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you are currently in a higher tax bracket.

### 3. **Assess Investment Options**
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment options. Choose low-cost index funds if available.
   - **IRA**: Usually offers a wider range of investment choices. You can tailor your portfolio more specifically to your goals.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for money that you might need access to before retirement. Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, so focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxes.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess Your Allocation**
   - Your needs and goals may change. Plan to review and adjust your strategy annually or as life circumstances change (e.g., job changes, major expenses).

### 6. **Diversification**
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio remains diversified to help manage risk across all accounts.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match, then consider the contributions based on tax benefits.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable if beneficial, especially to a Roth IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings, especially for short-to-medium-term goals or emergencies.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach across all account types will optimize tax efficiency and growth potential. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
