The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially "free money."
- **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax bracket.

### 2. Assess Tax Brackets
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use this for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 3. Allocation Strategy
- **Risk Tolerance:** Younger investors might prioritize growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement might focus on income-generating investments.
- **Investment Types:** Consider placing high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts for easier access to funds later.

### Example Breakdown:
- **401(k):** 15%–20% of your income, focusing on your employer match.
- **IRA:** Up to $6,500 for individuals under 50; may vary based on income.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remainder of savings for flexibility and liquidity.

### Regular Review
- **Rebalance:** Regularly assess your investment mix and adjust based on market conditions and changes in personal circumstances.
