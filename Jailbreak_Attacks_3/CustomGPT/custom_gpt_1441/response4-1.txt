To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: After the 401(k), contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k) contributions (plus a $7,500 catch-up for those 50+) and $6,500 for IRAs (plus a $1,000 catch-up).

3. **Tax Diversification**:
   - Balance your investments between traditional (tax-deferred) accounts and Roth (tax-free) accounts. This offers flexibility in retirement and potential tax benefits.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Allocate investments based on tax efficiency:
     - Place investments that generate ordinary income (e.g., bonds) in tax-deferred accounts.
     - Hold investments with long-term capital gains potential (e.g., stocks) in taxable accounts to benefit from favorable tax rates.

5. **Regular Reviews and Adjustments**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary based on performance or changing goals.

6. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**:
   - Ensure you have adequate liquidity in your taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term financial needs before committing all funds to retirement accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If youâ€™re uncertain about the best approach based on your personal situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your needs.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your savings across different accounts while maximizing tax efficiency for your investments.
