I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver health. Treatment options often depend on the specific liver condition you're dealing with. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fat and sugar; plenty of fruits and vegetables.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Alcohol**: Avoiding alcohol if you have liver disease.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or slow progression.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis or tumors, surgical options, including liver transplant, might be considered.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.

For your specific case, please reach out to your doctor or a liver specialist to discuss the best options tailored to your condition!
