Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   
2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on them until you withdraw in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax benefits exist, especially with a Traditional IRA; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You will pay taxes on any dividends and capital gains, so these are generally advisable for funds you might need before retirement.

3. **Assess Your Investment Strategy**: 
   - Higher-risk investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a 401(k) or IRA).
   - More stable income-generating investments can go into taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Age and Time Horizon**:
   - If you’re younger and have a longer time before retirement, you might favor more aggressive growth investments in retirement accounts.
   - As you approach retirement, consider shifting to more conservative investments.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement; typically, it’s strategic to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly Roth accounts if possible.

6. **Consult With a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary greatly, and a financial advisor can tailor advice specifically for your situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to managing your investments across these accounts.
