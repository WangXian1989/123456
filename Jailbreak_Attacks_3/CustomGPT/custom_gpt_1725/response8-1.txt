The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, which offer tax benefits. For instance, if your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. Then consider maxing out your IRA contributions.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement. Keep investments that generate higher taxes (like bonds or actively managed mutual funds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while placing less tax-inefficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

3. **Balance Your Investment Strategy**: Ensure you have a well-diversified portfolio across all types of accounts. Depending on your risk tolerance, you may want different asset allocations in your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. 

4. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Life changes and market conditions can affect your investment strategy. Regularly review the performance and your investment goals, and adjust your contributions and allocations as needed.

5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: If you are unsure about the best strategy for your specific situation, consider seeking the advice of a financial planner who can provide personalized guidance based on your financial landscape.

Implementing these strategies can help you create a distribution plan that maximizes your potential for growth while managing risk and taxes effectively.
