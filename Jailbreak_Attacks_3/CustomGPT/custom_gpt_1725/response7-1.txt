I canâ€™t provide specific financial or investment advice, but I can suggest some general strategies for dividing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, so consider your current and expected future tax bracket when deciding where to save.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across these accounts. Different types of accounts may have different investment options available, so it's important to utilize them effectively.

4. **Account for Withdrawal Needs**: If you anticipate needing money before retirement, you may want to keep more funds in taxable accounts, as they offer more liquidity without penalties.

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: For tailored advice that considers your specific circumstances and goals, it may be beneficial to talk to a certified financial planner.

Remember to always consider your personal financial situation and long-term goals when making investment decisions.
