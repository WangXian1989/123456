Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Typically, you should aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Once you've maximized that, consider funding your IRA. Depending on your income, you may have a choice between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs give you tax deductions now.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're currently in a lower tax bracket, it might make sense to contribute more to a Roth IRA for long-term tax benefits. Conversely, if you're in a higher tax bracket, defer taxes by contributing to a Traditional IRA or a 401(k).

3. **Exploit Withdrawal Flexibility**: Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, which can be beneficial if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement. Keep in mind the taxes on capital gains.

4. **Maintain a Diverse Portfolio**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts. Different accounts may have different investment strategies depending on tax implications.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Your financial situation and the tax laws may change, so it is important to review your strategy regularly.

By considering these factors and perhaps consulting with a financial advisor, you can make a more informed decision about how to allocate your funds.
