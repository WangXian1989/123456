Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Retirement Accounts**: Maximize contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before investing in taxable accounts. The general contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs in 2023 (individuals over 50 can contribute more).

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred until withdrawal, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can be useful for short-term goals or as an emergency fund. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on realized gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing higher-growth assets in tax-deferred accounts (like stocks) where any growth is tax-deferred until retirement.
   - Place fixed-income assets or those that generate regular income (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax liability effectively.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate investment risk. 

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to align with your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances, consider working with a financial advisor.

Ultimately, the right distribution will depend on your individual financial situation and goals.
