The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it, as 401(k)s often have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA**:
   - Depending on your income level, focus on a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.
   - Aim to maximize your IRA contributions after you meet any employer match from your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement or for goals with a shorter time horizon.
   - Be mindful of tax efficiency; consider holding tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

**Investment Strategy**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance. Typically, you may want more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA due to their long-term nature, while keeping a more balanced approach in taxable accounts.

**Regular Review**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and adapt to any changes in your financial situation or goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best suits your specific circumstances.
