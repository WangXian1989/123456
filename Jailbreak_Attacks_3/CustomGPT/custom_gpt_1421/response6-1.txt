When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to understand the characteristics and tax implications of each account type. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money. Max out contributions if possible to lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. The choice often depends on your current income tax rate versus expected future rate.

2. **Consider Investment Strategies:**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains, such as stocks held long-term to minimize taxes. Keep interest-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts where income is taxed at a higher rate.
   - Diversify investments across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

3. **Ongoing Adjustments:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and adapt to changes in tax laws or personal financial situations.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategies based on your specific circumstances and financial goals.
