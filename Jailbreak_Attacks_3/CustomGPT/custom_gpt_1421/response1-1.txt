Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **401(k):**  
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing a maximum amount if you can afford it, as contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**  
   - If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. A Roth IRA can be especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, which can provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**  
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals, or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. 
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Overall Balance:**  
   - Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts, taking into account risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Regularly reassess your strategy based on changes in income, retirement goals, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor a specific strategy based on your individual circumstances. Always consider tax implications when distributing your investments.
