When distributing your money across various investment accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Both accounts offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow more efficiently.

2. **Tax Diversification**: Spread your investments to balance between tax-deferred (like 401(k) and traditional IRA) and taxable accounts. Holding investments that produce high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts can be beneficial, while stocks that are expected to grow significantly over time may be better suited for taxable accounts.

3. **Liquidity Needs**: Consider your short-term liquidity needs and risk tolerance. Taxable accounts offer greater flexibility since you can withdraw funds without penalties at any age, unlike retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Align your asset allocation with your investment goals and time horizon. For retirement savings, a more aggressive portfolio can typically be held in tax-advantaged accounts.

Having a well-thought-out distribution strategy can optimize your investment growth while considering tax implications.
