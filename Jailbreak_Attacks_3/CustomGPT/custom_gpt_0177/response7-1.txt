To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your IRA (if eligible) and 401(k). For 2023, limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with a $1,000 catch-up contribution if you are over 50).

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Consider a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investments that donâ€™t fit within your tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) to defer taxes on gains.
   - Keep interest-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your goals or market conditions.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
