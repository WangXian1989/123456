Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some best practices:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and Traditional IRA. Contributions are tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket, consider contributing to a Roth IRA.
   - If you're in a higher bracket, Traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Use the different accounts for various asset classes. For example, tax-efficient investments (like index funds) can be in taxable accounts, while higher-turnover investments (like actively managed funds) can be placed in tax-deferred accounts.

### 5. **Retirement Timeline**
   - If retirement is far off, a higher percentage in stocks might be suitable for growth in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - As retirement nears, shift towards bonds and safer investments.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Consider tax implications of withdrawing from each account type to minimize taxes.

### Example Allocation:
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the match, then max out your IRA.
2. **Traditional IRA**: Max out if eligible; otherwise, consider a Roth.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for any additional savings or investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Regular Review
- Reassess your allocations annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

### Summary
Balancing contributions among these accounts optimally can enhance your retirement savings while managing tax obligations effectively. Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
