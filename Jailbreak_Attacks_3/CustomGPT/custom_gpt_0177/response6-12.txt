Iâ€™m not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary Modifications**: Adopt a balanced, low-fat diet; reduce sugar and alcohol intake.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - **Endoscopy**: For varices due to liver cirrhosis.
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, where the liver is extensively damaged.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
