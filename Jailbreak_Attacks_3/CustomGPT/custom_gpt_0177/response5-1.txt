Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a breakdown of the best strategies:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits:** Take advantage of the higher contribution limits for 401(k)s compared to IRAs.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Advantages:** Use a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Consider Income Limits for Roth IRAs:** Make sure you’re eligible based on your income.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for short-term savings or investments that you may need access to before retirement.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider investing in index funds or ETFs, which tend to generate fewer taxable events.

### General Tips:
- **Diversify Investments:** Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds) in all account types.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Tailor your strategy to align with your overall financial goals and risk tolerance.

Balancing these factors can lead to a more efficient allocation of your investments across these accounts.
