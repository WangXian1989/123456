Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering a few key factors:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they are earned.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: Check annual contribution limits (e.g., $22,500 for 2023, plus catch-up contributions).
   - **IRA**: Limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50 or older).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No contribution limits, but keep in mind tax implications.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.

4. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have enough liquid savings outside these accounts for emergencies.

5. **Diversification**: 
   - Diversify investments across different asset classes within each account.

A balanced approach might involve maximizing employer matches in your 401(k), contributing to an IRA for tax advantages, and then utilizing taxable accounts for additional investments. Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific needs and goals.
