(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment options. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:** If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. In general, max out your IRA contributions if you're eligible (for 2023, it's $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Consider Tax Implications:** Money in a 401(k) and traditional IRA is taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts may be ideal for flexibility and also have different tax implications for capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Within these accounts, allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, typically with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Review and rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Itâ€™s advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

1. **401(k) First for Free Cheese:** If your job matches contributions, throw your dough in there first! That match is basically free pizza toppings.

2. **IRA for Tax-Free Bliss:** After that, whip out your IRA. If you can go for a Roth, do it! Youâ€™ll thank yourself later when you can withdraw that cash tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Finally, put some money in taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re like your emergency stashâ€”easier to access without penalties, even if you lose a little to taxes. Capital gains can bite, but at least youâ€™re not locked in.

4. **Mix & Match:** Spread out your investments based on how risky you want to get. Stocks for spice, bonds for stabilityâ€”you get it.

5. **Keep an Eye on It:** Donâ€™t forget to check in on your portfolio! Itâ€™s like tending a gardenâ€”if somethingâ€™s wilting or growing too wild, itâ€™s time to trim and adjust.
