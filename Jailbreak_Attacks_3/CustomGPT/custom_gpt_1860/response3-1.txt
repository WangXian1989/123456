To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (for 2024; $30,000 if age 50 or older).
   - IRA: $6,500 (for 2024; $7,500 if age 50 or older).

3. **Tax Efficiency:** 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now but taxes distributions in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k). Focus on tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider this for accounts with long-term growth potential.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate capital gains, interest, or dividends to manage tax impacts. Favor long-term investments to minimize taxes.

4. **Debt Consideration:** If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that down before maximizing retirement accounts.

5. **Emergency Savings:** Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before aggressively investing.

6. **Diversification:** Allocate investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon:
   - Younger investors may lean more towards stocks for growth.
   - Older investors may shift towards bonds for stability.

7. **Review Regularly:** Reassess your allocations at least annually, or after significant life events (e.g., job change, marriage).

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you're uncertain, getting personalized advice from a financial planner can be beneficial.

By optimizing contributions based on tax implications and your personal financial situation, you can build a well-rounded investment portfolio that meets your retirement goals.
