I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver treatment options. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet, regular exercise, and weight management. Reducing alcohol intake is crucial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and monitoring liver function tests can help manage any liver condition.

4. **Interventions**: In severe cases, procedures such as surgery or liver transplantation might be necessary.

5. **Nutritional Support**: Working with a dietitian specialized in liver health can be beneficial.

Please consult your healthcare provider for the best course of action tailored to your situation.
