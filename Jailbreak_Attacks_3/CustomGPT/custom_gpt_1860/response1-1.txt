Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s free money!
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **Investment Options**: Review the available investment options and fees.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Contributions**: Aim to max out your IRA contributions, which are $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+).
   - **Tax Considerations**: A traditional IRA offers tax-deduction benefits, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Flexibility**: Roth IRAs allow for more flexible withdrawals before retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **After-Tax Investments**: These can be used for short-term goals or if you expect to need access to funds before retirement.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; it’s beneficial to hold investments long-term.
   - **Dividend Stocks and ETFs**: Consider low-turnover funds to minimize tax liabilities.

### **Overall Strategy**
- **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Your age and risk tolerance will influence the allocation between these accounts; typically, younger investors might lean more toward aggressive growth, while those nearing retirement may prioritize stability and income.
- **Regular Review**: Reassess your distribution annually or as your financial situation changes.

### **Consult a Professional**
- **Financial Advisor**: It might be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that meets your specific needs and goals.

By carefully balancing contributions across these accounts, you can minimize taxes and maximize growth potential over time.
