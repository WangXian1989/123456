When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's crucial to take your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies into account. Here are some guidelines to help you allocate funds effectively:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match, then consider maxing out contributions to an IRA next.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions can be tax-deductible now or tax-free in retirement (for Roth). Choose the one that aligns with your current tax bracket and future expectations.
   
3. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the contribution limits for each account type:
   - 401(k) contribution limits (as of 2023) are $22,500 ($30,000 if you’re age 50 or older).
   - IRA contribution limits are $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re age 50 or older).

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: Once you have maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts don’t offer the same tax advantages but are more flexible in terms of withdrawals and investment options.

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Understand your tax bracket and anticipated changes in income over time. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be a better choice. Conversely, if you anticipate being in a lower bracket, a Traditional IRA could be more beneficial.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified to manage risk. This includes spreading investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and industries.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your asset allocation across all accounts regularly and adjust as needed based on performance and changing financial goals.

8. **Consider Professional Guidance**: If you’re unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your situation.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced approach to investing across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that aligns with your long-term financial objectives.
