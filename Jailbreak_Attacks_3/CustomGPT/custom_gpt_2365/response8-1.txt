When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), an IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Retirement Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to grow your retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: Once you've maximized the employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income, you may be eligible for a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any investment income (dividends, interest, and capital gains) will be taxed in the year it's earned, so it's important to hold tax-efficient investments in these accounts (like index funds or ETFs).

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred. 
   - Consider holding lower-risk, income-generating investments (like bonds) and tax-efficient investments in your taxable account since they might be more favorable for tax purposes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses) in a liquid account.

5. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**: As your financial situation or market conditions change, periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments as necessary to stay aligned with your goals.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy based on your unique financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.
