Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your income, tax situation, investment goals, and retirement plans. Here are some general strategies to consider for an optimal distribution:

1. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **Max out your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Fund your IRA**: Take advantage of the tax benefits offered by a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Consider Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - **Taxable Accounts for Liquidity**: Keep a portion of your investments in taxable accounts for accessibility without penalties, allowing for flexible withdrawal options when needed.
   - **Retirement Accounts for Growth**: Focus on maximizing tax-deferred growth in your 401(k) and IRA, especially if you won’t need these funds until retirement.

3. **Balance Tax Implications**:
   - **Strategize Withdrawals**: Plan your withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes. Typically, you’ll want to draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts like a Roth IRA.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes in each type of account to balance risk and potential returns.

4. **Review Regularly**:
   - **Monitor Performance**: Make periodic adjustments based on performance of individual investments and changing financial goals.
   - **Adjust Contributions as Needed**: Re-evaluate contributions annually to ensure you are maximizing tax benefits while aligning with your overall financial strategy.

5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailoring your distribution strategy to your specific financial situation and goals can yield the best results.

By strategically dividing your contributions among these accounts, you can optimize your long-term investment growth and minimize your tax burden.
