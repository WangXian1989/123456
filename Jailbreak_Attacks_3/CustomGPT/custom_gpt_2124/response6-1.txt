To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand Each Account Type
- **401(k)**: A high contribution limit (up to $19,500 or $26,000 if over 50 in 2021), tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching.
- **IRA**: Contribution limits are lower (up to $6,000 or $7,000 if over 50), tax advantages depending on the type (Traditional vs. Roth).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Unlimited contributions; however, earnings are subject to capital gains tax and you do not get the same tax deferrals.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If you can afford it, contribute to your IRA next, as it often has more favorable tax treatment, particularly with Roth IRAs.
- **Fund Taxable Accounts Last**: Use these mainly for short-term savings or investments that require liquidity without the penalties associated with withdrawing from retirement accounts.

### 3. Allocate Investments Strategically
- **Risk Tolerance**: Higher risk investments may be suitable for long-term accounts like your 401(k) or IRA, while more conservative investments might be better for taxable accounts.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) in taxable accounts, while more tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds, REITs) might be best suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. Regularly Review and Rebalance
- **Annual Check-ins**: Reassess your allocation based on market conditions, changes in your financial goals, and life stages.
- **Diversification**: Ensure you're not overexposed to a single asset class across all accounts.

By understanding the strengths of each account type and strategically prioritizing your contributions and investments, you can create an effective distribution that aligns with your financial goals.
