When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and current tax situation. Here's a general approach to help guide you:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Before distributing your funds, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of living expenses) in a liquid account.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a matching contribution, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially free money.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit ($22,500 for individuals under 50 in 2023, $30,000 for those 50 or older). Consider prioritizing this if your employer offers a match.

4. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 or older in 2023).

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider investing in a taxable account. This can offer flexibility and liquidity, allowing you to access funds without penalties.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your investment strategy and risk tolerance, choose an appropriate asset allocation for each type of account:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Consider holding bonds or high-yield assets here, as they can generate higher ordinary income taxed at your income tax rate when withdrawn.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Focus on assets with high growth potential, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in low-turnover, tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Monitor your portfolio and make adjustments as needed based on changes in market conditions, your financial goals, and your life circumstances.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can take your entire financial picture into consideration to create a tailored plan.

This strategy can help you build a balanced portfolio while minimizing taxes and maximizing growth potential over the long term.
