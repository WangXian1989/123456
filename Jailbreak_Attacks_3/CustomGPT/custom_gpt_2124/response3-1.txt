Distributing your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic planning based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications. Here’s a general guideline to help you:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Individual account that can be traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (after-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals). 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Regular investment accounts where you pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider IRA Contributions**: If tax deductions are beneficial, contribute to a traditional IRA. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more advantageous.

3. **Assess Investment Options**:
   - Evaluate the investment choices available in your 401(k). Often, they have limited options compared to IRAs or taxable accounts.
   - Use your IRA for investments that might be more tax-efficient or diversified.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place less tax-efficient investments (e.g., bonds, REITs that produce ordinary income) in tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) or IRA.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or stocks, which can benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

5. **Withdrawal Considerations**:
   - Plan for when you will need the funds. Money in a 401(k) or IRA typically cannot be accessed without penalties before age 59½.
   - Build an emergency fund in your taxable account, allowing access without penalties.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocation across accounts to ensure alignment with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal circumstances vary; a financial advisor can help tailor a plan specific to your situation.

By diversifying contributions and considering the tax implications associated with each account, you can build a more efficient portfolio over time. Always keep in mind your long-term financial goals and time horizon.

Here's a summarized strategy for distribution:

- **401(k)**: Fund to max employer match, then contribute up to the limit if favorable investment options are available.
- **IRA**: Prioritize contributions based on tax strategy, taking advantage of the tax benefits it offers.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for flexibility and liquidity; keep investments that are tax-efficient here.

Make sure to review and adjust your strategy as needed, particularly as laws and personal circumstances change.
