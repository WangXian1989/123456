When distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can grow tax-deferred, which can significantly enhance your long-term investment growth.

3. **Consider the Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, these limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older) and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if youâ€™re 50 or older).

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure that your investments are diversified. This can help spread risk and improve the potential for returns over time.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawals. Funds in a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income when you withdraw, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free. Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes on profits.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you have an emergency fund separate from your investment accounts, which should cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

7. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Needs**: Consider your short-term needs (which may be better served by taxable accounts) versus long-term retirement savings (401(k) or IRA), and allocate your funds accordingly.

8. **Rebalance as Necessary**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio in all accounts to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about how to allocate your funds, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your individual financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize growth and manage taxes.
