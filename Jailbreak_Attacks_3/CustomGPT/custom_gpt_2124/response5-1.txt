Investing and distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for a balanced financial strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Plans**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match—that’s essentially free money. Generally, aim to contribute up to the maximum allowed, especially if your tax rate is higher now than you expect it to be in retirement.

2. **IRA Accounts**: If you have the option, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement. If you’re eligible, contributing to a traditional IRA is also beneficial, as it can provide a tax deduction for the current tax year. Keep in mind the income limits for contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility. These accounts can provide access to funds without penalties before retirement age, and long-term capital gains tax on those investments is often lower than ordinary income tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Typically, stocks offer higher growth potential but come with more risk, while bonds provide stability.

5. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review your investment allocations and contributions, adjusting them based on changes to your income, financial goals, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice that matches your specific situation.

Keep in mind that everyone’s financial situation is unique, so it’s vital to tailor strategies based on your individual goals and circumstances.
