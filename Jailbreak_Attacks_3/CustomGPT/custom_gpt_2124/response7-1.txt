When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors, such as your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment options. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to help you allocate your funds effectively:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation. IRAs often offer a wider array of investment options compared to some 401(k) plans.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you'll pay taxes when you withdraw the money in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be a good option if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexible investments that you may want to access before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held here.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Aim for a long-term growth-oriented investment strategy, potentially with a higher allocation in stocks given the long investment horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, which generally have lower turnover and capital gains distributions.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain an emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses. This should be sufficient to cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so revisit your allocation regularly and adjust as necessary.

Ultimately, the best way to distribute your money will depend on your individual circumstances, financial goals, and risk tolerance. Consulting with a financial advisor may also provide personalized insights tailored to your situation.
