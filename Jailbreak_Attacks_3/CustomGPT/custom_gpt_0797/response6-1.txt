Distributing your money smartly among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize this account to capture the full match.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

### 2. **Taxable Investment Strategies**
   - **Capital Gains Management**: Hold investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-efficient Investments**: Use index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts to minimize taxable distributions.

### 3. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - Diversify asset classes (stocks, bonds) across all accounts while considering tax implications. For example, allocate tax-heavy assets (like bonds) to tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - Align your investments with your timelineâ€”long-term growth in retirement accounts and potentially safer assets in taxable accounts if you may need the funds sooner.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically assess asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your targeted investment strategy.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
