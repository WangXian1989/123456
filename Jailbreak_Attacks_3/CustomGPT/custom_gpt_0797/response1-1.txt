Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax benefits, which can enhance your overall returns.
   - Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Investment Options**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment choices. Focus on low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Offers a broader range of investment options. You might consider a mix of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More flexibility but less tax efficiency. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or tax-managed funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses, so you don't need to tap into retirement funds prematurely.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first may be beneficial to let your tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider talking to a financial advisor who can help tailor a plan specific to your situation.

Adjust these strategies based on your individual circumstances and long-term objectives.
