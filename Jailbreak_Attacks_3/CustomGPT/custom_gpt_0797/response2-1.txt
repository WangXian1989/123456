Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive approach:

### 1. Understand Each Account Type:
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions but limited investment options. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages for retirement savings. Traditional IRAs may have tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages but offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications:
- Max out employer matching contributions in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially free money.
- Contribute to a Traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. A Roth IRA is advisable if you believe your tax rate will be higher in the future.
- Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high tax liabilities (like frequent trading or high-yield dividends) since you can manage income realizations.

### 3. Strategy for Distributing Money:
- **Step 1**: Max out 401(k) contributions up to the employer match.
- **Step 2**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA, as this allows for tax-free growth.
- **Step 3**: (Short-term savings) Build an emergency fund or deposit into a taxable account for liquidity.
- **Step 4**: Continue to invest in your 401(k) to the contribution limit, then divert surplus savings to a taxable account.

### 4. Asset Allocation:
- Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance (e.g., stocks, bonds, ETFs).
- Consider tax-efficient funds within taxable accounts (e.g., index funds) to minimize tax liabilities.

### 5. Regularly Review and Rebalance:
- Monitor your investments and adjust your allocations as needed based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

### 6. Consult a Financial Advisor:
- For personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation, speaking with a financial advisor can provide invaluable insights.

### Sample Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your income (max out to get the employer match)
- **IRA**: Up to the annual limit (currently $6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and over)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds after maxing retirement accounts

This balanced approach can help optimize tax efficiency while securing your financial future.
