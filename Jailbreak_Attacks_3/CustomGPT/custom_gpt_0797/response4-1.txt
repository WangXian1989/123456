Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is often considered "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**:
   - If you're investing for the long-term (e.g., retirement), you might want to take more risks in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - For short-term needs, keep more liquid investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to minimize risk and maximize returns.
   - Be mindful of over-concentration in a single stock or sector.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, have a plan for which accounts to withdraw from first to minimize taxes.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your investment allocations to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your individual circumstances.

Make sure to adapt these strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals.
