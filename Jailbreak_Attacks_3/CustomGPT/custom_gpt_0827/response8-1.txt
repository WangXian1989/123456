Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Roth IRA (if eligible)**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Contribute to 401(k)**: After maxing out the employer match, continue contributing to your 401(k). This allows for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Fund Traditional IRA**: If you have additional savings, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA, which may provide tax deductions.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate more short-term gains or for additional savings once you've maximized retirement accounts.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to balance risk.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawing from these accounts. Prioritize tax-deferred accounts for long-term growth and taxable accounts for more immediate needs.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
