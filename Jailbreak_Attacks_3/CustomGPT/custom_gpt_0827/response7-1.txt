It's great that you're thinking about your investment strategy. Here's a general approach to distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your IRA and 401(k) since they offer tax benefits. If you have a traditional IRA, you might consider whether to contribute pre-tax or post-tax (Roth) based on your current vs. expected future tax brackets.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding a taxable account. This is particularly useful for short-term goals or when you've reached the contribution limits of your other accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio in each account type, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Reassessment**: Regularly reassess your allocations based on your financial goals, market conditions, and life changes.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
