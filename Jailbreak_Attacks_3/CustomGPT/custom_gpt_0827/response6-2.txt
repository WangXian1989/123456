2. **System Integration:**
   - Connect biometric systems with existing HR software for seamless data tracking.
   - Ensure the system can generate reports on attendance patterns.

### Data Management:

- **Data Collection:**
  - Collect biometric data securely, ensuring encryption to protect personal information.
  - Establish a policy for how long data will be stored and who can access it.

- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Define key performance indicators (KPIs) linked to attendance and punctuality.
  - Use facial recognition to validate attendance and correlate it with productivity metrics.

### Compliance and Privacy:

- **Legal Considerations:**
  - Review and comply with labor laws and regulations regarding biometric data use.
  - Inform employees about data collection practices and obtain necessary consent.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively monitor employee performance while balancing privacy and legal aspects.
