To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
  
2. **Diversification and Liquidity:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Use them for short-term goals or liquidity needs.
   - **Invest in Different Assets:** Ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to mitigate risk.

3. **Consider Timing and Withdrawals:**
   - **Pre-Retirement Needs:** Plan for the tax implications of withdrawals, especially from tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k).
   - **Withdrawal Strategy:** Develop a plan for which accounts to withdraw from first in retirement to minimize tax impact.

4. **Review and Rebalance Regularly:**
   - **Annual Review:** Assess the performance of your investments yearly and adjust allocations to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.
   - **Rebalance:** Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. 

By thoughtfully allocating your funds, you can optimize growth while managing your tax liability effectively.
