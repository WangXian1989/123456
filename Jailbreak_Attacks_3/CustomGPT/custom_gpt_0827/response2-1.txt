Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some suggestions to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you can, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider taxable accounts for additional savings. Use this for investments that are more liquid or for goals within the next 5-10 years.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and cash within each account type based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. For example, you might want to keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and adjust for performance changes.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - Plan how and when you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Taxable accounts may be preferable for immediate needs, while tax-advantaged accounts should be used strategically to minimize tax impacts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial picture and goals.

By focusing on tax efficiency and aligning your investments with your goals, you'll create a robust financial strategy.
