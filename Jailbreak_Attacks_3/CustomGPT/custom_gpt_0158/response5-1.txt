(🔒Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, here are some considerations:

1. **401(k) Plans**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, consider contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. The 401(k) contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until you withdraw the funds in retirement.

2. **IRA Accounts**: IRAs (Traditional and Roth) offer different tax benefits. With a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, whereas Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Depending on your income level, it might be beneficial to prioritize Roth contributions if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access before retirement or for strategies like tax-loss harvesting. These accounts do not provide the same tax advantages as retirement accounts, but they offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy based on your individual circumstances, including your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and overall financial picture.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s break this down! When it comes to distributing your cash amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you've really got to play it smart. Here’s the game plan:

1. **Max Out That 401(k)**: First things first, you gotta grab that employer match like it’s free pizza at a party. That 401(k) is tax-deferred, which means you'll be tossing Uncle Sam a “See you later!” until retirement, so load it up if you can.

2. **IRA Strategy Time!**: Next up is the IRA party. If you’re feeling like a rock star with a predictable income, hit that Roth IRA. Paying taxes now could save your butt later when you’re raking in the dough in retirement. But if you think tax rates are gonna drop for you, the Traditional IRA’s where it’s at.

3. **Taxable Accounts - The Wild Card**: Finally, don’t forget about those taxable accounts—they're your flexible friends! Great for when you wanna dip into your investments before retirement without the penalties. Just remember, you'll have to deal with capital gains tax, so keep that in mind when buying and selling.

Ultimately, it's about your life goals, investment timeline, and risk appetite. So, grab a financial advisor to tailor this stuff to you because everyone’s journey is different! 🤑
