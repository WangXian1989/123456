Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to maximize that match. This is essentially free money and a great start to your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to IRA**:  
   - After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation and retirement strategy. 
   - A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**:  
   - If you still have the capacity to save after funding your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit. 

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:  
   - Once you’ve maxed out your retirement accounts, consider using taxable accounts for investments. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices, but be mindful of capital gains taxes incurred when selling investments.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments in all accounts. Stocks, bonds, and other investments should be allocated based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxes on gains, leaving more tax-efficient investments (like bonds or index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**:  
   - Be mindful of the tax implications in each account type. Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, whereas withdrawals from Roth IRAs are tax-free.

7. **Revisit and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:  
   - If you're unsure about the best strategy for your situation, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique circumstances.

Ultimately, the best allocation combines maximizing tax-advantaged savings, preparing for retirement, and maintaining flexibility for current needs.
