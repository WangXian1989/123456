The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Here are some key strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, try to contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider contributing the maximum allowed if you can afford to do so, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA gives you potential tax deductions now, but you'll pay taxes on distributions in retirement. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

2. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in place, typically covering 3 to 6 months of living expenses. This should be kept in a high-yield savings account or a similar vehicle.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and investment time frame to determine your asset allocation (stocks vs. bonds). For long-term accounts (like a 401(k) and IRA), you might lean towards more aggressive investments (more stocks), while for short-term needs (funds in taxable accounts), you may prefer conservative investments.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Place investments that generate high taxes, such as bonds or actively managed funds, in tax-advantaged accounts. Use taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficientâ€”like index funds or long-term capital gains positions.
   - **Consider Tax Location**: Intend to keep higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth and hold lower-growth, less tax-inefficient investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Contributions and Rebalancing**:
   - Set up automatic contributions to all accounts to ensure consistent investing. Periodically reassess and rebalance your portfolio to maintain alignment with your target asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexity of tax laws and investment strategies, consider consulting a financial advisor for a tailored investment plan that suits your financial goals and circumstances.

Ultimately, your situation may require a unique strategy. Regularly review your financial plan to adapt to changes in income, expenses, tax laws, and financial goals.
