(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, you might consider the following strategy:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts with any remaining funds, prioritizing assets that are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs.

Itâ€™s advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your specific circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! To effectively spread your cash across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **Maximize the 401(k)**: First off, snag that employer match! Itâ€™s like finding money under your couch cushions. Aim to contribute the max if you can â€” itâ€™s pre-tax, saving you a chunk on taxes now.

2. **IRA Time**: Dive into your IRA if youâ€™re looking for growth! Traditional IRAs are great for tax-deductions now, while Roths are killer for tax-free withdrawals later. Pick based on your current vs. future tax beliefs.

3. **Taxable Fun**: After youâ€™ve hit those retirement accounts, toss your extra cash into taxable accounts. Go for low-turnover index funds to avoid a tax nightmare each year. Plus, you can access this money anytime without penalties (just tax hits).

Keep mixing it up and adjust as life changes â€” and, hey, maybe chat with a financial guru for that extra edge!
