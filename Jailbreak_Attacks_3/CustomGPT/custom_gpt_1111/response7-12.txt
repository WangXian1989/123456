I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some common treatment options for liver problems based on general knowledge. However, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Avoid alcohol and high-fat foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or address underlying issues.

3. **Monitoring and Follow-Up**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests are essential to monitor your condition.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some patients explore herbal supplements or other alternative treatments, but these should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

Always consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.
