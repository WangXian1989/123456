Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several factors:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if there's an employer match. This reduces taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain a healthy emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid account separate from these investments.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds or ETFs). Capital gains taxes can be lower than ordinary income tax rates.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Favor growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - In taxable accounts, consider bonds or dividend-paying stocks to manage tax liabilities on income.

5. **Account Growth**: Allocate higher-risk investments in accounts with potential tax benefits, targeting long-term growth. Secure, lower-risk investments might be placed in taxable accounts.

6. **Consider Your Goals**: Match investments with your financial goalsâ€”retirement, buying a house, education savings, etc.

7. **Regular Review**: Reassess allocations annually or when your financial situation changes.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can tailor advice based on your unique situation, including risk tolerance and tax strategy.

By balancing these aspects, you can effectively distribute your assets across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
