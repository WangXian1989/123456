To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: After securing your match, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA depending on your tax situation and eligibility.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends to take advantage of lower tax rates.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on a diverse mix of stocks and bonds within these accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains distributions.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Maintain your desired asset allocation by periodically rebalancing your accounts to align with your financial goals.

### 5. **Withdrawals Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals considering tax brackets, ensuring youâ€™re taking from the most tax-efficient accounts first.

### Conclusion
Balancing your investments across these accounts requires strategic planning based on contributions, tax implications, investment options, and your long-term financial goals. Tailor your approach to your personal circumstances for optimal growth.
