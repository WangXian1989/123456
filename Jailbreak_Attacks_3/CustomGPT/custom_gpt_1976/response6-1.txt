Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategic approaches:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Prioritize maxing out contributions if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Contribute to an IRA for further tax benefits. If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you plan to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Balance for Flexibility**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate funds here for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity. Investments in taxable accounts can also provide tax-efficient dividends and long-term capital gains.

3. **Consider Investment Strategies**:
   - Diversify your investment choices based on account typeâ€”high-growth assets can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while income-generating investments might work better in taxable accounts due to favorable capital gains tax rates.

Review your overall financial picture, potential life changes, and consult with a financial adviser to tailor a strategy that fits your individual needs.
