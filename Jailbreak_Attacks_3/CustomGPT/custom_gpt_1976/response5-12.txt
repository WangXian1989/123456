I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. If you're experiencing liver problems, the best treatment options often depend on the specific condition affecting your liver. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthier diet, limiting alcohol intake, and maintaining a regular exercise routine. Medications might also be prescribed for conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease. In some cases, more advanced treatments such as liver transplants might be considered. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
