The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation) for tax benefits.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you have additional funds, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any extra savings can go into taxable accounts, especially if you’re saving for short-term goals or need liquidity.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified and align with your overall risk tolerance and investment strategy.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation as needed based on market performance and changing goals.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
