The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Roth vs. Traditional)**: A Traditional IRA also offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These come with tax liability on capital gains and dividends. They can be beneficial for flexibility in withdrawals.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Goals**: Think about your short-term vs. long-term goals. For longer-term growth, you may prefer tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to diversify risk.

A typical strategy might be:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- Then, prioritize funding a Roth IRA (if eligible).
- Finally, direct any additional savings into your 401(k) or taxable accounts.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor a plan specifically to your situation.
