When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several strategies to consider. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maximizing your employer match, focus on maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and financial situation.
   - If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, it’s often advantageous due to tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: If you still have room in your budget, return to your 401(k) and contribute the maximum allowed. The tax-deferred growth can significantly impact your retirement savings.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement age. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Distribute your investments in accordance with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, younger individuals can afford to take more risks compared to those near retirement.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Ensure you monitor and adjust your allocations as market conditions and your financial needs change.

Remember, individual circumstances can vary greatly, so it’s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that works best for your specific situation.
