The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money. After that, consider the contribution limits and your own financial situation.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to that after maxing out any 401(k) match. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, making them a good option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income (like bonds) or for money you'll need before retirement. This can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Balance and Tax Efficiency**: Keep in mind the tax implications of each account. It's often wise to hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall investment strategy is diversified to manage risk.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and rebalance your accounts to ensure they align with your financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation. Always keep your long-term goals in mind when distributing your investments!
