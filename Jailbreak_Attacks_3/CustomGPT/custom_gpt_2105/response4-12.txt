I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment options for liver problems. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes such as diet modifications, exercise, medication, or in severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant. Always seek medical advice tailored to your specific condition.
