To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider factors like tax implications, your investment goals, age, and risk tolerance. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." The annual limit for contributions in 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if over age 50).
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contribution, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The limit in 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over age 50).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible but come with capital gains taxes. Use taxable accounts for investments you expect to hold for shorter periods.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

4. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on your financial goals and market performance.

By assessing these factors, you can create a distribution strategy that aligns with your financial objectives while optimizing tax efficiency. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
