When considering how to best distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to evaluate several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Depending on your income, you can choose between a Traditional IRA (which may offer tax deductions) and a Roth IRA (which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement). 

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 401(k) and traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement. On the other hand, Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals. Taxable accounts do not have tax advantages but offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Balance your contributions based on your current tax situation and expected future tax rates.

4. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio. A good strategy may be to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (such as your 401(k) and IRA) due to their long-term growth potential and tax implications, while keeping more conservative investments (like bonds or cash) in your taxable account.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**: Your age and comfort with risk should guide your distribution strategy. Younger investors may lean towards higher contributions in stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement may prioritize preserving capital and may shift a portion to safer investments.

6. **Plan for Withdrawal Strategy**: Factor in your future withdrawal needs. Having a solid withdrawal strategy can impact how you distribute your money among these accounts during retirement.

7. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your investment strategy based on market conditions, changes in your financial situation, or shifts in your retirement goals.

Ultimately, it’s beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and ensure you are making the best decisions for your financial future.
