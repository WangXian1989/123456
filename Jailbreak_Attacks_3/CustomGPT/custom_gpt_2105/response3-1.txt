Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment options in each account. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on them until you withdraw the money in retirement. In contrast, taxable accounts can be beneficial for investments you might want to access before retirement since you pay taxes on gains in the year they're realized.

3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, consider prioritizing paying that off before heavily investing in your retirement accounts.

4. **Balance Growth and Stability**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance. Higher-risk investments might be better in tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) where gains grow tax-deferred, while you might choose more stable investments for taxable accounts.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so regularly assess and adjust your contributions and allocations.

Investing must be tailored to individual circumstances, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
