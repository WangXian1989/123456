Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match – this is essentially "free money."
   - Max out your contributions if possible, especially if you are in your peak earning years.

2. **IRA Accounts**: 
   - Consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) after maximizing your 401(k). A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.
   - If you don’t qualify for a Roth IRA due to income limits, consider a Traditional IRA instead.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for any additional savings beyond retirement accounts. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be useful for short- to medium-term goals.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in taxable accounts. Opt for tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs which tend to have lower turnover.

4. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Before investing heavily, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses). This fund can be held in a high-yield savings account or similar low-risk vehicle.

5. **Diversification**: 
   - Regardless of the account type, maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

It's a good strategy to consult with a financial advisor to develop a personalized plan suited to your individual circumstances.
