The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It's essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA after maxing out your 401(k) contributions. Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals during retirement are tax-free, providing flexibility and tax advantages.

3. **Balance Tax Implications**: Consider the tax implications of your investments. Taxable accounts may expose you to capital gains taxes, while tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA allow for tax-deferred or tax-free growth. 

4. **Assess Your Time Horizon**: If you're saving for short-term goals, taxable accounts might be more appropriate due to their liquidity. For long-term retirement goals, prioritize your tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investment allocations (stocks, bonds, etc.) are diversified across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and timeline. 

6. **Review Regularly**: Monitor your investments and adjust your contributions as needed based on changes in your income, tax laws, and market conditions.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
