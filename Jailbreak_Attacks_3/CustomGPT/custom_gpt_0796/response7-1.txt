Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax Benefits:** Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **Investment Choices:** Check the investment options available in your 401(k) and choose diversified funds that align with your risk tolerance.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Benefits:** Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits ($6,500 or $7,500 if you're 50 or older for 2023).
   - **Choose Based on Income:** If your income allows for a Roth IRA, consider it for tax-free growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Funds can be accessed at any time without penalty, making it suitable for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Emergency Fund:** It can also be a place for your emergency fund, allowing easy access.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** Fund your 401(k) up to the employer match limit first.
- **Contribute to IRA:** Next, contribute to your IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.
- **Fill Taxable Accounts:** Finally, allocate any additional money to taxable accounts.

### Monitoring and Adjustment
- Regularly review asset allocation and rebalance as needed based on market performance and changing personal circumstances.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor these recommendations to your specific situation and goals.
