Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Focus on maxing out contributions in tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), and for an IRA, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but taxes are due upon withdrawal. Roth IRA contributions are made post-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact on capital gains.

4. **Distribute in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable events, like index funds or ETFs, which have lower turnover rates.

5. **Balance and Reassess**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your distribution based on performance, changing financial goals, and tax implications. A balanced approach can help ensure you are investing efficiently.

6. **Financial Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Consider when you’ll need the money. Funds in your 401(k) and IRA are generally meant for retirement, while taxable accounts offer more flexibility for shorter-term goals.
