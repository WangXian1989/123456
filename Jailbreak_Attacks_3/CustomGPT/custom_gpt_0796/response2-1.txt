Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to meet the employer match, if available, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider fully funding a Roth or Traditional IRA (subject to income limits). Roth IRAs can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, but distributions in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified distributions are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. This can be advantageous for short-term goals where tax rates may be lower.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Allocate different asset types (stocks, bonds, real estate) across accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. 
   - Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.

### 4. **Adjust Contributions Based on Goals**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts as these grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

### 5. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A certified financial planner can provide personalized recommendations based on your overall financial picture.

This strategy can help optimize your investments and minimize taxes over the long term.
