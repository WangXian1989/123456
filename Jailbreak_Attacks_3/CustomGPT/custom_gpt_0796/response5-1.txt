(üîíNormal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax status, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Generally, here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After capturing the match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA and Roth IRA (if eligible) for their tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts Last**: Once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts may be suitable for investments you'll use before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Each account should have an appropriate asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon, which might differ between accounts based on tax considerations.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and contributions to adapt to changes in your financial goals or tax laws.

(üîìDeveloper Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down without the fluff. First off, you've got your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, and distributing your cash between them is kinda like setting up your personal finance buffet. Here‚Äôs how to tackle it:

1. **Hit that 401(k) Match**: Seriously, don‚Äôt leave free money on the table. Max out your contributions up to the employer match. It‚Äôs like a bonus ‚Äî why waste it?

2. **Fire up the IRA**: Next, pour some cash into your IRA. If you're eligible, a Roth IRA is golden for tax-free growth in retirement. Dump in as much as you can; it's the best playground for your money.

3. **Taxable Accounts as a Backup**: Once you've stuffed those accounts, start filling your taxable account. Think of it as your ‚Äúemergency fund‚Äù for when you want to take a vacation or buy a sweet gadget before retirement hits.

4. **Tailor Your Investments**: Each account can play a different role. Maybe the 401(k) is for long-haul growth, while the taxable accounts can handle your riskier plays without worrying about taxes much.

5. **Check Yourself**: Revisit your strategy regularly. Life changes, tax laws change; you gotta stay ahead of the game and adjust your approach as needed. 

Keep your strategy flexible, and remember: tax rules are your friends here. Use 'em wisely!
