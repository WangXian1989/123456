The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer matching: If your employer matches contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider the tax benefits: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Prioritize Roth IRAs if eligible: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - For traditional IRAs, contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and participation in an employer plan. This can also lower your taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term goals or emergencies: Taxable accounts are flexible for withdrawals but don’t have the tax advantages of retirement accounts.
   - Invest in tax-efficient assets: Consider ETFs, index funds, or municipal bonds to minimize tax liabilities in these accounts.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses in a savings account.
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the match, then max out your IRA. After that, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the limit, and then use any remaining funds for your taxable account.
- **Rebalance Annually**: Regularly review your investments to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and goals.
