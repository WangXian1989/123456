Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here's a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. However, youâ€™ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar tax treatment as a 401(k) if you qualify; contributions may be tax-deductible based on your income level.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages upfront, but you pay capital gains tax on returns when selling assets. Ideal for short-term goals or if you exceed contribution limits on retirement accounts.

### 3. **Prioritize Accounts Based on Your Goals**
   - **Short-Term Goals (e.g., home purchase, travel):** Focus on taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Medium to Long-Term Goals (e.g., retirement):** Prioritize maxing out retirement accounts first (401(k) and IRAs) before contributing large amounts to taxable accounts.

### 4. **Allocate Investments Wisely**
   - Consider risk tolerance and investment time horizon. Generally:
     - **401(k) and IRAs:** May include a mix of stock, bonds, and mutual funds based on long-term growth.
     - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize tax impact.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Revisit your allocations annually or when significant life changes occur (e.g., a new job, marriage). Adjust contributions and investments as needed.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the best approach balances growth potential with tax implications and your financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique situation is often a good idea.
