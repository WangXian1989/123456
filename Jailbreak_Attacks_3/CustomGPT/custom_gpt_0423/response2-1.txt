Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: Aim to contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Contributions to a 401(k) and Traditional IRA lower your taxable income now, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts can be more flexible for withdrawals and allow for capital gains and dividends, which may be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Aggressive Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: You might choose to hold more aggressive equities in your 401(k) and IRA since these accounts grow tax-deferred. This strategy helps maximize growth potential.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable account to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund in place, separate from your investment accounts. This fund should cover 3-6 months of living expenses and should be kept in a liquid, easily accessible account.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Your allocation should evolve based on changes in income, expenses, and investment performance. Regularly review your accounts to ensure your investment strategy aligns with your financial goals.

### Example Allocation
Here’s a hypothetical allocation if you can contribute $10,000 total:
- 401(k): $4,000 (maxing out employer match)
- IRA: $4,000 (max contribution for the year)
- Taxable Account: $2,000 (to maintain liquidity for short-term needs)

### Conclusion
The best approach combines maximizing tax-advantaged accounts while considering your personal financial situation and investment goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice specific to your needs.
