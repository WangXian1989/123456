Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **Max Out Contributions:** Prioritize maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA Contributions:** After the 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement strategy. 

### 2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Typically, these accounts can hold more aggressive investments like stocks, as they are designed for long-term growth. You can take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding more tax-efficient investments here, like index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize your tax liability.

### 3. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund in cash or a high-yield savings account to avoid withdrawals from your retirement accounts.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing. 

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Periodically review your investments and contributions to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach focusing on tax-efficient investing will help you optimize growth while minimizing tax liabilities. Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
