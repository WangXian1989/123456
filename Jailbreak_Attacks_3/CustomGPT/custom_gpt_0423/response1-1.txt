The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general guideline to help you:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often has employer matching and pre-tax contributions, which can reduce your taxable income now.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These offer flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k) First:** If your employer matches contributions, contribute enough to get the full match (it’s essentially free money).
   - **IRA Next:** Depending on your income, max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After utilizing employer match and IRA limits, consider high-interest debt repayment or investments in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Retirement Accounts:** Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks) since the money will be tied up for years.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use a mix of lower-growth investments (bonds, index funds) to minimize capital gains tax.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Keep track of asset allocation across all accounts to ensure alignment with your long-term goals.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income. In contrast, withdrawals from Roth IRAs are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes based on how long you hold investments.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A personalized strategy from a financial advisor can help optimize your specific situation, accounting for risk tolerance and long-term financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Maximize contributions to get the full match.
- **Traditional/Roth IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowed.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest any additional savings, focusing on tax efficiency.

By balancing these considerations, you can create a solid plan tailored to your financial growth and retirement strategy.
