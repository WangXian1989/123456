I'm not a doctor, but for liver issues, treatments often depend on the specific condition. Common options might include:

1. **Medication**: Depending on the issue (like hepatitis or fatty liver), medications can help manage symptoms or reduce inflammation.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet (low in fats and sugars), exercising, quitting alcohol, and managing weight can significantly benefit liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function tests.

4. **Surgery**: In some cases, procedures like a liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
