Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions lower your taxable income, and growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal. Consider maxing out contributions (up to the annual limit).
   - **IRA**: A Traditional IRA offers similar tax benefits as a 401(k), while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Determine which is more advantageous based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings and investments where you want more liquidity. Consider capital gains taxes and aim for tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing to cover unexpected expenses.

5. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

### Sample Allocation (Adjust Based on Your Situation):
- 401(k): 20-30%
- IRA (Traditional/Roth): 20-30%
- Taxable Accounts: 20-40%
- Emergency Fund: 10% (if not already established)
