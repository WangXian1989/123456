To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to obtain any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contributions to tax-advantaged accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you qualify, contribute to the traditional 401(k) for pre-tax benefits or a Roth 401(k) for tax-free growth.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) contributions. The IRA provides additional tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest any additional funds in taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure diverse investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering tax implications in taxable accounts when selling.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized guidance tailored to your financial situation and goals.

This strategy allows you to maximize growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
