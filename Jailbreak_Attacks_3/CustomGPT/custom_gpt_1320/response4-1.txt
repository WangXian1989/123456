To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit if you havenâ€™t maximized the match.
   - Then consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once your tax-advantaged accounts are maximized or if you've reached contribution limit thresholds, consider investing in taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment types.

4. **Account for Your Tax Situation**: 
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Consider holding bonds and other income-generating assets in your tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on interest income in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure a diversified portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustments**: Periodically review your investment allocation and adjust as needed based on changes to your financial situation or goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
