I'm not a doctor, but here are some commonly recommended treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining an optimal weight, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, like antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular liver function tests help track the condition and adjust treatment as necessary.

4. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol can also help improve liver health.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice tailored to your specific condition.
