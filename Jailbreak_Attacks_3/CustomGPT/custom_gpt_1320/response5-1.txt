To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible (2023 limit is $22,500, plus a catch-up if over 50).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA (2023 limit is $6,500, with a catch-up option).

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest money here after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on long-term investments to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments according to risk tolerance and time horizon. 
   - Consider holding more aggressive assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Revisit Regularly**:
   - Adjust allocations as your financial situation changes, particularly with regard to contribution limits, investment performance, and tax policies.

5. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals.

This balanced approach allows for tax efficiency and maximizes growth potential across all accounts.
