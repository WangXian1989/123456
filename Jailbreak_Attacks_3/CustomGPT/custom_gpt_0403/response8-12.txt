In general, treatment options may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, surgical interventions. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Modifications**: This can include a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and regular physical activity. Avoiding alcohol and substances that can stress the liver is also crucial.
