The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k) Account**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, so it's beneficial if you're currently in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible (depending on your income) and grow tax-deferred. This is a good option if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is ideal if you believe your tax rate will be higher in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts allow for easier access to your money without penalties, making them valuable for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes. Long-term investments can mitigate this impact.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) (to the employer match) and consider contributing to either a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a robust emergency fund before significantly investing in taxable accounts.
- **Invest Outside of Retirement Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility.

### Example Distribution:
- **20% in 401(k)** (to get the employer match)
- **10% in Traditional or Roth IRA**
- **Remaining 70% in a taxable account**, invested based on your goals and risk tolerance.

Regularly reassess your allocations as your financial situation and goals evolve! It might also be wise to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
