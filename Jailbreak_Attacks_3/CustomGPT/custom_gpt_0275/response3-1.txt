Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a concise strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute up to your employer's match if available, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. If you're eligible, a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals are tax-free, which can be beneficial later.

### 3. **Allocate Remaining Funds to Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maximizing retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Revisit your allocation annually or as your financial situation changes to ensure alignment with your goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of your salary (up to the match).
- **IRA:** Max out contributions (up to $6,500 for 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any remaining funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion:
This balanced approach maximizes retirement savings while minimizing taxes. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
