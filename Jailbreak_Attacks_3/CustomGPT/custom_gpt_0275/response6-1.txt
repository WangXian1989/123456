Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires consideration of various factors. Hereâ€™s a strategic breakdown:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth), especially if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

### 2. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - Place **high-growth investments** (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth (Roth) or tax deferral (traditional).
   - Keep **fixed-income investments** (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts since they are taxed at a lower rate and you minimize tax on income.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income. Roth withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts can yield capital gains, which may be taxed at a lower rate depending on your income level.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance yearly to maintain your desired risk level.
