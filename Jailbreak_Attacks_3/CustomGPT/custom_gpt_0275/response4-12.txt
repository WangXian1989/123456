   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Limiting or abstaining from alcohol consumption.

2. **Medication**:

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine check-ups and liver function tests to monitor your condition.

4. **Therapies**:
   - For conditions like hepatitis, antiviral therapies may be available.

5. **Surgery**:
