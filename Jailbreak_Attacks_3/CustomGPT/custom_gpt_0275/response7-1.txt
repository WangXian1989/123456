To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible (for tax-free growth) or a traditional IRA for tax deductions.

### 2. **Understand the Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest here for flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: 401(k) and traditional IRAs allow your investment to grow without immediate tax impact.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Aggressive Growth**: Place higher risk investments (stocks, ETFs) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate taxation.
   - **Bonds or Income-Generating Investments**: Keep these in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates in many cases.

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Review your asset allocation annually and adjust contributions to maintain your desired balance in each account type.

### 5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - Longer time horizons can justify more aggressive growth strategies, especially in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Example Allocation
- 401(k): 15%-20% of your salary (up to match)
- IRA: Max out contributions if possible ($6,500 for under 50; $7,500 for 50+)
- Taxable Account: Remaining funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts

### Conclusion
Regularly revisit your financial goals, risk tolerance, and the evolving tax laws to optimize your investment strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
