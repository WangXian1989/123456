I can't provide medical advice, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for personalized treatment options for liver issues. Common approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Anti-inflammatory medications**: To reduce liver inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - **Blood Tests**: To monitor liver function.
   - **Imaging Studies**: To assess liver structure.

Always discuss your specific condition with a doctor for the best guidance.
