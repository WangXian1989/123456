To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Max out contributions if feasible.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - In your **401(k)** and **IRA**, focus on long-term growth with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - Use **taxable accounts** for investments that generate capital gains, as long-term capital gains are typically taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Aim to withdraw from taxable accounts before tax-advantaged accounts to allow those to continue growing.
   - Consider tax implications of withdrawals based on your income levels in retirement.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals; rebalance as needed.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Professional guidance can provide personalized strategies based on your financial situation.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your portfolio and potentially enhance your retirement savings.
