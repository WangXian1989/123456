To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Accounts by Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maximizing contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if thereâ€™s a company match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may offer tax deductions now.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings after maxing out retirement accounts, especially if you anticipate needing funds before retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Put investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Keep investments that are more tax-efficient (like growth stocks) in taxable accounts.

3. **Investment Growth Potential**:
   - Prioritize higher-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts to maximize compound growth, benefiting from tax-deferred earnings.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you intend to withdraw in retirement. Consider the tax implications of withdrawing from tax-advantaged accounts versus taxable ones, as tax rates can differ once you retire.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations according to market performance and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund separate from these accounts to avoid early withdrawals, which may incur penalties and taxes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

This approach helps balance immediate tax benefits and long-term growth potential while managing risks effectively.
