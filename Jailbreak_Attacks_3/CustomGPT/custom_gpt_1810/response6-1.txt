Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA depending on your current and expected future tax rates.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax-Deferred**: Contributions to 401(k) and Traditional IRA reduce your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Tax-Free**: Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts do not offer tax benefits but provide flexibility. They are suitable for shorter-term goals.

### 3. **Maintain a Balanced Portfolio**
   - Diversify investments across all accounts. Consider putting higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth.
   - Place more stable investments (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts, where they may be taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Reassess your allocations annually based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions.
   - Make sure your contributions align with your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.

### Summary
To summarize:
- **Prioritize 401(k)** contributions to maximize your employer match.
- After that, focus on funding your **IRA**, and finally, allocate any remaining funds to **taxable accounts**.
- Aim for a balanced portfolio customized for each account type, always considering the tax implications.

This strategy can optimize your savings and investment growth over time.
