Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Plan**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions grow tax-free.
   - **Variety of Investments**: IRAs typically offer a wider range of investment options compared to a 401(k).
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and eligibility based on your income.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties, as compared to retirement accounts.
   - **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; holding investments long-term can reduce your tax liability.
   - **Risk Management**: Consider using these accounts for investments that may generate a lot of taxable income, as they don’t receive the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.

### **General Strategies**
- **Prioritize Tax-Deferred Accounts**: If you’re focusing on long-term growth, prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA before contributing to taxable accounts.
- **Asset Allocation**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains, while holding higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Rebalance Annually**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on life changes or shifts in your financial goals.

### **Conclusion**
A balanced approach that considers tax implications, investment growth, and liquidity needs is key. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.
