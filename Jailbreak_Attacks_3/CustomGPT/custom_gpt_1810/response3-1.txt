Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly impact your long-term financial health and tax efficiency. Here are some strategies you might consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has higher contribution limits, employer matching, and tax-deferred growth. Suitable for maximizing retirement savings, especially to take advantage of any employer match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Provides tax benefits. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for savings that you may need to access before retirement, with more flexibility but fewer tax advantages.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Start with Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRAs**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA next, as it offers tax advantages.
   - **Max Out 401(k)**: Once your IRA contributions are maxed out, return to your 401(k) to maximize contributions.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on gains (e.g., index funds or ETFs).
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for higher expense ratio funds or actively managed funds, as taxes won't apply until withdrawal.

4. **Adopt an Age-Based Approach**:
   - Younger investors might lean towards more aggressive investments in taxable accounts for growth.
   - Closer to retirement? Shift to more conservative investments in taxable accounts to protect savings.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Ensure you're not overly exposed to any single investment or sector.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when you will withdraw funds in retirement, which can impact how you prioritize account contributions now.

7. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on life changes (e.g., income fluctuations, retirement plans).

### Example Distribution Plan:
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income, enough to get full match.
- **Traditional IRA**: 10% for tax-deferred benefits.
- **Roth IRA**: 5% if eligible, for tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Account**: Allocate remaining funds for flexibility.

### Final Thoughts:
Tailor your strategy based on your personal financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights and strategies.
