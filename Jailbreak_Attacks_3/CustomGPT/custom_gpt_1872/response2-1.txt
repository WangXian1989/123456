Distributing your money efficiently among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching contributions. Best for maximizing tax advantages.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Also tax-advantaged, with both Traditional (tax-deductible contributions) and Roth options (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
- **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
- **Max Out IRAs**: If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA (for tax-free withdrawals later) or a Traditional IRA (for immediate tax deduction), depending on your tax situation.
- **Contribute to 401(k)**: After maximizing the IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 3. Investment Strategy
- **401(k)**: Typically suited for long-term growth; consider diversifying across different asset classes based on risk tolerance.
- **IRA**: Similar diversification strategy; you may want to include a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, and be mindful of the tax implications of selling assets.

### 4. Tax Considerations
- Assess your current and expected future tax bracket to decide the amount to contribute to tax-deferred accounts versus taxable accounts.
- Be strategic about selling investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. Rebalance Regularly
- Periodically review your asset allocation across all account types to ensure you are aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### Conclusion
The best strategy integrates tax efficiency, investment choices, and future financial goals. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to personalize your approach based on your specific circumstances.
