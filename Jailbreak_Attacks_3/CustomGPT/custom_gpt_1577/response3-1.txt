The best way to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions; contributions are pre-tax, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Comes in two main types - traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer the most flexibility, but you pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like the 401(k) and traditional IRA) if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement. 
   - If you expect your tax rate to rise, consider prioritizing Roth accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, ensure you're diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Determine Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For example, as of 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500, and for an IRA, it is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

6. **Balance Your Allocation**: Consider setting goals for asset allocation. A common approach is to allocate:
   - 60-80% of your total retirement savings to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - 20-40% to taxable accounts, depending on your liquidity needs.

7. **Review Regularly**: Revisit your allocation annually or after major life events (like marriage, childbirth, or changes in employment) to adjust as necessary.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor who can provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation.

By understanding these key points, you can create a balanced strategy that maximizes your retirement savings while considering tax implications and your financial needs.
