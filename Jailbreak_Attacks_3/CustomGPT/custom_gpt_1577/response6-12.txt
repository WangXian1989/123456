It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional to get personalized advice and treatment for liver problems. Treatment options may vary depending on the specific liver condition, its severity, and individual health factors. 

Common treatment options may include:

1. **Medications**: Prescription medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes of liver disease (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).
   
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Modifications such as:
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet low in fat and sugar.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Eliminating alcohol consumption if related to liver issues.
   - **Exercise**: Engaging in regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function through blood tests and imaging studies.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be considered if the liver is significantly damaged.

Always talk to a healthcare provider to explore options tailored to your specific condition.
