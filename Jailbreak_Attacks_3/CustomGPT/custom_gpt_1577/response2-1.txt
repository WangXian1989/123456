The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: If you can afford to, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit. This can help reduce your taxable income, especially if you contribute to a Traditional 401(k).

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA(s), consider putting additional savings into a taxable brokerage account. This can provide flexibility and liquidity, and you have the ability to select investments based on your overall strategy.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Think about how to allocate your investments within these accounts. For tax-advantaged accounts, you might want to hold investments that generate high taxes (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and keep stocks with more potential for long-term growth in your taxable accounts.

6. **Diversification and Rebalancing**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diverse and regularly rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of personal finance, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Ultimately, it’s about balancing immediate tax benefits, long-term growth potential, and liquidity to align with your retirement goals.
