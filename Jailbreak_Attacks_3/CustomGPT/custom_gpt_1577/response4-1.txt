I'm glad you're thinking about your financial future! To help you determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I have a few questions:

1. **Current Age and Retirement Goals**: How old are you, and what age are you aiming to retire? 
2. **Risk Tolerance**: What is your comfort level with risk? Do you prefer safer investments or are you open to more aggressive strategies?
3. **Income Level**: What is your current income, and do you anticipate significant changes in the future?
4. **Employer Match**: Does your employer offer a match for your 401(k)? If so, are you currently contributing enough to maximize that match?
5. **Contribution Limits**: Are you aware of the contribution limits for each account type? Would you prefer to prioritize one over the others?
6. **Tax Considerations**: Are you more focused on tax-deferred growth or tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement?

Once I have this information, I can provide tailored guidance on how to allocate your funds!
