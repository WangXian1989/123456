(Î±) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, a strategic approach includes:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   
2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Next, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). For 2023, the IRA contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maxing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if 50+).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, if you still have funds to invest after maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to a taxable brokerage account. This can provide flexibility for short- to medium-term goals and has different tax implications.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, being mindful of each account's tax implications.

Regularly review your strategy and adjust as your financial situation changes or as you get closer to retirement.
