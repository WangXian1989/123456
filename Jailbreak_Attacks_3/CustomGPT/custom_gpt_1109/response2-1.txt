To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match. This is essentially free money.
   
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Next, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. If you're eligible, a Roth IRA can be advantageous for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Use your taxable account for investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or long-term capital gains, to minimize tax liability.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts, typically covering 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, considering a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, taking taxes into account for selling assets in taxable accounts.

Make decisions based on your financial goals, and consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
