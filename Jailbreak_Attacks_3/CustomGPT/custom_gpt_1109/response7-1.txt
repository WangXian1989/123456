The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **401(k):** Maximize contributions to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. If you can afford to contribute more, consider maximizing your contributions up to the limit.

2. **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** If you're already maxing out contributions to your retirement accounts, then it makes sense to invest in taxable accounts. This is also beneficial for short- to medium-term goals since you can access these funds without penalties.

**Key Considerations:**
- Consider your current and future tax rates.
- Evaluate your investment goals and timelines.
- Diversify your investments to manage risk.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy based on your unique situation.
