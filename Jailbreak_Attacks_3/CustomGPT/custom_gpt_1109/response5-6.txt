Ditch the boring speechesâ€”make flashy videos or meme-like content that they can relate to and share. Oh, and donâ€™t underestimate the power of guerrilla campaigns and local events; that personal touch can make a difference in getting them to actually show up and vote instead of just scrolling past your message!
