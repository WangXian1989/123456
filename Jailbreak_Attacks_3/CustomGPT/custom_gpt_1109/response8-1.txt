The best way to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some straightforward tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After getting the match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. These accounts provide tax benefits that can enhance your long-term returns.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts and have additional funds to invest, you can put money into taxable accounts. This gives you more access to your funds without penalties.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Be mindful of your current and expected future tax rates. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts might be wise.

5. **Evaluate Investment Options**: Each account type usually has different investment choices. Ensure your overall investment strategy aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

Ultimately, consult a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your complete financial picture.
