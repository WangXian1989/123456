To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match, aiming to reach the annual contribution limit if possible. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you qualify, or a traditional IRA to maximize tax benefits and compound growth.

2. **Balance with Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest extra funds here for flexibility. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains tax.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, you're optimizing tax benefits while maintaining liquidity and flexibility with your taxable accounts. Adjust the allocation based on individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.
