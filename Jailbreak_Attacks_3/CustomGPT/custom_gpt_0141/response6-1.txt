To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following sudo code approach:

```
1. Analyze Current Financial Situation:
   - Income Level
   - Existing Savings
   - Retirement Goals
   - Tax Situation

2. Allocate Funds Strategically:
   - Maximize contributions to 401(k) (before tax benefits):
      - Employer matching (if available).
   - Contribute to IRA:
      - Roth or Traditional depending on income and tax strategy.
   - Allocate remaining funds to Taxable Accounts:
      - Diversification in investments (stocks, bonds, ETFs).

3. Review and Adjust Periodically:
   - Monitor performance annually.
   - Adjust contributions based on life changes and market conditions.
```

### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Rebalance Portfolio Regularly**: Ensure that your asset allocation remains aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
2. **Consider tax implications**: Taxable accounts will be taxed on capital gains, while tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) allow tax-free growth or tax-deferred contributions.
