Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is effectively free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can.
   - **IRA:** Depending on your income level, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages.

2. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for assets that generate capital gains rather than ordinary income (e.g., index funds, stocks). Avoid holding high-yield bonds or actively managed funds here, as they can lead to higher tax bills.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - If you’re saving for retirement that’s decades away, more aggressive investments (like stocks) might be appropriate for your tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, use your taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Spread your investments across different types of assets (stocks, bonds, REITs) and sectors to balance risk.

5. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consider discussing with a financial advisor to tailor your approach to your specific situation, especially regarding investment choices and tax implications.
