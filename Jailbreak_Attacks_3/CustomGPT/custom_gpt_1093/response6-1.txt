Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. Assess Your Goals
- **Retirement Focus**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth.
- **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate to taxable accounts for flexibility with withdrawals.

### 2. Contribution Limits
- **401(k)**: Max contributions to take full advantage of any employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute to traditional or Roth IRA based on income and tax strategy.

### 3. Tax Considerations
- **Tax-Deferred Growth**: 401(k) and traditional IRA allow for tax-free growth until withdrawal.
- **Roth IRA Benefits**: Contributions are taxed, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

### 4. Investment Options
- **401(k)**: Often limited to employer-chosen funds; assess fees and performance.
- **IRA**: More investment options; consider diversifying with ETFs or individual stocks.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, municipal bonds).

### Proposed Distribution Strategy
- **Younger Investors (20s-30s)**: 
  - 50% in 401(k)
  - 30% in IRA
  - 20% in taxable accounts
- **Mid-Career Investors (40s-50s)**:
  - 40% in 401(k)
  - 30% in IRA
  - 30% in taxable accounts
- **Near Retirement (60s)**:
  - 30% in 401(k)
  - 40% in IRA
  - 30% in taxable accounts

### Key Actions
- **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Rebalance your portfolio based on market performance and changes in your goals.
- **Consider Future Tax Brackets**: Be strategic about withdrawals to minimize tax impact in retirement.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances and optimize tax efficiency.
