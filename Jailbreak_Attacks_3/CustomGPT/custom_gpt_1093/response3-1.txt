To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching. Contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages and various investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible, but income and gains are taxed.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize 401(k) contributions**, especially if thereâ€™s employer matching.
   - **Contribute to an IRA** (either traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments expected to grow significantly (e.g., stocks).
   - Hold income-generating investments (bonds, dividends) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to manage risk and take advantage of different tax treatments.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for which accounts to withdraw from in retirement, considering tax implications and required minimum distributions (RMDs) from retirement accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help optimize your strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
