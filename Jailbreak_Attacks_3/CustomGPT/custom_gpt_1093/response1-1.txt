When distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement (contributions are after-tax).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the current year.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Make sure to maximize contributions to 401(k) and IRA accounts to take advantage of employer matches and tax benefits. In 2024, the contribution limits are $23,000 for 401(k) (under age 50) and $6,500 for IRAs.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA) where growth isn't taxed until withdrawal.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable or low-turnover investments to minimize taxes on capital gains.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement, considering tax brackets and the order of withdrawals (typically tax-deferred then taxable).

5. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a mix of assets across all accounts to manage risk and ensure liquidity, especially in your taxable accounts for emergency needs.

It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
