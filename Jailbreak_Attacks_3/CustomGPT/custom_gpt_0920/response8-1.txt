Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here’s a suggested approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If you are eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs allow tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - For short-term goals, prioritize taxable accounts, as they provide flexibility with withdrawals and capital gains taxes are lower than ordinary income tax rates.
   - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Across Accounts**:
   - Spread your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, you might have a more aggressive portfolio in your 401(k) (which has a longer time frame) and a conservative allocation in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance as Needed**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to ensure alignment with your overall financial strategy.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - As you near retirement, strategize about which accounts to withdraw from first to minimize taxes and extend the longevity of your investments.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider getting personalized advice from a financial advisor to help tailor your strategy to your specific situation.

Adjustments may be needed based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
