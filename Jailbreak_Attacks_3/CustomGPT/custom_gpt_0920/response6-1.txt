Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are tax-deferred, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also allow tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxable in the year they are realized.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first—it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider fully funding your IRA (either traditional or Roth) if eligible after maximizing your 401(k) contributions.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Generally held in various mutual funds or target-date funds offering diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for more tax-efficient investments, such as long-term stock investments or municipal bonds.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-term Goals:** Prioritize contributions to retirement accounts for tax advantages.
   - **Short-term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for funds needed in the next few years, as they offer better liquidity.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your portfolio allocation based on performance, changes in income, or life situations.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** 20-30% of total investments
- **IRA:** 10-15%
- **Taxable Account:** 5-15% (or more if you have specific short-term needs)

### User Input
- What are your primary financial goals? 
- Are there any specific timelines for your investments? 
- What is your current tax situation?

These questions can help refine your strategy further.
