Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon for withdrawals. Here are some key considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k) Plans**
   - **Advantages**: Often includes employer matching contributions, tax-deferred growth, and higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
   - **Strategy**:
     - Maximize contributions to get any employer match.
     - Invest in lower-cost index funds or target-date funds if available.

### 2. **IRAs (Traditional and Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA**:
     - **Advantages**: Tax-deductible contributions (subject to income limits) and tax-deferred growth.
     - **Strategy**:
       - Use for long-term growth. Consider investing in diversified index funds or other growth-oriented options.
   - **Roth IRA**:
     - **Advantages**: Tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
     - **Strategy**:
       - Consider prioritizing contributions here if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
       - Invest in growth-oriented assets, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Taxable Investment Accounts**
   - **Advantages**: No contribution limits, and you can access your money anytime without penalties.
   - **Strategy**:
     - Use for short-term goals or investments that generate lower capital gains and dividends to minimize taxes.
     - Consider tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liability.

### **General Distribution Strategy**
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings for emergencies before investing heavily.
2. **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first.
3. **Tax Diversification**: Aim for a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) growth.
4. **Long-Term Growth in Roth IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible and consider it for your higher-growth investments.
5. **Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Hold bonds or less tax-efficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### **Example Distribution**
- 401(k): 15-20% of your income.
- IRA (Traditional or Roth): Max out annual contributions (currently $6,500; $7,500 if over 50).
- Taxable Accounts: Allocate remaining funds for short-term needs or additional long-term growth.

### **Final Tips**
- Adjust contributions based on your income and financial goals.
- Review allocations periodically and rebalance your portfolio as necessary.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

This general guideline should give you a solid foundation for distributing your savings among these account types!
