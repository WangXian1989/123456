The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some considerations to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts vs. Taxable Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions to take advantage of employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on current and future tax expectations.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for short-term goals or for investments that may generate capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. 

2. **Investment Priority**:
   - Generally, prioritize funding your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA, particularly if you have a Roth option. 
   - Once you have fully utilized tax-advantaged accounts, direct additional funds to your taxable account.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts to balance risk and return according to your investment strategy.
   - You might choose to hold more growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on potential gains, while holding more stable, income-producing assets in taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider when to withdraw from each type of account to minimize taxes on distributions.
   - Be mindful of Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from traditional retirement accounts starting at age 72.

5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**:
   - Periodically review your investment allocation and contributions across accounts to align with changes in your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized guidance, consider working with a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy based on your specific situation.

The approach to distributing funds across these accounts can significantly impact your long-term financial health, so it's crucial to develop a thoughtful strategy.
