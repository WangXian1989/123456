To provide tailored advice on distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I would need some additional information such as your age, financial goals, risk tolerance, and current investment strategy. However, here are some general principles to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are usually pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your choice here can significantly impact your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax, so consider placing investments that generate a lot of taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and return according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid savings account before aggressively investing.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

For personalized recommendations, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help develop a comprehensive strategy tailored to your individual situation.
