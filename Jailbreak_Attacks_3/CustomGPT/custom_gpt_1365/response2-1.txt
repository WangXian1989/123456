Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach you can consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money" and provides a great return on investment.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing the maximum allowed to your 401(k) if you have a high income and want to reduce your taxable income. The contributions are pre-tax, which can lead to tax savings today.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions) could be beneficial. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions if you qualify.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable investment accounts for money that you may need in the short to medium term (e.g., for emergencies, major purchases). These accounts can offer more flexibility since you can access the funds without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are well-diversified across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your investment portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Think about the tax implications of where you hold certain investments. For example, try to place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and tax-efficient investments (like indexed mutual funds) in taxable accounts.

Remember, everyone's financial situation is unique. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that aligns with your personal goals and circumstances.
