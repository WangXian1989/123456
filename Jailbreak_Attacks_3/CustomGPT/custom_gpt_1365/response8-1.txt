The optimal allocation of your assets among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize any employer match: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is free money.
   - Consider the investment options: Evaluate the funds available in your 401(k) and compare their fees, performance, and suitability for your investment strategy.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Choose between a Traditional IRA and Roth IRA: A Traditional IRA may provide a tax deduction now, while contributions to a Roth IRA grow tax-free and can be withdrawn tax-free in retirement. Consider your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement.
   - Max out contributions: If possible, strive to maximize your annual contribution limit for an IRA to enhance your retirement savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for short-term goals: If you have financial goals in the near term (e.g., buying a house or funding travel), funds in taxable accounts can be more accessible without penalties.
   - Tax-efficient investments: Consider holding tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. Avoid holding highly taxed assets like bonds in taxable accounts if possible.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - Diversify investments: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in a way that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Regularly review and rebalance: Periodically check your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

5. **Consulting a financial advisor**: Given the nuances of individual circumstances, consider working with a financial planner who can create a personalized strategy tailored to your specific needs and goals.

Make sure to reevaluate your distribution strategy as your financial situation and goals evolve over time.
