To give you the most tailored advice on how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I'll need to understand your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - Contributions are often matched by employers, which is essentially free money. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match.
   - Check the investment options available in your plan.
   - Consider your tax bracket now and in retirement, as withdrawals will be taxed.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, helping you lower your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - The contribution limits are lower compared to a 401(k), so itâ€™s often advisable to max out your 401(k) first if your employer matches.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - These accounts do not have tax advantages but offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when you sell investments for a profit.
   - This could be a good place for investments that you may want to access before retirement or for savings you may need in the short term.

**General Tips for Distribution**:
- Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to secure any employer match.
- Consider maxing out your Roth IRA for tax-free growth if eligible.
- Use taxable accounts for investment strategies that can minimize taxes, like holding investments long enough to qualify for long-term capital gains rates.
