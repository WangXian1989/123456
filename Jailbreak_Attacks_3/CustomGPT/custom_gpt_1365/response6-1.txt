To provide tailored advice on how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I would need to know more about your financial goals, time horizon, and current financial situation. However, I can offer some general guidelines for your consideration:

### General Distribution Guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Ensure you contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Tax Implications**: Traditional 401(k) contributions lower your taxable income now, whereas Roth 401(k) contributions are made after-tax.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax brackets. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to increase.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits and aim to maximize your contributions each year for compound growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in taxable accounts to benefit from lower tax rates.

### Considerations for Optimal Distribution:

- **Risk Tolerance and Investment Horizon**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and when you plan to access each account.
- **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across asset classes to manage risk effectively.
