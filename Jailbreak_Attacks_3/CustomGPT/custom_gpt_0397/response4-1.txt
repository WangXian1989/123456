Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After the match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront.

3. **Continue with the 401(k):** Once you've maxed out your IRA contribution (if eligible), continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. This is useful for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, stocks are better suited for accounts meant for long-term growth, while bonds may be suitable for more immediate needs.

6. **Tax Efficiency:** Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient ones (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

7. **Review Regularly:** Assessment and adjustments based on changing circumstances and market conditions are crucial.
