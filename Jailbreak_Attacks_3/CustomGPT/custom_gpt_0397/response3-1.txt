Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing out employer match if available.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals. Choose based on current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, but offer flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Investment Goals:**
   - Determine your short-term versus long-term goals. Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth and riskier investments, while keeping more liquid, safer investments in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Keep tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient assets (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burden.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement. Balance withdrawals to minimize taxes over time.

### Example Strategy:
1. **Max out 401(k) contributions up to the employer match.**
2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth (if eligible).**
3. **Use taxable accounts for additional investing and short-term needs.**

### 5. **Regular Review:**
   - Periodically reassess your strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.
