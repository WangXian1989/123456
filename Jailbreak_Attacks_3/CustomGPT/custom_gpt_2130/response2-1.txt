Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - After that, consider contributing to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation) to take advantage of tax benefits.

2. **Diversification**: 
   - Within your accounts, consider diversifying your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.

3. **Tax Strategies**: 
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher growth investments that may generate significant capital gains or interest (since taxes on gains are deferred until withdrawal).
   - Keep more conservative investments or those generating regular income (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts, as they can provide cash flow without hitting your tax-advantaged limits.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Consider your expected tax bracket in retirement. You may want to withdraw funds from taxable accounts first to allow the tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing tax-deferred as long as possible.
   - RMDs (Required Minimum Distributions) start at age 72 for traditional IRAs and 401(k)s, so plan accordingly.

5. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk profile.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - It may be helpful to consult a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Ultimately, the best way to distribute your money will depend on your individual circumstances, so it's important to create a comprehensive financial plan.
