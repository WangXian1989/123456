Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline for effective allocation:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** 
   - First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - If you’re eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA is especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Fund 401(k) to Max Limit:**
   - If you have room in your budget after funding your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual maximum.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals:**
   - Use taxable accounts to hold investments for shorter-term goals or to maintain liquidity. These can be beneficial for investments that generate capital gains, as long-term gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability. Consider placing bonds or actively managed funds in tax-advantaged accounts, as these can generate higher taxable income.

6. **Assess Your Risk Tolerance:**
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts. 

7. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Annually assess and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation based on your changing goals and risk tolerance.

It’s wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
