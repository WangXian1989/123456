To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**: 401(k) and IRA contributions often provide tax advantages. Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement but require after-tax contributions.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After taking full advantage of any employer match, contribute to your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation) to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for investments that you might want to access before retirement. These accounts are also beneficial for holding investments that have favorable long-term capital gains tax treatment.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your portfolio across all accounts is diversified to reduce risk, considering a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your financial goals, especially as you approach retirement.

7. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Consider how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free. This can affect your strategy for which account to draw from during retirement.

It's recommended to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your unique financial situation and goals.
