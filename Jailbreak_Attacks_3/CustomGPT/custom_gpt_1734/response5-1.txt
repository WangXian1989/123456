(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, you might want to prioritize these accounts based on their tax advantages. For example, max out your employer match in your 401(k) first, then consider contributing to an IRA, especially if it offers tax-deductible contributions. Once youâ€™ve maximized those tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate additional funds to your taxable accounts.

Consider your investment strategy as well. Tax-advantaged accounts are typically best for investments that are expected to grow significantly over time, while taxable accounts might be suitable for investments that generate regular income (such as bonds) or short-term goals. Itâ€™s advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your individual situation.

First off, if your workplace offers a 401(k) matching contribution, grab that free money like it's a hot slice of pizza! Seriously, max that out first so you're not leaving cash on the table. 

Next step? Dive into an IRA. Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA if you think your tax rate is lower now than itâ€™ll be laterâ€”because who doesn't want their gains tax-free when they retire, am I right? After you've drained your tax-advantaged accounts dry, then it's time to invest in your taxable accounts. This is where you can play a bit more freelyâ€”just be smart about taxes so you donâ€™t get walloped by capital gains. And hey, life's too short for complexity, so it might be worth chatting with a pro to optimize your strategy!
