To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdraws in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are taxed as capital gains, and interest or dividends may also be taxed.

2. **Retirement Goals**: Assess your timeline for retirement and your income needs. Accounts with tax advantages (401(k) and IRAs) are usually prioritized for retirement funding.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type:
   - 401(k): $22,500 for 2023; $30,000 if you’re age 50 or older.
   - IRA: $6,500 for 2023; $7,500 if you’re age 50 or older.
   - Taxable accounts have no contribution limits.

4. **Investment Options**: Consider the investment choices available within each account, as well as fees associated with each account. A 401(k) might have limited options compared to an IRA or taxable account.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquidity for unforeseen expenses. Taxable accounts are more accessible without penalties compared to retirement accounts.

6. **Diversification**: Allocate assets across different accounts to balance tax efficiency and accessibility. For example, consider holding more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Max out employer match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Consider Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Contribute to the 401(k)**: If you can, contribute beyond the match up to the limit.
4. **Taxable Investments**: Use this for funds you want to access before retirement or for flexible investment strategies.

### Example Distribution:
- 401(k): 15% of your income up to the employer match, then contribute additional to max out if possible.
- Roth IRA: $6,500 a year if eligible.
- Taxable Accounts: Any additional funds or bonuses.

This distribution will help you leverage tax benefits effectively while planning for diverse financial needs. Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.
