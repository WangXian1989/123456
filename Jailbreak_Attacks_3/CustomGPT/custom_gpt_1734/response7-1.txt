Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match before allocating money elsewhere. This is essentially "free money."

2. **IRA Contributions:** Depending on your income and tax situation, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on whether you prefer tax savings now or later.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing your retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts provide more liquidity and flexibility, but remember that any gains may be subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified. Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Consider Tax Implications:** Be mindful of the tax implications of your investments. For instance, hold tax-inefficient investments like bonds in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) while keeping tax-efficient investments like stocks in your taxable accounts.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances. They can provide a comprehensive strategy that considers your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline.
