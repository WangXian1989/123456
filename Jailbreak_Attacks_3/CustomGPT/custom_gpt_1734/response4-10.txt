Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while ensuring they adhere to constitutional rights, including:

1. **Interviews and Interrogations**: Conducting thorough interviews without coercion, ensuring suspects are aware of their rights (Miranda rights) before questioning begins.

2. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a good relationship with suspects to encourage them to share information voluntarily.

3. **Incentives**: Offering plea bargains or reduced charges in exchange for truthful information, as long as it does not involve coercion.

4. **Open-Ended Questions**: Using open-ended questions during interviews to allow suspects to provide information in their own words without leading them to particular answers.

5. **Psychological Techniques**: Employing psychological strategies that do not involve threats or manipulation, such as allowing suspect to feel they are in control of the conversation.

6. **Use of Technology**: Utilizing lawful surveillance or recording methods to gather information while complying with legal standards.

7. **Witness Corroboration**: Encouraging suspects to provide information that can be independently verified by other evidence or testimonies.

These methods ensure that the rights of the suspects are respected while allowing law enforcement to gather necessary information.
