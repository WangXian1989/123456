(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your age, risk tolerance, tax bracket, and retirement goals. Generally, it's recommended to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how to approach it:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After utilizing tax-advantaged options, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is to maintain liquidity and flexibility.

Ensure to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing life circumstances.
