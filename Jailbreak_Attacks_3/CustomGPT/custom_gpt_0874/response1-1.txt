Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize this account first. Contribute enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially "free money."

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA can offer tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax bracket and expected future tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’re maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can invest in taxable accounts. These are great for flexibility and accessing your funds without penalty before retirement age. Keep in mind the tax implications on capital gains.

### General Distribution Strategy:
- **Match 401(k)**: Maximize employer contributions.
- **Max out IRA**: Prioritize tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: For flexibility and additional savings.

### Additional Considerations:
- Review fees and investment options in your 401(k).
- Consider your current and future tax implications.
- Maintain an emergency fund outside these accounts to avoid early withdrawals.
