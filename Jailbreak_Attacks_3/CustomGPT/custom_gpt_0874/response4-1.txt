Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you can, maximize your contributions to your 401(k). The contributions are pre-tax, which means they lower your taxable income for the year. 
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income, you may be eligible for a tax-deductible IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing the above options, you can invest in taxable accounts. It's important to be aware of the tax implications for capital gains, dividends, and interest earned in these accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified. This helps in managing risk.

5. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Think about your tax situation in retirement. Withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains and qualified dividends from taxable accounts may be taxed at a lower rate.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Keep an emergency fund in a highly liquid account to avoid withdrawal penalties from retirement accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan that best suits your individual circumstances.
