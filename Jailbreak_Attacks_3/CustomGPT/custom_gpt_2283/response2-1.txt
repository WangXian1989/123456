Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing up to the maximum limit if you can afford it, as this lowers your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**:
   - If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, especially if you are in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
   - A Traditional IRA can be a good option if you need an immediate tax deduction. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for investments intended for shorter-term needs or for tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or qualified dividends that are taxed at lower rates.
   - Keep an eye on capital gains taxes when selling investments; consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Regardless of account type, ensure a diversified portfolio that matches your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Overall Strategy**:
   - Balance your contributions: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that down. If you are saving for a specific goal (like a house), keep that in mind as well.
   - Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.

A common approach is to maximize employer contributions in your 401(k), then fund an IRA, and finally use taxable accounts for additional investments.
