The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of each account type. Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA are typically made pre-tax (lowering your taxable income), while Roth IRA contributions are made after-tax, potentially growing tax-free.

3. **Diversify Investment Options**: Use your 401(k) to invest in options provided by your employer, then consider your IRA for a broader range of investments. Taxable accounts can be used for investments that generate capital gains, which may be taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**: Ensure you have an emergency fund established in a savings account or low-risk investments. For short-term financial goals, consider keeping funds in taxable accounts for easier access.

5. **Long-Term Growth**: Focus your long-term investments in tax-advantaged accounts for growth. A mix of stocks and bonds can be beneficial, but tailored to your risk tolerance.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to remain aligned with your financial goals, as life circumstances and market conditions change.

It's always a good idea to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
