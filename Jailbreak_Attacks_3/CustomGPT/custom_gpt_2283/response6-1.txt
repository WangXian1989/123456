To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to meet any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, aim for the maximum annual contribution.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. This allows for tax-free growth or tax-deferred growth.

2. **Strategic Asset Allocation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that generate capital gains rather than ordinary income (like qualified dividends) to minimize tax implications. 
   - Consider holding high-income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like bonds) and growth investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts for better long-term tax efficiency.

3. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

By following these steps, you'll create a well-structured investment strategy that leverages the benefits of each account type while minimizing tax implications. If further nuances are needed, please specify!
