I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for any liver issues. Treatment options for liver problems often depend on the specific condition and severity, but here are some general approaches that might be considered:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Dietary Modifications:** Adopting a balanced diet with reduced alcohol intake, avoiding processed foods, and increasing fruits and vegetables may help improve liver health.
   - **Regular Exercise:** Maintaining a healthy weight and being physically active can support liver function.

2. **Medications:** Depending on the liver condition, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antivirals for hepatitis or medications to reduce inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring:** Keeping up with routine check-ups and liver function tests is crucial to track the progress of the condition.

Always seek the guidance of a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
