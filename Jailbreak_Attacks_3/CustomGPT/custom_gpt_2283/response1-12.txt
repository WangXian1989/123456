I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. Treatment options can vary depending on the specific condition and its severity. Generally, options might include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications to manage symptoms or underlying issues, and in some cases, more advanced treatments like surgery or liver transplant. Always seek personalized advice from a medical expert for the best course of action.
