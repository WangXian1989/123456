I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options that people with liver problems might consider. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Here are some treatment options that may be recommended:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can support liver health. Reducing alcohol intake and avoiding substances that may harm the liver are also crucial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating related health issues, such as diabetes or high cholesterol, can help alleviate stress on the liver.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and assess the effectiveness of any treatment plan.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical interventions such as a liver transplant may be necessary.

6. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore alternative therapies like herbal supplements or acupuncture, but it is crucial to discuss these with a doctor, as they may not be safe or effective for everyone.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment tailored to your needs.
