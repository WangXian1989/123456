The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. For a 401(k) and IRAs, contributions can reduce your taxable income. In 2023, the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50), and the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. This can be useful for short-term savings goals or if you've already maxed out tax-advantaged contributions.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts where growth won't be taxed until withdrawal.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio and adjust as needed based on performance, changes in income, or shifts in your financial goals.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your current financial situation.

Always consider your long-term goals, risk tolerance, and the tax implications of your investment choices.
