Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Beyond that, consider maxing out your contributions if you can, as traditional 401(k) contributions lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your income and tax situation, maxing out an IRA can be beneficial. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions. Choose based on your expected tax rate during retirement versus now.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments that may not align well with traditional retirement accounts, such as those you may need to access before retirement age. Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies, as capital gains and dividends will be taxed.

4. **Consider a Balanced Approach:** A common approach is to allocate funds proportionally across accounts, taking into account tax implications and your time horizon. You may want to invest more aggressively in accounts with tax advantages if youâ€™re in a lower tax bracket.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Keep an eye on your asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personal circumstances can vary widely, so consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that works best for you.

It's crucial to regularly review and adjust your strategy based on changes in your financial situation and goals.
