Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment growth and tax efficiency. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**  
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. It's essentially free money.

### 2. **Use Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**  
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions here for tax deferment. 
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions in an IRA, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**  
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and easier access to your funds if needed.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**  
   - **401(k)**: Consider investing in a mix of low-cost index funds or target-date funds based on your retirement timeline.
   - **IRA**: Similar investment strategies as the 401(k), but you might opt for investments not available in your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Rebalancing**  
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy**  
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, take from taxable accounts first, then from tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy based on your individual goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation.
