Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors. Here are the best strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matching contributions and has higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA**: Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax) options allow for tax-advantaged growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes but provide more flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (this is essentially free money).
   - After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term investments to defer taxes.
   - Place investments with higher turnover or dividends in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

4. **Investment Allocation**:
   - For aggressive growth, consider stocks in your 401(k) and IRA, where they can appreciate tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Use bonds or income-generating investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your allocations annually or after significant life changes (like a salary increase or major purchase).

6. **Seek Professional Guidance**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution across your accounts to align with your financial goals and tax situation.
