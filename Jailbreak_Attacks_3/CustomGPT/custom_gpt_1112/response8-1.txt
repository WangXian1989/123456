To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. This helps optimize tax savings and growth potential.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50), and for IRAs, itâ€™s $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50).

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short-term goals and more flexibility but subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) since they can compound without immediate taxation.
   - Consider holding more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired risk level and asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By following this approach, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
