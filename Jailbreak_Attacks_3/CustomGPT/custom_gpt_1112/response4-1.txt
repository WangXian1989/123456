To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your contributions to an IRA, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals, benefiting you if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don't provide tax advantages but allow for greater flexibility and access. Consider holding investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds) to minimize tax impacts.

3. **Investment Allocation**:
   - Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. Consider the overall asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) rather than segregating investments by account type.
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes, usually beginning with taxable accounts to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

5. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation, adjusting for market changes.

This approach ensures you leverage tax benefits while aiming for growth and maintaining liquidity for short-term needs. Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
