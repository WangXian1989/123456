I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver treatment options. The best option depends on your specific liver condition, but common treatments might include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, antiviral medications for hepatitis or medications to manage symptoms of liver disease.
  
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Surgery**: In some cases, procedures like liver transplantation or surgery to remove tumors might be necessary.

4. **Routine Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and monitoring liver function tests are crucial.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for tailored advice based on your situation.
