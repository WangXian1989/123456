When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your age, retirement goals, tax bracket, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: Consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions if you have a high income and want to lower your taxable income. These contributions lower your current tax liability and grow tax-deferred until retirement.

3. **IRA Accounts**: Depending on your eligibility, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals—invaluable during retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out your contributions in tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility with withdrawals; however, you'll need to be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider diversifying your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, higher-risk investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts for maximum growth, while more conservative investments can be in taxable accounts.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize your tax burden.

Regularly review and adjust your contributions as your financial situation and market conditions change.
