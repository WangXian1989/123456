Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your age, income, retirement goals, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute as much as you can to take advantage of pre-tax contributions if you're in a higher tax bracket. Consider using Roth options if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). The tax benefits make this a good option for long-term growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds you might need access to before retirement or for investments that may generate capital gains. Since you pay taxes on earnings annually, think about holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).
   - **Asset Location:** Generally, keep investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable accounts. 

4. **Diversification:** Make sure to diversify your investments across all accounts, not just within individual accounts. This can help manage risk and improve returns over time.

5. **Reassess Periodically:** As your financial situation, goals, and tax laws change, regularly reassess your contributions and allocations to ensure they are still aligned with your overall strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If youâ€™re unsure about your strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

Remember, the best allocation will differ from person to person, so it's important to evaluate your unique circumstances.
