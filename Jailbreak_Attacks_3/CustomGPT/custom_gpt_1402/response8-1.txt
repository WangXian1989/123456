When distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to maximize your investments and minimize taxes:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to maximize that match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts, as these accounts grow tax-deferred (or even tax-free in the case of a Roth IRA).

3. **401(k) Contributions:** If you have access to a 401(k) plan, consider maximizing your contributions up to the annual limit. If your employer offers Roth contributions, you can consider this option as well for tax diversification.

4. **IRA Contributions:** Contribute to an IRA next. You have the choice between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement), depending on your income and tax situation.

5. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, and consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

6. **Asset Location:** Be strategic about where you hold certain types of investments. Place high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

7. **Periodically Review:** Reassess your allocation regularly based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals to ensure your strategy aligns with your objectives.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and retirement goals.
