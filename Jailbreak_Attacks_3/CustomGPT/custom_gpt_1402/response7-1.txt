It's great that you're considering how to effectively distribute your money across different types of accounts. Hereâ€™s a general approach to help you with this decision:

1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** If you have a 401(k) with employer matching, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.
   - **High-Interest Debt:** If you have any high-interest debt, consider paying that down before investing.

2. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - Contribute up to the limit to take advantage of potential tax benefits, especially if your employer provides a match.
   - Consider investment options within the 401(k) to ensure you have a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance.

3. **IRA Contributions:**
   - After maxing out any employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them a good choice if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - If you are eligible, contribute to both traditional and Roth IRAs up to the allowable limits.

4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement age, as they offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Investment Allocation:**
   - Within each account type, determine your investment strategy based on your time horizon and risk tolerance. Younger investors might lean more towards equities, while those closer to retirement might prefer a more conservative mix.

6. **Review and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly review your investment allocations and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your individual circumstances.
