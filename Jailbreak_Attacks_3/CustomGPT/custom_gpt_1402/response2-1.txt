Determining the best way to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax considerations, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here’s a general framework to help you make a decision:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your eligibility and tax situation:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-deferred. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free (if certain conditions are met).

### 3. **Fill Up 401(k) Contribution Limits**:
   - After maximizing the employer match and contributing to an IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit ($19,500 for 2021 and $20,500 for 2022, plus an additional $6,500 catch-up contribution if you're over 50).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Growth and Flexibility**:
   - Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider investing in taxable accounts for additional growth. This may provide more liquidity and flexibility, and you can withdraw funds without penalties. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held in these accounts.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Regardless of the account type, maintain a balanced asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This may include stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

### 6. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Assess your current and projected future tax brackets. Generally:
     - **High earners**: Might benefit from tax-deferred accounts to lower taxable income now.
     - **Lower earners**: May prefer Roth accounts for tax-free growth since they could be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

### 7. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your contributions and investment mix as your financial situation, retirement goals, and tax laws change.

### Conclusion:
A potentially effective strategy is to start with contributions that secure any employer match, followed by funding an IRA, then maximize the 401(k), and finally invest in taxable accounts. Always consider seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor to tailor the approach to your specific circumstances.
