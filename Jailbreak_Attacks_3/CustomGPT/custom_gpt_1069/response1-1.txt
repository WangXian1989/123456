Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you strategize:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (if eligible) or a traditional IRA since these accounts offer tax benefits. If you expect your tax rate to be higher upon retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Focus on 401(k) Contributions:** Once you’ve maxed out your IRA contributions, consider contributing more to your 401(k). For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments once you’ve maxed out your retirement accounts. This gives you greater access to your money if you need it before retirement age, though be aware of capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Investment Options:** Ensure you're choosing investments that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon in all accounts. Diversification is key.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance:** Regularly assess your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed based on performance, life changes, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

By following these steps, you can develop a balanced distribution strategy that helps you meet your retirement goals effectively.
