Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs also offer potential tax deductions but tax you on withdrawals. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold. They offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals and accessing funds without penalties.

3. **Investment Goals**: Define your short-term vs. long-term goals. Funds in a taxable account may be more accessible for short-term needs or emergencies, while retirement accounts are better suited for long-term growth.

4. **Risk Tolerance**: Consider your comfort level with market volatility. Typically, retirement accounts can be more aggressive since you have time to ride out fluctuations.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits to each account type and plan your contributions accordingly.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment portfolio is well-diversified across asset classes irrespective of the account type.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement, as this can affect your strategy.

As a general rule, a balanced approach often involves prioritizing contributions to get full employer matches in your 401(k), then maxing out your IRA contributions, and finally investing in taxable accounts as needed based on your cash flow requirements. Consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your individual circumstances can also provide valuable insights.
