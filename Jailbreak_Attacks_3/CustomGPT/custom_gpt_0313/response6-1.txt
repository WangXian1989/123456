Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax; consider tax-efficient funds.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is free money.
   - **IRA or Roth IRA**: Fund these accounts next, especially if you’re eligible for a Roth, due to tax-free growth.

### 3. **Allocate Investments Wisely**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a diversified mix of growth-oriented investments (stocks, index funds).
   - **IRA**: Consider a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use tax-efficient investments (like ETFs) and focus on long-term growth to minimize tax implications.

### 4. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Evaluate your allocations annually, adjusting based on market conditions, performance, and changes in personal circumstances.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **Age 30**:
  - **401(k)**: 30%
  - **Traditional IRA**: 20%
  - **Roth IRA**: 20%
  - **Taxable Accounts**: 30%

- **Age 50**:
  - **401(k)**: 40%
  - **Traditional IRA**: 30%
  - **Roth IRA**: 10%
  - **Taxable Accounts**: 20%

### Considerations
- **Time Horizon**: Longer horizons allow for more equity exposure.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust allocations based on your comfort level with market volatility.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions among these accounts can optimize tax efficiency and growth potential. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific circumstances.
