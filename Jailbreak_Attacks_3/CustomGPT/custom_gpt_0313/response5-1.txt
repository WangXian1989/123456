To optimize your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Focus on maxing out contributions, especially if your employer matches.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - Align investments with your goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.) and timelines. Long-term investments can tolerate more risk.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a diverse portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### 4. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing goals.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** Prioritize max contributions, invest in higher-risk assets (like stocks) for growth.
- **IRA:** Depending on your tax strategy, consider a mix of stocks and bonds or focus on Roth for tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for short-term goals and invest in low-turnover, tax-efficient funds.

### Conclusion
Consult a financial advisor to tailor a specific strategy that fits your unique situation. Prioritizing tax efficiency and aligning investments with your financial goals will maximize your returns over time.
