I’m not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver issues. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for specific advice tailored to your condition. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Follow a balanced diet low in fats and sugars. Incorporate fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications may be prescribed.
   - **Liver Supplements**: Some might benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but consult your doctor first.

3. **Avoid Alcohol and Toxins**: Steer clear of alcohol and any substances that can further damage the liver.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups to monitor liver function through blood tests are crucial.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always follow your doctor’s advice for the best outcome.
