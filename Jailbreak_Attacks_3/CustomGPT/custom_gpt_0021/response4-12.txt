I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options. Common treatments for liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet alteration, weight loss, and exercise.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed.
3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Important for most liver conditions.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up appointments to track liver health.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be necessary.

Always seek personalized advice from a healthcare provider.
