To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of it, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out your contribution to benefit from tax deferrals and any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, you can use taxable accounts for more flexible access to funds without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: 
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize contributions to Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) now.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, a traditional IRA or 401(k) may be more beneficial.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments across accounts are well-diversified to balance risk.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**: Periodically review your allocations based on your financial goals, market conditions, and any changes in your circumstances.
