Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: If possible, max out contributions to your IRA (Roth or Traditional) and then increase your 401(k) contributions. This helps in taking advantage of tax-deferred growth.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts** (401(k) and IRA): Focus on investments with higher growth potential (like stocks) since gains are tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Use this for investments that generate lower tax liabilities, such as index funds or tax-managed funds.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes to minimize risk.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**: Think about your expected retirement income needs. Accounts with tax advantages are typically for long-term growth, while taxable accounts can provide liquidity for immediate needs.

6. **Annual Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.
