The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great start to your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation. IRAs offer tax advantages that can be beneficial for long-term savings. 

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If you still have funds to invest after contributing to the IRA, increase your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit. This account grows tax-deferred, which can significantly benefit your retirement savings.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have reached the limits for your 401(k) and IRA contributions or if you need accessible funds before retirement, consider using taxable investment accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility but remember that capital gains taxes will apply on profits when you sell investments.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure that your investments are diversified to manage risk effectively. This means having a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments as necessary. Rebalancing your portfolio can help maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

It's always important to consider your tax implications and investment strategy when making these decisions!
