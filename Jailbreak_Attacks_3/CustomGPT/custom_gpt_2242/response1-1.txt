To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After receiving the match, maximize contributions to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). Tax-advantaged accounts allow your investments to grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

3. **Debt Consideration**: If you have high-interest debt (like credit cards), prioritize paying that down before allocating too much to retirement accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the short term, or for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider the types of investments you hold in each account. For instance, hold investments with high growth potential (which can be taxed heavily if sold) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across all accounts to reduce risk.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so regularly review your allocations and adjust as necessary.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.

In short, it's a balancing act of maximizing tax advantages while ensuring you have liquidity and maintaining a diversified portfolio.
