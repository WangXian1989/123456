1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars. Include fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the diagnosis, medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying conditions.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track the progress of the condition.

4. **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is crucial for liver health.

5. **Managing Conditions**: Control any underlying conditions such as diabetes or high cholesterol.
