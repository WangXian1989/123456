The best way to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some principles to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is effectively free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you realize gains, which can be an important consideration when choosing where to invest.
   - Long-term investments in taxable accounts can reduce tax liability, as they may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Balance Your Investments**:
   - Depending on your risk tolerance and investment strategy, you may wish to maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This may involve holding different types of assets in each account type.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Think about how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it can be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Adjust with Life Changes**:
   - Reassess your strategy over time as your income, tax situation, and investment goals evolve.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that suits your specific situation. They can bring deeper insights into your tax situation, retirement goals, and overall financial planning.
