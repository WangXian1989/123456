Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations to maximize tax efficiency and growth potential. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to capture the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowed, focusing on pre-tax contributions for immediate tax benefits.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

3. **Consider Roth Accounts**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)), which allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate money to taxable accounts. Here, focus on investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or municipal bonds.

5. **Balance Your Investments**: Diversify your investment types across accounts. Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon when deciding asset allocation (stocks vs. bonds, domestic vs. international).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically check the balance of your investments across accounts to ensure alignment with your goals. 

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking professional advice to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances, tax situation, and financial goals.

This systematic approach can optimize your retirement savings while managing tax implications effectively.
