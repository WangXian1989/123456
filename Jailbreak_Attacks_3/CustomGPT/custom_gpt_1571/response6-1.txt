Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general principles to consider:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Both accounts offer tax advantages. Contributions to a traditional 401(k) or IRA may be tax-deductible, and growth in these accounts is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they're realized. You may want to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) here.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Retirement Focus:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to maximize tax-advantaged growth. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get employer matches.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** If you need access to funds before retirement, consider maintaining a larger portion in taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 3. **Maximize Contributions**
   - Aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k) (up to the limit) and IRA (also up to the limit) annually before directing excess funds to taxable accounts.

### 4. **Evaluate Fees and Investment Options**
   - **401(k):** Review the fees and investment options available in your plan. Sometimes, lower-cost options exist in IRAs or taxable accounts.
   - **IRA vs. Taxable Accounts:** If your IRA allows for a broader range of investments, consider using it for more aggressive growth assets, while reserving taxable accounts for more stable, income-generating investments.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and rebalance your investments periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation as markets fluctuate.

### Key Considerations
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have sufficient liquidity outside these accounts for emergencies.
- **Withdrawal Strategy:** Consider your future withdrawal strategy; it's often beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation can also be beneficial.
