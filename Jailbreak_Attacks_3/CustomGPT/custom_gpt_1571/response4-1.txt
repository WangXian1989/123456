Distributing your money across different types of accounts—401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts—depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some principles you might consider:

1. **Tax Differences**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income in the year you contribute. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal, typically in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**: Traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars. Roth IRA withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments, and ordinary dividends are taxed in the year they're received.

2. **Retirement Goals**:
   - If your goal is long-term retirement savings, prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, especially if your employer offers a match on the 401(k).
   - If you wish to withdraw funds before retirement, consider adding more to your taxable account for liquidity.

3. **Investment Time Horizon**:
   - Invest in higher-risk assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where gains can grow unhindered by taxes.
   - Use more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications from dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments among stocks, bonds, or other asset classes in all accounts to balance risk and returns.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Ideally, you'll want to draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes over your retirement period.

By evaluating these factors and considering your unique financial situation, age, and risk tolerance, you can design a distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals. It's also wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
