I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly impact liver health. Avoiding alcohol and reducing fatty, sugary, and processed foods is often recommended.

2. **Medications:** Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage the disease or its symptoms.

3. **Regular Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and detect any progression of the disease.

4. **Treating Underlying Conditions:** Conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol should be properly managed to protect liver health.

5. **Potential Procedures:** In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or even liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
