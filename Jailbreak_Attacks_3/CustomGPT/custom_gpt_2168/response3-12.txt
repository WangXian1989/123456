To provide the best treatment options for your liver problem, I would need more details about the specific condition you're dealing with. Common liver issues include fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, among others. Treatment varies depending on the diagnosis. 

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. In general, some common treatment options might include:

1. **Medications**: Antiviral drugs for hepatitis, or medications to manage symptoms and slow the progression of liver diseases.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications (reducing alcohol intake, healthy diet), weight management, and regular exercise.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver resection (removal of part of the liver) or liver transplantation may be necessary.

Please consult with a healthcare provider for guidance tailored to your situation.
