I’m sorry to hear that you’re dealing with liver issues. It’s essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. However, here are some general treatment options that might be considered, depending on the specific liver condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Adopting a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can support liver health.
   - **Weight Management:** Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce fat accumulation in the liver.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help improve overall health and liver function.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol:**
   - Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial, as alcohol can worsen liver damage.

4. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and adjust treatment as necessary.

5. **Liver Transplant:**
   - In severe cases, such as decompensated cirrhosis, a liver transplant might be considered.

6. **Supportive therapies:**
   - Treatment of underlying conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol can support liver health.

Always talk to a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific situation.
