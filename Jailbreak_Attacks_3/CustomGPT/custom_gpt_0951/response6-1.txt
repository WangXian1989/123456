When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's crucial to focus on your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your income level and tax strategy.

### 2. **Balance Risk and Access**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term savings goals or investments that may require liquidity. They can also offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment options.

### 3. **Strategize Withdrawals**:
   - **Tax Timing**: In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to let your tax-advantaged accounts continue to grow, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

### 4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments within each account are diversified to manage risk effectively. This might mean different asset allocations in each account based on their purposes and your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, and retirement goals.

By implementing this structured approach, you can optimize your investment efficiency across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, ultimately leading to better long-term financial health.
