Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out your IRA (especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, which can offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement) before putting extra into a taxable account. 

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - 401(k) and traditional IRAs offer tax deferral, meaning you won't pay taxes until you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals.
   - Taxable accounts will be subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes to manage risk.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an adequate emergency savings fund outside of these accounts for immediate needs.

6. **Personal Goals and Timeline**: Adjust your contributions based on major life goals (like buying a house, education, etc.) and your timeline for each.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
