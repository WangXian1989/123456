To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to meet any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments to spread risk. For retirement accounts like a 401(k) or IRA, focus on a mix of equity, fixed income, and perhaps alternatives based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (assuming certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income (like dividends and capital gains) is taxed in the year earned. Consider holding bonds or high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on interest and dividends.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk profile.

5. **Explore Future Needs**: Plan for short-term vs. long-term needs. If you anticipate needing money sooner, keep more liquid investments (like cash or short-term bonds) in taxable accounts to avoid penalties on early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

Before making decisions, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal circumstances.
