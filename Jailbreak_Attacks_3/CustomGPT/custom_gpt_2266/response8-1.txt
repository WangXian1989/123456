Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts grow tax-deferred, making them suitable for long-term growth. Prioritize maxing out contributions to these accounts up to the IRS limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains, like stocks, which might be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Consider holding higher-growth assets, like stocks, in these accounts to maximize tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Opt for income-generating investments judiciously, as dividends and interest are taxed in the year theyâ€™re received.

4. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan how and when you plan to withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Generally:
   - Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.
   - Consider tax implications of withdrawals from your IRA or 401(k), as they may be taxed as ordinary income.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help tailor a strategy that fits your unique circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can help ensure a balanced approach to managing your investments across different account types.
