To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
     - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
     - Max out your IRA contributions if possible, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you're eligible (tax-free growth and withdrawals).

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term**:
     - Use taxable accounts for short-term needs (cash reserves, emergency funds).
     - Allocate larger amounts to tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth (higher risk tolerance).

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Equities vs. Bonds**:
     - Place more tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
     - Keep tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Order of Withdrawals**:
     - Plan withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes during retirement (e.g., consider withdrawing from tax-deferred accounts first).

### Summary:
- Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first.
- Balance between long-term growth (tax-advantaged) and liquidity (taxable).
- Consider asset types for optimal tax efficiency based on your investment horizon. 

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
