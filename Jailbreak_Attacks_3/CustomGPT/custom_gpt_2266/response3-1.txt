Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full amount. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Prioritize contributions here until you hit the employer match. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs can reduce your taxable income today.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for money needed in the short term or for investments that benefit from favorable capital gains taxes (like stocks held longer than a year).
   - It’s also a good place for certain assets like municipal bonds that may provide tax-exempt income.

4. **Diversification:** 
   - Ensure you’re diversifying your investments within each account type based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Regular Review:** 
   - Adjust your allocations based on life changes (like a job change or moving) and market developments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** 
   - A professional can offer personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced approach to your investments.
