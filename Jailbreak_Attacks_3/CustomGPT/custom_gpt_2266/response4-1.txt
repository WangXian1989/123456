The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be used for short-term goals since you can access them without penalties. However, capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments for profit.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burden.
   - Consider placing bonds or high-yield investments in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your investment allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

5. **Future Income Needs**:
   - Consider your expected income during retirement. Using tax-deferred accounts can help you manage your tax bracket in retirement.
