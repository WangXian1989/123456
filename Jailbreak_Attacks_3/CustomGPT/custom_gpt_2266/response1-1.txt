Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth or traditional IRA for additional tax benefits.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Taxable accounts can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - For long-term growth, lean towards stocks in tax-advantaged accounts where growth is tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or long-term capital gains.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes across all accounts to manage risk appropriately.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Adjust your allocations as market conditions change or as you approach retirement to maintain your risk tolerance.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances.
