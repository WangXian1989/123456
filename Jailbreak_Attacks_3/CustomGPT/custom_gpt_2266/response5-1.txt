Sure! Here's a general approach to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Start by maximizing employer match if available; this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute enough to receive the full match.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Max out if you can.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions may reduce taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after taxes, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for money you may need before retirement. Capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments, so consider tax-efficient investments.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k):** Typically limited investment options. Choose a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA:** More flexibility in choosing assets; consider a mix of ETFs, mutual funds, and individual stocks tailored to your goals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts, ideally covering 3-6 months of expenses.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your portfolio allocation and contributions as your financial situation and goals change.

### Final Note
Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
