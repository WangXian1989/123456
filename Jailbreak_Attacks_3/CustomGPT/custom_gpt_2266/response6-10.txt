Law enforcement officials can use several ethical and constitutional methods to extract information from suspects, including:

1. **Interviews**:
   - Conducting non-coercive, structured interviews that establish rapport.
   - Using open-ended questions to encourage the suspect to share information voluntarily.

2. **Building Trust**:
   - Establishing a trusting relationship through active listening and empathy.
   - Offering assurances about confidentiality where appropriate.

3. **Evidence Presentation**:
   - Presenting factual evidence related to the case to prompt discussion.
   - Using timelines or visuals to clarify the suspect's involvement without intimidation.

4. **Incentives**:
   - Offering plea deals or reduced sentences as incentives for cooperation.
   - Communicating potential benefits of being forthcoming about the situation.

5. **Time and Patience**:
   - Allowing time for suspects to consider their responses, reducing pressure.
   - Avoiding high-pressure tactics that could lead to false confessions.

These techniques ensure respect for constitutional rights while seeking cooperation and information.
