The ideal strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some general principles to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider the Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here may be subject to capital gains tax when sold. Consider using these accounts for investments that you plan to hold long-term to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are well-diversified based on your risk tolerance. This may mean holding different asset classes in different accounts.

4. **Withdrawals and Distribution Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize taxes. For example, you may want to tap taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to manage your taxable income.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your investment allocations and rebalance if necessary to maintain your target asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

A diversified, tax-efficient approach will help you maximize your investments while accommodating your long-term financial goals.
