To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA first, especially if your employer offers a match on your 401(k), as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth.
   - **IRA**: Similar options exist (traditional vs. Roth). Consider your expected future tax situation when choosing.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, so this should be your last priority for growth investments. Use these accounts for short-term needs or investments that generate qualified dividends.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a diversified mix of funds. Consider target-date funds if you're unsure about managing the allocation.
   - **IRA**: You might want to tilt towards more aggressive growth investments since they can compound without immediate tax consequences.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs that have lower turnover, which can minimize capital gains distributions.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, plan to withdraw funds strategically to minimize taxes. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (Roth IRAs) to maximize tax efficiency.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

Consider your personal financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance when making these decisions, and consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
