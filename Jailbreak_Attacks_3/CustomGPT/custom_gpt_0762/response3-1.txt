Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon for needing the funds. Here are some general guidelines to consider for effective distribution:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Contribute the maximum allowed to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional IRA:**
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (after-tax).
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) may offer immediate tax benefits.

3. **Distribute to Taxable Accounts Wisely:**
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or investments that generate taxable income (e.g., bonds), as you may want to avoid tax-inefficient assets in your taxable account.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments, like index funds or long-term capital gains-generating assets, in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Maintain a balanced investment portfolio across all accounts, focusing on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in easily accessible accounts before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy in advance for retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to minimize taxes, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your strategy according to your unique financial situation and goals.

Evaluating these factors can help you create a distribution strategy that best suits your financial needs and objectives.
