To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k)):**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth). These accounts provide tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Consider Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar to a 401(k) but with potentially lower contribution limits. Also offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (if qualified) are tax-free. Good for those who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible for investment, but gains are subject to capital gains taxes. Useful for short-term goals or investments not suitable for retirement accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account, diversify your investments based on risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Evaluate Contributions Annually:**
   - Review your contributions and investment allocations annually, adjusting based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice that considers your unique financial situation, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies.

Balancing these accounts effectively can help you optimize tax benefits and achieve your long-term financial goals.
