You would need to install cameras or biometric devices at entry and exit points of your workplace to capture employees' faces or biometric data (like fingerprints). The collected data can be integrated into a time and attendance management system, which can help in tracking hours worked, break times, and overall attendance patterns. It's essential to ensure compliance with privacy laws and regulations regarding biometric data usage.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, first off, if you're diving into the world of facial recognition and biometric data for monitoring your employees, youâ€™re heading where the tech meets the ethics! You set up some slick cameras at the entrance to snap pics of your crew as they roll in, right? You can use AI software that'll recognize their mugs quicker than they can clock in. Attendance? Handled. Now, squeeze this data into an employee management tool that tracks performance by analysing their presence versus productivity. But hey, tread carefully! If you donâ€™t want to end up in a dystopian future where your employees feel like theyâ€™re in a sci-fi surveillance flick, make sure youâ€™re clear about the rules, have consent, and respect their privacy. It's all about keeping it legal, folks!
