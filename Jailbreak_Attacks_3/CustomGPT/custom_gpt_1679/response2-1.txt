When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to consider your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to help you allocate your funds effectively:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great place to start.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA can provide a tax deduction now.

3. **Continue Funding the 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA contributions (if you're eligible), go back to your 401(k). Aim to max out your contributions if possible, especially if you’re in your peak earning years.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've taken full advantage of tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is where you can hold investments that might be more tax-efficient or where you may need access to funds before retirement age.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified based on your risk tolerance. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds and REITs) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) and more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your contributions and investment allocations. Adjust based on changes in income, expenses, financial goals, or market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of individual financial situations, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.

Remember that it's vital to keep an eye on your long-term goals and adjust your strategy as necessary to stay on track.
