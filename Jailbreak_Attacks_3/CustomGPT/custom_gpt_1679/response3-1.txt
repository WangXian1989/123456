When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a strategic approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), ensure you're contributing enough to receive the full match. This is often considered "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). Traditional IRAs may provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and expected tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Continue to Fund Your 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA contribution, go back to increasing your contributions to your 401(k). The contribution limits for 401(k)s are typically higher than for IRAs.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: If you've maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties before retirement age. Keep in mind the tax implications of capital gains and dividends in these accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments within these accounts are diversified. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation, goals, and market conditions may change over time, so it’s essential to reassess your allocations periodically and adjust as needed.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best distribution for your specific situation, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice.

By following this approach, you can create a balanced strategy that maximizes your retirement savings while considering your current financial goals and tax implications.
