When determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment options. Here are some guidelines to help you allocate your funds effectively:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Focus on maximizing your contribution limit if you can afford it (for 2023, the limit is $22,500, or $30,000 if youâ€™re age 50 or older).

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - If you qualify, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. The contribution limit for IRAs for 2023 is $6,500, or $7,500 if you are age 50 or older.
   - Choose a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you want to reduce taxable income now, a traditional IRA may be better.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may be less tax-efficient, such as real estate or actively managed funds.
   - Keep in mind that you'll pay capital gains tax on profits from these investments, so consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes on their potential growth.

5. **Regular Review and Adjustments:**
   - Periodically review your allocations to ensure they remain aligned with your financial goals and market conditions.
   - Rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Ultimately, the right distribution will depend on your individual circumstances, so it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.
