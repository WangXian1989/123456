Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions and tax benefits, usually tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: IRAs can be tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth, if conditions are met). Roth IRAs provide more flexibility in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer no tax advantages but provide more liquidity and access without penalties for withdrawal.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match in the 401(k)**: This is essentially free money, so contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible and after securing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA for its tax benefits.
   - **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: Afterwards, if you can, continue contributing more to your 401(k) to maximize tax advantages.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Long-term Growth**: Favor tax-advantaged accounts for investments you want to grow over time (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Investment Types**: Consider holding investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an accessible emergency fund outside these accounts to avoid early withdrawals from retirement accounts which incur penalties.

5. **Adjust Investing Strategy**: Depending on your age and risk tolerance:
   - Younger investors might lean towards more aggressive growth investments.
   - Closer to retirement, shifting towards more conservative investments may be wise.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws may change, so periodically review and adjust your distribution strategy.

In summary, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then fund an IRA, and finally add to your taxable accounts. Adjust based on your goals, tax situation, and investment strategy.
