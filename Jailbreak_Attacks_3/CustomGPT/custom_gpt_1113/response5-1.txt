To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA since they offer tax advantages (traditional and Roth options).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxes, such as index funds or municipal bonds.

### 2. **Investment Options**
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment options. Focus on low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Typically offers a wider variety of investments. Consider diversifying across stocks, bonds, and real estate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that you can control the timing of capital gains.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Keep aware of annual contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (with an additional $7,500 for those over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (with a $1,000 catch-up).

### 4. **Withdrawal Considerations**
   - Plan for the tax implications when withdrawing funds from these accounts. For example, withdrawals from a traditional IRA are taxed as income, whereas Roth IRAs can be withdrawn tax-free under certain conditions.

### 5. **Long-Term Goals**
   - Align your distributions with your long-term financial goals, such as retirement age or purchasing a home.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your investment allocation to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
