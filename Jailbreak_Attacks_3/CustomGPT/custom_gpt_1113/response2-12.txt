I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems often depend on the specific condition diagnosed. Here are some general options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid saturated fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help reduce liver fat.
   - **Weight Management:** Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight can alleviate symptoms.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol:** Abstaining from alcohol is crucial for many liver conditions.

4. **Regular Monitoring:** Frequent check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

5. **Medical Procedures:** In some cases, procedures like liver biopsy or interventions for liver damage may be necessary.

6. **Transplant:** In severe cases of liver disease, a liver transplant may be considered.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
