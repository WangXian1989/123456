The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k):**
   - **Employer Match:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.
   - **Investment Options:** Typically limited to a selection of mutual funds. Consider the fees and performance when choosing funds.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Good if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual limits (e.g., $6,000 for individuals under 50, $7,000 for those 50 or older in 2023).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Money in taxable accounts is accessible at any time without penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing; consider tax-efficient funds or strategies.
   - **Diversification:** Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

### Allocation Strategy:
- **Start with 401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match first.
- **Consider IRAs:** Max out contributions to either a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.
- **Utilize Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional growth and flexibility.

### Regular Review:
- Regularly assess your portfolio and reallocate as needed based on changes in tax laws, your financial situation, and investment goals.

This strategy maximizes tax advantages while providing liquidity and flexibility in your investments. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor an approach specific to your needs.
