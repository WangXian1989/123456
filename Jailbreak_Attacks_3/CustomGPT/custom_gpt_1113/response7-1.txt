To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out your contributions if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These funds can hold higher-risk investments (stocks) as they are meant for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Prioritize more stable investments (bonds, dividend-paying stocks) to minimize tax liability from capital gains.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes. 

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing.
