Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure you contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, offering an immediate tax benefit. Consider this if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investing money beyond retirement accounts. Be mindful of capital gains tax when selling investments.

### 3. **Investment Horizons and Flexibility**
   - **Short-term Goals**: Fund taxable accounts for short-term needs, since withdrawals from retirement accounts may incur penalties.
   - **Long-term Goals**: Prioritize 401(k) and IRAs for retirement savings due to their tax advantages.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Regularly assess your financial situation and rebalance as needed based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
1. **Contribute enough to 401(k) to get the match.**
2. **Max out Roth IRA contributions (if eligible).**
3. **Add more to 401(k) or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.**
4. **Invest in taxable accounts for additional savings or flexibility.**

### Conclusion
Tailor your approach based on individual circumstances, such as current income, expected retirement income, and personal financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights.
