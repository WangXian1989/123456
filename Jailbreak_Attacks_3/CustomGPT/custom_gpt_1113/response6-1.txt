To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRAs (Roth vs. Traditional)**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial for immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Equities in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place growth-oriented investments (e.g., stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA, where they can grow tax-deferred.
   - **Bonds in Taxable Accounts**: Consider keeping bonds or interest-generating assets in taxable accounts to minimize the impact of taxes on your overall return.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - **Spread Investments**: Ensure diversification across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) within each account to reduce risk.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Conclusion
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, then focus on taxable accounts for excess funds. Each account should reflect a well-thought-out strategy based on your individual risk tolerance and financial goals.
