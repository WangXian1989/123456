I'm not a doctor, but there are a few common treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice, but generally, some approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet low in fats, sugars, and salt can help. Avoiding alcohol is also crucial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific condition, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to track liver function can help manage the condition effectively.

4. **Weight Management**: For non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, weight loss through diet and exercise is often recommended.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver failure or tumors, surgical options may be considered, including liver transplantation.

Please consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
