To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it is essential to consider various factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here's a comprehensive approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to secure any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), either traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation.

3. **Fill Up 401(k)**: If possible, increase your 401(k) contributions to the maximum limit as it offers tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate taxable income, such as bonds, or for savings that you might need in the short term (3-5 years).

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**: As you near retirement, consider the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type to minimize your tax burden.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure that you periodically review and adjust your investment allocation based on market conditions and your financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice specific to your circumstances and objectives.
