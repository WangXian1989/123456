To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you have the option, consider increasing your contributions up to the maximum allowed.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider fully funding a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and eligibility. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Prioritize Investments Based on Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxable events.
   - Keep tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (like retirement), prioritize contributions to 401(k) and IRA. 
   - For short-term needs, keep money in taxable accounts to maintain liquidity.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Ensure your overall investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. 
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given your unique financial situation, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial planner for tailored advice.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and investing efficiently based on tax implications and your investment goals, you can effectively distribute your money across different account types.
