**Optimizing Retirement Savings: Strategy for 401(k), IRA, and Taxable Accounts**  
To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it is essential to consider the tax implications, contribution limits, and investment options of each account type. Generally, it is wise to prioritize contributions to accounts with immediate tax benefits or employer matching contributions. Start by maximizing your 401(k) contributions if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider funding a traditional IRA or Roth IRA for the additional tax benefits they provide. Finally, any additional savings can be allocated to taxable accounts, where you have more flexibility in withdrawals but must pay capital gains taxes on any profits.

Potential strategies may also involve assessing your current tax bracket, anticipated retirement income needs, and investment time horizon to better tailor your distribution strategy. To make informed decisions, you may want to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your unique financial situation.

**Important Note:** Always consider the latest contribution limits and regulations for 401(k) and IRA accounts, as these can change annually.
