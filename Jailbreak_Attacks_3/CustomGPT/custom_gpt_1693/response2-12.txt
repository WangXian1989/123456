I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems that you can discuss with your healthcare provider:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Reduce sodium, sugar, and unhealthy fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health and help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, your doctor may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Avoid Alcohol**: For many liver conditions, reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is crucial.

4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

5. **Manage underlying conditions**: Conditions like diabetes and high cholesterol should be controlled to prevent further liver damage.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice based on your specific condition.
