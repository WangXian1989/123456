To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income. Taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k) with tax deferral until withdrawal. Consider a **Roth IRA** for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you qualify.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and realized gains are taxable in the year they're earned.

### 2. **Determine Your Goals**:
   - Retirement needs, short-term goals, and expected time horizons dictate your distribution strategy.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRAs**: If possible, also maximize contributions to your IRA (Roth or Traditional) given their tax advantages.
   - **Fund Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding taxable accounts for greater flexibility and access.

### 4. **Investment Strategies**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Use for higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks) since gains aren’t taxed until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize annual tax liabilities.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized strategies, a financial advisor can tailor approaches based on your specific situation and goals.

By balancing growth potential with tax efficiency, you can optimize your investments across all account types.
