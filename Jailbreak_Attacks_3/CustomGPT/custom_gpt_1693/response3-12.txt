   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.
   - Limiting alcohol intake.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may help manage symptoms or address underlying issues (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Staying away from substances that can harm the liver, such as certain over-the-counter medications, alcohol, and illicit drugs.
