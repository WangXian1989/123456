Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Here’s a comprehensive strategy to consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, often includes matching contributions. Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income. Taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Can be traditional or Roth. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invested money that doesn’t have tax advantages. Capital gains are taxed when you sell investments.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

### 3. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) before fully funding a taxable account.
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for potential tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 4. **Diversification Strategies:**
   - **401(k):** Utilize a mix of indexed funds, target-date funds, or diversified mutual funds to spread risk.
   - **IRA:** Focus on a balance of stocks and bonds according to your risk tolerance, potentially adding international investments for diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy Planning:**
   - Plan your withdrawals based on tax brackets in retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first and let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across accounts to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider getting personalized advice to tailor a strategy based on your complete financial picture.

### Sample Contribution Strategy:
1. **Contribute to 401(k)** to meet employer match.
2. **Max out IRA contributions** (or Roth if eligible).
3. **Direct remaining funds** to the taxable account for flexibility and diversification.

### Final Thoughts:
Maintain flexibility and adaptability in your strategy. Regular reviews based on changing financial situations or market conditions will help ensure you stay on track toward your retirement goals.
