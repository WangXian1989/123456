Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a comprehensive approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Take advantage of employer matching contributions first. Contribute enough to receive the full match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Assess income limits and tax implications for each.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & Traditional IRA)**:
     - Contributions reduce taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**:
     - Contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Withdrawals are tax-free in retirement if conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized. Use for liquidity and non-retirement goals.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Higher Growth Investments in Taxable Accounts**:
     - Consider holding investments with lower turnover to minimize tax impact, such as index funds.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Investments in IRAs**:
     - Real estate investments, bonds, or high-dividend stocks can generate income that is taxed at a lower rate in non-taxable accounts.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level without incurring significant tax consequences.

### Summary
- **Prioritize 401(k) contributions to the company match.**
- **Use IRAs for tax-efficient growth.**
- **Manage taxable accounts for liquidity and specific short-term needs.**

### Conclusion
Evaluate your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation annually to ensure that your distribution aligns with your long-term objectives. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights.
