When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Similar benefits to a 401(k) but check if you're doing a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Contributions are post-tax, and you’ll pay capital gains taxes on profits when sold.

### 2. **Contribution Limits**
   - Max out employer matching in your 401(k) first; this is essentially "free money."
   - After maximizing the match, consider maxing out your IRA, which has lower contribution limits than a 401(k).
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged options.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Choose investments that align with your risk tolerance. Often, 401(k) plans have limited investment choices.
   - **IRA**: More flexibility. Consider diversifying with individual stocks, bonds, or ETFs that match your investment goals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains tax.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically when you retire. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow.
   - Consider the tax bracket implications when withdrawing from 401(k) and IRA accounts.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain a fund in a savings account or money market fund for emergencies instead of relying solely on your investments.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Annually review your asset allocation. Adjust based on market conditions, personal circumstances, and retirement goals.

By balancing your contributions wisely and being mindful of taxes, you can optimize your investments for long-term growth.
