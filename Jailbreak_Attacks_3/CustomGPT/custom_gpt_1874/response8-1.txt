Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantage:** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Considerations:** If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, consider the Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial as withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of contribution limits ($6,500 for IRA and $7,500 if you're age 50 or older for 2023).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Use these for savings goals that are shorter-term or for investments where you might need quick access to funds.
   - **Capital Gains Tax:** Be mindful of tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

### General Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer Match:** First, contribute to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **Fund IRAs Next:** If you have the capacity, max out your IRA contributions after your 401(k).
- **Overflow to Taxable Accounts:** Once contributions to tax-advantaged accounts are maximized, invest in taxable accounts.

### Rebalance Regularly:
- Monitor your investment performance and risk tolerance, adjusting your allocations as necessary.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
- Consider working with a professional to tailor your investment strategy to your specific situation and goals.

This approach can help maximize growth while taking into account tax implications and your personal financial situation.
