To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Invest primarily in tax-deferred traditional options or employer match contributions, which reduces your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Utilize a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower capital gains distributions.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Short-term goals (e.g., saving for a house): Prioritize taxable accounts for easier access to funds.
   - Long-term goals (e.g., retirement): Allocate more to 401(k) and IRA for tax benefits.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, stocks can go in tax-deferred accounts, while bonds and cash equivalents may be better suited for taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out employer matching in your 401(k) first, then contribute to your IRA, and finally, add any remaining funds to your taxable account.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Monitor and rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation and adjust for changes in your financial situation or goals.

6. **Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.

By balancing these factors, you can create a comprehensive strategy that aligns with your financial goals while maximizing tax efficiency.
