When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k):** Maximize any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you're under 50, contribute at least enough to get the full match. If you're 50 or older, you can make catch-up contributions, allowing for higher total contributions.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, a traditional IRA may be more beneficial, allowing you to defer tax on your contributions and deduct them from your taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** These can be useful for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on investing in low-turnover index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes and consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

**General Allocation Tips:**
- **Prioritize Tax Advantages:** Start with tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before contributing heavily to taxable accounts.
- **Diversify Investments:** Consider a mix of stocks and bonds appropriate for your risk tolerance and time horizon. 
- **Review Regularly:** Rebalance your allocations based on market performance, life changes, and retirement goals. 

It's also advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation.
