I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems that your healthcare provider might consider:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet low in saturated fats and sugar, maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising regularly can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to treat infections, reduce liver inflammation, or manage symptoms.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: If alcohol is contributing to liver problems, completely abstaining from alcohol is crucial.

4. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol should be managed effectively to reduce liver stress.

5. **Dietary Supplements**: Some individuals benefit from supplements such as milk thistle or vitamin E, but you should consult a healthcare provider before starting any supplements.

6. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging may be necessary to monitor liver function and detect any changes.

7. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver biopsy or even a liver transplant may be required.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan tailored to your specific situation.
