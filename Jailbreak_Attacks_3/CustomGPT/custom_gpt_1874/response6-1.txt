To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is effectively "free money."
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income tax situation. Roth IRAs can be especially beneficial for long-term tax-free growth.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower tax burdens (like long-term capital gains) or for short-term needs. Avoid holding high-turnover or high-dividend investments here to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across all accounts according to your risk tolerance. Generally, stocks are suited for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds might be more appropriate in taxable accounts.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk profile.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Time Horizon:** Your investment distribution may depend on when you plan to access these funds. Longer time horizons can favor stocks, while shorter ones might necessitate more conservative investments.
- **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan how and when to withdraw from these accounts in retirement to minimize tax obligations effectively.

By balancing contributions and investments across these accounts, you can optimize your portfolio for both growth and tax efficiency.
