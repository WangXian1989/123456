Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k). This is beneficial if your plan offers low-cost investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings, especially for goals within the next 5-10 years. These accounts offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals but may have tax implications on gains.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts while holding higher-growth, potentially less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Review Annually**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
