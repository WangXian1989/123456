When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to maximize tax efficiency and growth potential:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First (401(k) & IRA)**
- **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Focus on Roth IRA (if applicable)**: If you're eligible, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
- **Invest After Maximizing Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, direct your additional savings to taxable accounts.
- **Use Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on low-turnover index funds or ETFs that generate fewer taxable events and qualified dividends.

### 3. **Allocation Strategy**
- **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance; younger investors might prefer equities, while those closer to retirement may opt for bonds.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
- **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of your current tax bracket and the potential tax implications of withdrawing funds from taxable accounts versus tax-deferred accounts.

### Summary
- **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for contributions.**
- **Invest in flexible, tax-efficient assets within taxable accounts.** 

By structuring your investments this way, you can optimize for growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
