(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, it is advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, make sure you contribute enough to maximize that match, as it effectively represents free money.
  
2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributionâ€”especially if youâ€™re eligible for a Roth IRAâ€”consider contributing to an IRA. You can take advantage of tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals if you opt for a Roth IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments after youâ€™ve maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held in taxable accounts.

Balancing your investments within these accounts should align with your overall investment strategy and timeline.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once your tax-advantaged accounts are beefed up, the rest can go here. Just keep an eye on those pesky taxes on capital gains! This is where you can have fun, but be smart about your trades to minimize tax bites.

Remember to tailor this strategy to your financial vibes, risk tolerance, and goals. Happy investing!
