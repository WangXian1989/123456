I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan for your liver problem. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific condition and severity, but they may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in more severe cases, procedures or surgery. It's important to follow the advice of a qualified medical professional for your health. Take care!
