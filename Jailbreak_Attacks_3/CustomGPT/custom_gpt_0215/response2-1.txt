Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a breakdown of each option with pros and cons to help you decide the best approach:

### 1. **401(k)**:
- **Pros**:
  - Tax-deferred growth until retirement.
  - Employer matching contributions (free money).
  - Higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
- **Cons**:
  - Limited investment choices depending on the plan.
  - Early withdrawal penalties if taken out before age 59½ (with some exceptions).
  
### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
- **Traditional IRA**:
  - **Pros**:
    - Contributions may be tax-deductible.
    - Tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
  - **Cons**:
    - Same early withdrawal penalties as a 401(k).
  
- **Roth IRA**:
  - **Pros**:
    - Tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
    - Flexible withdrawal rules (contributions can be taken out anytime without penalties).
  - **Cons**:
    - Income limits for contributions.
    - Contributions are not tax-deductible.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
- **Pros**:
  - Flexible access to funds (no penalties for withdrawals).
  - Variety of investments without contribution limits.
- **Cons**:
  - Tax on interest, dividends, and capital gains, which may reduce overall returns.
  
### **Recommended Strategy**:
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - If you are in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be more beneficial.
   - If you anticipate being in the same or a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be suitable.
3. **Diversify Across Accounts**: Once you have the employer match, balance contributions among the accounts based on your tax strategy and immediate needs.

4. **Build Taxable Account**: For flexibility and short-term goals, maintain a taxable account for liquidity.

### Conclusion:
A mix of these accounts usually works best. Try to maximize contributions based on tax efficiency, immediate liquidity needs, and long-term growth potential. For specific advice tailored to your personal situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

Happy investing!
