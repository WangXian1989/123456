To distribute your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax deferrals or deductions.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k) ($22,500 for 2023, $30,000 if over 50) and IRAs ($6,500 for 2023, $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - Determine your investment strategy. 401(k) plans often have limited investment choices compared to IRAs and taxable accounts.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains. Consider holding income-generating assets in taxable accounts for preferential tax treatment.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for retirement withdrawals by considering the tax implications of each account.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and tax strategies.
