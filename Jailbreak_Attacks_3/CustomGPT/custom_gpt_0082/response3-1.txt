Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you qualify, as IRAs can provide tax benefits.
   - Focus on traditional or Roth IRAs based on your tax situation. 

3. **Fill Up the 401(k)**: Once you’ve maxed out your IRA, consider contributing more to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This offers liquidity and flexibility, and you can manage capital gains taxes efficiently.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Make sure to have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Adjust Based on Goals**: Tailor your allocations based on specific goals, such as retirement age and lifestyle needs. Review your allocations periodically.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, especially with tax implications, working with a financial planner can help optimize your strategy.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your investments among these different account types.
