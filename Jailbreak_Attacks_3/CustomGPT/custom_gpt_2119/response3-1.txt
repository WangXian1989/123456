To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand the Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Choose this for max tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your tax situation, select the one that benefits you most.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Offer flexibility with no contribution limits or penalties for withdrawals. However, investment gains are taxed, so consider using this for short-term needs or taxable bonds.

2. **Assess Your Retirement Goals**: 
   - Determine how much you need for retirement and the timeline for when you'll need the funds. 

3. **Balance Contributions**: 
   - Prioritize maxing out employer-matching contributions to your 401(k) as that is essentially free money.
   - Next, consider funding your IRA, especially if it’s a Roth IRA, for its future tax benefits.
   - After those, contribute to your taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

4. **Consider Investment Options**: 
   - The type of investments you hold in each account can minimize taxes. For instance, hold higher-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth, and hold tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts (like index funds).

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: 
   - Monitor your investments and overall strategy annually or semi-annually to ensure you’re on track with your financial goals and adjust based on changes in income, market conditions, or life circumstances. 

By strategically diversifying your investments across these accounts, you can work towards achieving a balanced approach to your financial goals while maximizing tax advantages.
