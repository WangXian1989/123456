Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, like your financial goals, investment timeline, and tax situation. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA is often beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free. A Traditional IRA could provide immediate tax benefits if you need to lower your taxable income now.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've funded your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k). This provides tax-deferred growth, and higher contribution limits are typically available compared to an IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for money that you might need sooner than in retirement, or for additional investments that may be more tax-efficient, like stocks or funds that generate qualified dividends.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Balance your investments based on tax rates and investment returns. Generally, place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities efficiently.

6. **Regularly Reassess**: Adjust your contributions and distribution strategy based on your evolving financial situation, market conditions, and retirement timeline.
