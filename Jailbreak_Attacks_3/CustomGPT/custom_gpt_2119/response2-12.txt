I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice. They might recommend options like lifestyle changes (diet and exercise), medications, or potentially more advanced treatments depending on the specific liver condition you have. It's crucial to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your needs.
