I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems that are commonly pursued. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized medical advice. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Medication Therapy**: 
   - Antiviral medications for hepatitis.
   - Medications to reduce liver inflammation and improve function.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Adopting a healthy diet low in fat, sugar, and salt.
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.

3. **Alcohol Avoidance**: 
   - Complete abstinence from alcohol is crucial to prevent further damage.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

5. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary.

Always follow up with a healthcare provider for the best course of action tailored to your specific condition.
