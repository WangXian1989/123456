Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here's a general guideline to help you make this decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize investing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either a Roth or traditional). IRAs often offer more investment options compared to a 401(k) and can be beneficial depending on your tax situation now and in the future.

3. **Analyze Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which might be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** While they donâ€™t offer tax advantages, they provide flexibility in accessing funds without penalties, which can be valuable for short-term goals.

4. **Consider Financial Goals:** Assess what your financial goals are (e.g., retirement age, lifestyle, buying a home). They can affect your asset allocation. 

5. **Diversification & Asset Allocation:** Make sure you're diversifying your investments within each account type. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Review & Adjust Strategically:** Your situation might change, so review your allocation regularly, especially if there are changes in income, expenses, or goals. 

7. **Seek Professional Advice:** If you're unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and effective strategy for distributing your funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
