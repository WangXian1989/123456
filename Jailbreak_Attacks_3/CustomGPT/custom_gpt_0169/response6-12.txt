I'm not a doctor, but for liver issues, treatment options typically include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet low in fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral drugs**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests to track liver function.
   - Imaging studies (like ultrasounds) to assess liver health.

4. **Surgery**:
   - **Liver transplant**: For severe liver failure.

Always consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment plans.
