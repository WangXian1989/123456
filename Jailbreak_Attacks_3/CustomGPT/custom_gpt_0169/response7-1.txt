Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a basic strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - *Traditional IRA*: Tax-deductible contributions; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
     - *Roth IRA*: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Invest for Growth:**
   - Prioritize growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from potential tax deferral.

### 4. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely:**
   - Hold investments that generate favorable tax rates (like long-term capital gains) or tax-exempt securities (like municipal bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance.

### 6. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

### 7. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes during retirement.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: Up to the match, then consider additional contributions.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible.
- **Taxable Account**: Investment for flexibility and short-term needs after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.
