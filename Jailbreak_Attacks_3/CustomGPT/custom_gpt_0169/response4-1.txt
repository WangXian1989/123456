To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth 401(k)). This is beneficial for lowering taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes; consider holding tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize taxes.

3. **Diversification of Investments**: Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to manage risk.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**: Allocate investments based on tax efficiency:
   - **Tax-inefficient investments** (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - **Tax-efficient investments** (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Retirement Timeline**: Adjust contributions based on your retirement timeline. If retirement is far off, a heavier allocation in stocks within tax-advantaged accounts can yield growth.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your target asset mix.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals.
