Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider a Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA, which allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs, to minimize tax burdens.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on higher-growth investments here since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds) and sectors to mitigate risks.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement, considering tax implications from each account type.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations periodically to reflect changes in your financial situation or goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
