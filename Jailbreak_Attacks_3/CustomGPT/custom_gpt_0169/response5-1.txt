Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it first.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize funding your tax-advantaged accounts like an IRA and 401(k) since they provide tax benefits, either upfront or upon withdrawal.

3. **Tax Diversification**: Consider balancing contributions between pre-tax (401(k), traditional IRA) and after-tax (Roth IRA) accounts to diversify your tax exposure in retirement.

4. **Expenses and Goals**: If you expect to need funds before retirement, lean towards funding taxable accounts for more liquidity.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure each account is appropriately invested based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon, adjusting for any age-related shifts in strategy.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations to ensure they align with changing goals or market conditions.

It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
