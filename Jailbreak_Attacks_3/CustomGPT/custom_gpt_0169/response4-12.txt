I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Reduce salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats.
   - **Alcohol**: Avoid alcohol consumption.
   - **Weight Management**: Maintain a healthy weight through diet and exercise.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring and Follow-up**:
   - Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and make any necessary adjustments in treatment.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, liver transplant might be considered.

5. **Supplementation**:
   - Some might find benefits from vitamin E or milk thistle, but always consult a doctor before starting any supplements.

It's crucial to discuss your specific situation with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
