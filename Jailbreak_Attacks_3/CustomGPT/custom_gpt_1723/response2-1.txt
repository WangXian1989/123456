The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and time horizon for retirement. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money." Aim to contribute up to the maximum permissible limit if you can afford it.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly advantageous if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your current taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible. However, Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and investment timeline. Consider more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your IRA and 401(k) for long-term growth and more conservative investments (like bonds) in your taxable accounts for income.

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your investment goals and risk tolerance. This may include reallocating assets between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - In retirement, plan your withdrawals strategically. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to minimize tax implications on your IRA and 401(k) until required minimum distributions (RMDs) kick in.

### 6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**
   - Given the nuances of tax laws and investment strategies, it can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your specific situation.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Max out contributions to get the employer match.
2. **IRA**: Fund your IRA up to the limit.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, invest any remaining money into taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

This strategy balances growth potential with tax efficiency while taking advantage of available retirement benefits. Remember, individual circumstances vary, so adjust these suggestions to meet your personal financial situation and goals.
