While I can’t provide specific financial advice, I can offer general strategies on how to approach distributing your money among different account types like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some considerations:

1. **Contribution Limits and Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing this out if you have available funds and no higher return options elsewhere.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income, you may want to consider contributing to an IRA. Roth IRAs are tax-free during retirement, while traditional IRAs offer a tax deduction now. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional money into a taxable account. This provides flexibility, as you can withdraw funds without penalties (though you’ll pay capital gains tax).

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively and target a balanced portfolio that aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Rebalancing and Adjusting Strategy**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio in each account based on performance and changing financial goals.
