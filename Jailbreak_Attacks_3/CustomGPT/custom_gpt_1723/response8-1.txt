Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if your budget permits. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contribution, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you’re in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower one in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be more beneficial. Conversely, if your tax situation is expected to improve, a Roth IRA could be advantageous.
   - Taxable accounts can be utilized for investments that generate lower capital gains or for holding tax-efficient investments like index funds.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon:**
   - If you’re saving for short-term goals (within 5 years), keep funds in taxable accounts or cash equivalents.
   - For mid to long-term goals (e.g., retirement), focus on tax-advantaged accounts for growth.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   - Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and aligned with your risk appetite, regardless of the account type.
   - Consider placing high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your portfolio periodically and adjust allocations as necessary based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### 6. **Seek Professional Guidance:**
   - Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced distribution of your investments that align with your financial goals. Always consider your unique circumstances when making investment decisions.
