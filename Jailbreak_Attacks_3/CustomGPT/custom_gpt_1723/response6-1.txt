To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand Account Types and Their Benefits
- **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth; take advantage of any employer match.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Provides tax benefits; Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: More flexible access to funds; subject to capital gains tax on earnings.

### 2. Asset Allocation Strategy
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
- **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
  - **High Tax Bracket**: Prioritize pre-tax contributions to 401(k) and Traditional IRA to reduce taxable income.
  - **Lower Tax Bracket**: Max out Roth IRA contributions for tax-free growth.
- **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and reward.

### 3. Contribution Limits and Prioritization
- **401(k) Contributions**: Aim to max out contributions if possible (check the annual limits).
- **IRA Contributions**: Decide between Traditional and Roth based on your current and expected future tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility; invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. Regular Reevaluation and Rebalancing
- **Annual Review**: Regularly reassess your asset allocation based on changes in tax laws, income, and financial goals.
- **Rebalance Portfolio**: Adjust your investment mix periodically to maintain your desired risk level and capitalize on market shifts.

### Conclusion
Finding the optimal distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable account requires considering your current tax situation, future income expectations, and overall financial goals. By leveraging the unique benefits of each account type and adjusting your strategy as your financial situation evolves, you can optimize your retirement savings effectively.
