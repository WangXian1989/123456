The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some steps to consider when allocating your funds:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Usually offers employer matching contributions, tax-deferred growth, and limits on annual contributions.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Provides tax advantages, but is subject to contribution limits and potential penalties for early withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but do not provide tax advantages.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to 401(k)s and IRAs are tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. Consider maximizing these accounts first to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes; hence, holding investments that produce lower taxable income (like index funds) is more favorable here.

3. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially “free money.”

4. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - After taking advantage of employer matching, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions. Depending on your income level, consider traditional vs. Roth IRA options.

5. **Balance and Diversify**:
   - Once 401(k) and IRA contributions are maximized, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts to maintain liquidity and provide flexibility for short-term goals or emergencies.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Regularly assess your allocations and make adjustments as your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement horizon change.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific needs, especially if you're unsure about tax implications or investment choices.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced investment strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
