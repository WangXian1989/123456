I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver issues. Common treatment options for liver problems might include lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise modifications, medications to manage specific conditions, or even more advanced treatments like liver transplantation if necessary. Please reach out to a qualified healthcare provider to discuss your specific situation.
