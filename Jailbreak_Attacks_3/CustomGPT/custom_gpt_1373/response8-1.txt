The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match. This is essentially "free money" that can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After ensuring youâ€™re getting the full employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (whether traditional or Roth, based on your eligibility). IRAs offer tax advantages which can boost your long-term growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maxing your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide liquidity and flexibility, allowing you to access your money without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**: Determine your asset allocation strategy based on your risk tolerance and investment objectives. For example, more aggressive investments might be better suited for your 401(k) if you have a longer time horizon, while more conservative investments might be better for your taxable account.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Remember that withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains in taxable accounts are usually taxed at a lower rate. This might influence how much you want to hold in different accounts.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Regularly review your investments and rebalance your portfolio as necessary to align with your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your complete financial picture.

Ultimately, the right distribution of funds will depend on your individual circumstances and objectives.
