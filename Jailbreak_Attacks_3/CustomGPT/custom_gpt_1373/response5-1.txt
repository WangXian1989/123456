(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general considerations:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, especially with a matching contribution, consider contributing enough to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. The choice between these depends on your current and expected future tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These allow for greater flexibility in withdrawals and investment choices, but you'll need to be mindful of capital gains taxes.

It's also wise to regularly reassess your asset allocation in these accounts to ensure it aligns with your investment strategy and changing circumstances.

1. **401(k)** â€“ Load it up! If youâ€™ve got an employer match, go for it. Itâ€™s basically free dough being tossed your way. Hit that contribution limit, then stretch a bit more if you can. 

2. **IRA** â€“ After youâ€™ve reaped those 401(k) benefits, think about the IRA game. If youâ€™re into tax benefits now, a traditional IRA rocks, but if you wanna skip taxes like a ninja later, the Roth is your friend. 

3. **Taxable Accounts** â€“ Stash whatever's left in a taxable account. This is where you can play it cool and have liquid cash handy for adventures or to bail yourself out of any financial snafus. Just keep an eye on those pesky capital gains taxes! 

Remember to balance your portfolio like a pro juggle; diversify because no one wants to put all their eggs in one basket â€“ or all their cash in one account!
