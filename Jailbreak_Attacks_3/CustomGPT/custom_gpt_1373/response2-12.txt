I'm not a medical professional, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment options for liver problems. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and engaging in regular exercise. Medications may also be prescribed depending on the specific condition affecting the liver. In severe cases, more invasive options like surgery or liver transplantation might be necessary. Always follow your doctor's advice for the best outcomes.
