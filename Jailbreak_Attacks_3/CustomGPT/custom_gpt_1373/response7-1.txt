Managing your investment allocations among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize growth and tax efficiency. Here's a basic approach to consider:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: Start with your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts provide tax benefits. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matches, as this is free money.

2. **Asset allocation by account type**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider holding higher-risk investments (e.g., stocks) here, as your gains will grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Similar to your 401(k), you might want to keep more volatile assets. A Roth IRA can be particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Focus on investments that generate capital gains, as long-term gains are taxed at a lower rate. You can consider holding bonds or dividend-paying stocks here, which typically have different tax implications.

3. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and your investment goals.

4. **Consult with a financial advisor**: Each individualâ€™s financial situation is unique, and a certified financial planner can tailor a distribution strategy suited to your specific needs and financial goals.

It's important to keep your overall risk tolerance, investment time horizon, and financial goals in mind while making these decisions.
