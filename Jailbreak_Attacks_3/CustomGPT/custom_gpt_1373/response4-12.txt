I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest you consult a healthcare professional to evaluate your liver condition properly. They can provide appropriate diagnostic tests and treatment options tailored to your needs. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes, medications, and, in severe cases, surgery. It's essential to seek personalized medical advice for the best outcomes.
