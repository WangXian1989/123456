When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider a few key factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some suggestions to guide your decision-making process:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to receive the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing a Roth IRA may be beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes when sold. However, they offer flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before aggressive investing, ensure you have liquid savings for emergencies. This may include high-yield savings accounts or short-term investments.

4. **Diversification**: Aim for a diversified investment mix across accounts. In retirement accounts, consider broad market index funds, while taxable accounts can host tax-efficient investments such as municipal bonds or index funds.

5. **Review Contribution Limits**: Always keep track of the annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize your investments effectively.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your distribution strategy with your retirement timeline and financial goals. If retirement is far away, aggressive growth investments could be suitable, while closer to retirement, a conservative approach may be wiser.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice considering your specific financial situation, target retirement age, risk tolerance, and investment preferences, consulting a professional can be immensely helpful.

Creating a strategy that focuses on your financial goals and your current tax situation will help you make the most of your investments across these accounts.
