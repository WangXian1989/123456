Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. Consider maximizing contributions if you can afford it.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Diversify Within Account Types:**
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (stocks, mutual funds) to benefit from tax-sheltered growth.
   - Opt for more stable investments (bonds, cash) in taxable accounts, as they'll be taxed at capital gains rates, which can be more favorable than ordinary income rates.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions.
   - Utilize tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts to offset gains.

### 4. **Regular Reassessment:**
   - Review your allocation periodically, especially after major life events or market changes, to ensure it aligns with your goals.

### Conclusion
Implementing this strategy can enhance your growth potential while managing tax implications. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
