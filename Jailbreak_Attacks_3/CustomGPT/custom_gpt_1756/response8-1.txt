The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maxing out your employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and whether you expect to be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Continue with 401(k) Contributions**: If you still have funds available, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. The 401(k) typically offers tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts, you can invest additional funds in taxable accounts. Choose investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred. Keep lower-growth investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they tend to generate interest income that can be taxed at a higher rate.

6. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure you have a diversified investment portfolio to manage risks.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.
