It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver problems. However, common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and high-fat foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help manage weight and improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Prescribed based on the specific liver condition (e.g., antiviral medications for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function and detect any progression of disease.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options or liver transplants might be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: Some may use vitamin E or milk thistle, but always consult with a doctor first.

Make sure to get a comprehensive evaluation by a hepatologist or your primary care doctor to determine the appropriate treatment plan tailored to your needs.
