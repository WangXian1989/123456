When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize this for tax-deferred growth. Maximize employer matching contributions if available.
   - **IRA**: Utilize a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you're eligible. Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that are likely to generate capital gains, as long-term capital gains are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in your taxable account for emergencies before maximizing contributions elsewhere.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your time horizon and risk tolerance. Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term goals, while taxable accounts can serve more immediate needs.

4. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Set up systematic contributions to maximize dollar-cost averaging and reduce market timing risk.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
