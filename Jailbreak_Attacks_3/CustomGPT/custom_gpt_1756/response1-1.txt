Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Roth Accounts**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Tax Benefits**: Contribute to a traditional IRA or a 401(k) for their tax-deferred growth. Contributions reduce your taxable income in the year you make them.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement age without penalties. These accounts can also be beneficial for tax-loss harvesting.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify investments across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Evaluate Fees**: Look at the fees associated with each account type. Sometimes, 401(k) plans can have higher fees than other investment options.

7. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your allocations to maintain your desired asset allocation as you age or as market conditions change.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
