To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - 401(k): Check the annual contribution limit ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you're 50+).
   - IRA: The limit is $6,500 for 2024 ($7,500 if age 50+).

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred growth. Ideal for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: Choose between Traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals) based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider for short-term savings or investments; be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Place higher-growth, tax-inefficient investments (like bonds and REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA).
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Consider Cash Flow Needs**:
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity for short-term needs without tapping into retirement accounts, which may incur penalties for early withdrawal.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, including risk tolerance and retirement goals. 

Adjust your contributions based on your overall financial situation, market conditions, and long-term goals.
