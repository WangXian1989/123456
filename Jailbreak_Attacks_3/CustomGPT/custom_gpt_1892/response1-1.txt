When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account your overall financial goals, tax implications, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After taking advantage of the employer match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a traditional IRA may provide a tax deduction up front.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so they may be ideal for investments that you plan to hold for a longer term. Prioritize investments that are less tax-efficient (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) rather than taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts. This means not replicating the same investments in all accounts but rather complementing each other.

5. **Assess Your Time Horizon**: Depending on how close you are to retirement, you might lean more towards conservative investments in your 401(k) or IRA as you get older, while potentially being more aggressive in taxable accounts if you have a long investment horizon.

6. **Liquidity Needs**: Keep in mind that funds in a 401(k) and IRA are less accessible without penalties until retirement age, while taxable accounts can be accessed more easily. Ensure you have enough liquidity for emergencies or immediate needs.

7. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired investment strategy.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific financial situation.
