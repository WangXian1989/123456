When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider fully funding an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation) because these accounts also offer tax advantages.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before putting more money into investments, consider paying off any high-interest debt. The guaranteed return of paying off debt can often exceed investment returns.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a readily accessible account (like a savings account) that covers 3-6 months of expenses before heavily investing.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Determine your desired asset allocation (e.g., stocks vs. bonds) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. You can adjust the allocation across your accounts depending on the type of investments available in each account.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider the tax implications of each account type:
   - **Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Best for high-growth investments since you won't pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Good for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal for long-term growth since withdrawals are tax-free if certain conditions are met.

6. **Monitor and Rebalance**: Regularly review your investments to ensure they align with your goals and reallocate as needed.

Keep in mind tax laws and financial situations can vary, so it's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
