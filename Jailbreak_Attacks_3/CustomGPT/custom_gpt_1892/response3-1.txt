The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. Here's a framework to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often employer-sponsored, may come with matching contributions. It's tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on contributions or earnings until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages for retirement savings. Types include Traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are regular investment accounts where you pay taxes on dividends and capital gains annually. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals but come with tax liabilities.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in place. This protects your investments from being liquidated in a financial emergency.

3. **Contribute to 401(k) First**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money." 

4. **Maximize IRA Contributions**: After securing the employer match, consider maximizing your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which provides tax-free growth.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Keep stocks in taxable accounts, especially those you expect to hold long-term, to benefit from lower capital gains tax when sold after a year.

6. **Assess Your Risk Tolerance**: The allocation among accounts can vary based on whether you're more conservative or aggressive.
   - If you're younger and can afford more risk, consider a higher allocation in stocks.
   - Nearing retirement typically suggests shifting towards bonds or more stable investments, especially in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Diversify Your Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes to reduce risk.

8. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Financial needs and market conditions change. Review your investments annually or after significant life changes to ensure they align with your goals.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain, consider working with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

By strategically distributing funds across these accounts based on your unique goals and circumstances, you can optimize your investment growth and tax efficiency over time.
