When considering the best way to distribute your money among different types of investment accounts—specifically your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts—here are some strategic steps to follow:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, try to max out contributions (up to $22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, whereas Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals (up to $6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in lower-turnover funds or tax-efficient investments here since capital gains and interest income will be taxable. Utilize tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

3. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Spread out investments across accounts to take advantage of different tax treatments. For example, you might hold bonds in your tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable interest.

4. **Consider Your Financial Goals and Timeline**:
   - Assess your short-term vs. long-term goals. If you need access to funds in the near future, keep that in the taxable accounts. For retirement, lean more on tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Periodic Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly revisit your allocation to ensure that it aligns with your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

6. **Seek Professional Guidance**:
   - If needed, consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your full financial picture.

By following these strategies, you'll be in a better position to effectively manage your investments while optimizing for tax efficiency.
