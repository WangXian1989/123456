I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional to discuss your liver problem and get personalized treatment options. It's essential to have a proper diagnosis and individualized care plan. Common treatment options for liver problems can include lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, surgical interventions, depending on the specific condition. Please make sure to consult with a medical expert for the best advice.
