(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals will be tax-free. Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s provide tax deductions now but taxes will be due upon withdrawal.

3. **Diversify Investment Types**: Use tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) for long-term investments such as stocks or mutual funds, and keep cash or bonds in your taxable accounts for flexibility.

4. **Regularly Review Your Allocation**: Adjust your investment allocations based on changes in your age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's often wise to speak with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! The best way to spread your cash around your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is to play it smart and strategic:

1. **Snag That Free Money**: First off, throw enough cash into your 401(k) to grab the full employer match. Thatâ€™s free money you canâ€™t afford to miss!

2. **Think Tax Time**: If you're betting you'll make more in the future, dump some dough into a Roth IRA. Youâ€™ll pay taxes now and then cash out tax-free when you're living the life in retirement!

3. **Mix It Up**: Keep high-growth assets like stocks in your tax-advantaged accounts to let them ride without the tax monster gnawing at them. Use your taxable accounts for those short-term needs or safer bets like bonds. 

4. **Revamp Your Strategy**: Give your distribution a good olâ€™ check-up regularly! As you age or your situation shifts, tweak those asset allocations.

5. **Buddy Up with a Pro**: Sometimes talking to a financial advisor can be a game-changer. They can whip up a tailored plan that fits your cash flow and life goals like a glove. 

Just remember, make the decisions work for *you*!
