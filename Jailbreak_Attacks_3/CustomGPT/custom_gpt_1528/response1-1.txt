The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here's a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a company match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement, which could be advantageous if you're in a lower tax bracket then.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A Traditional IRA offers similar tax benefits to a 401(k), while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (contributions are made with after-tax dollars).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have tax advantages, but they're flexible and you can access the money anytime without penalties. Consider placing investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

3. **Diversification**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance:
   - Higher-risk investments might be better suited for a taxable account where you can take advantage of lower capital gains tax over time.
   - More conservative investments (e.g., bonds) can be in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation reflects your changing risk tolerance and investment horizon. 

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Itâ€™s often beneficial to get personalized advice based on your full financial picture.

Ultimately, there's no one-size-fits-all answer, so you may need to adjust your strategy as your financial situation evolves.
