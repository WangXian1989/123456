I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver problems. Treatment options may vary based on the specific condition you're dealing with. Common approaches could include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or more specific treatments depending on the liver disease. Always seek the guidance of a medical professional for the best care.
