When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies for optimal asset allocation:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, such as your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits, whether it's tax deferral or tax-free growth, which can significantly enhance your long-term returns.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

3. **Debt and Immediate Needs**: If you have high-interest debt (like credit card debt), it might be wise to pay that down before heavily investing in retirement accounts. Additionally, ensure you have an emergency fund for immediate financial needs.

4. **Flexible Contributions**: Allocate funds to your taxable accounts after maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investments, making them ideal for shorter-term needs.

5. **Diversified Investments**: Keep your investment diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all three account types according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Different accounts can serve different purposes in your investment strategy.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio across all account types periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance.

7. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: As you approach retirement, consider how and when you will withdraw funds from each account to optimize tax efficiency and sustain your retirement income.

Working with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies based on your personal financial situation and goals.
