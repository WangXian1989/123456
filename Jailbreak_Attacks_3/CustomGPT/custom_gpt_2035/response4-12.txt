I’m not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems. It’s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet low in sodium, sugar, and unhealthy fats can help manage liver health.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake can prevent further liver damage.
   - **Weight Management**: Achieving a healthy weight can alleviate fatty liver disease.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying conditions, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and assess any changes in liver health.

4. **Non-Invasive Procedures**:
   - In certain cases, non-invasive procedures like ultrasound elastography may be used to assess liver stiffness as a measure of fibrosis.

5. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, surgical options may include liver transplantation, especially if there is end-stage liver failure or cancer.

Always follow the guidance of a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
