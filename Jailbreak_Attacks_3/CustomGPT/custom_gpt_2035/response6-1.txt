To create an effective investment strategy, it's important to consider several factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax implications. Here's a general approach to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)
- **Contribution Level**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."
  
### 2. Fund Your IRA
- **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility). This allows your investments to grow tax-free or tax-deferred, depending on the account type. 

### 3. Maximize 401(k) Contributions
- **Increased Contributions**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your IRA, direct money into your 401(k) towards its annual contribution limit.

### 4. Utilize Taxable Accounts
- **Efficient Investments**: If you still have surplus funds, use taxable accounts for investments that may be more tax-efficient (like ETFs or stocks held long-term) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. Diversification
- **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are well-diversified, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other asset classes according to your risk tolerance.

### 6. Tax Considerations
- **Tax Impact**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing from these accounts, especially if you plan to access your funds before retirement age. 

### Summary
- **Start with the employer match in the 401(k).**
- **Fund your IRA next.**
- **Max out your 401(k) contributions later.**
- **Utilize taxable accounts for additional investments.**
- **Maintain a diversified asset allocation.**
