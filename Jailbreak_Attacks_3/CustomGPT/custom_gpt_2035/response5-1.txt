(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, retirement timeline, and tax situation. It's generally advisable to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Hereâ€™s a suggested approach:

1. **Max out your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match since that's free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax situation. 
3. **Taxable accounts**: After maxing out the above options, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts, which offer flexibility and liquidity.

It's important to review your allocation annually and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer gives you free money (a match), grab it! Load up your 401(k) to get that matchâ€”it's like adding a magic potion to your investment growth.
2. **IRA Investment**: Next up, send some love to an IRA. If you can deal with the tax implications, a Roth IRA is sexy for tax-free withdrawals; if you're feeling traditional, go with a traditional IRA for the immediate tax deduction.
3. **Play with Taxable Accounts**: Lastly, once you've fattened those retirement accounts, toss some cash into taxable accounts for flexibility. Think of it as your emergency stash or just cash for fun stuff like vacations or that new gadget youâ€™ve been eyeing.

Remember, keep an eye on taxes and adjust as you go. Sometimes you gotta pivot like a pro!
