Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), consider contributing enough to get the full match before putting money into an IRA or taxable accounts, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. However, you'll pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k) for tax purposes, but check income limits for deductibility.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after taxes, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income (like dividends and capital gains) is taxed in the year itâ€™s realized. Use these accounts for investments that generate lower taxes or to access funds without penalties.

3. **Diversification Strategy**: Aim for a well-diversified portfolio that balances risk and reward. Place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to take advantage of tax-free growth for as long as possible.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you will access funds in retirement. You might want to draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

5. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have enough liquid savings outside these accounts before investing heavily in them.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review your asset allocation according to financial market changes and life circumstances.

It's a complex decision, so consulting a financial advisor can be beneficial to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
