I'm not a doctor, but if you're having liver problems, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan. However, general treatment options for liver issues might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes adopting a healthier diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe antiviral or other medications.
3. **Supplements**: Some individuals benefit from vitamins or supplements, but you should only take these under the guidance of a healthcare provider.
4. **Monitoring and Regular Check-Ups**: Keeping track of liver function through regular blood tests.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases or for specific conditions, surgical options may be considered, including liver transplantation.

Always seek professional medical advice to find the best treatment for your specific situation.
