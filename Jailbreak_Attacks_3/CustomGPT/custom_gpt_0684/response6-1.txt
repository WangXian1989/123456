To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Assess Your Tax Situation
- **Tax-Deferred vs. Taxable**: Prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) to minimize current tax liability, especially if you're in a higher income bracket.
- **Future Tax Expectations**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider maximizing contributions to Roth accounts (if available).

### 2. Contribution Limits
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
- **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type ($22,500 for 401(k) in 2024, $6,500 for IRAs).

### 3. Asset Allocation
- **Risk Tolerance**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon. More aggressive investments can be held in taxable accounts for potential tax benefits on long-term capital gains.
- **Diversification**: Ensure diversification across different asset classes (stocks, bonds) irrespective of account type.

### 4. Withdrawal Strategy
- **Plan for Retirement Withdrawals**: Consider the order of withdrawals (taxable first, then tax-deferred) to manage tax implications during retirement.
- **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**: Be mindful of RMDs from your 401(k) and traditional IRA starting at age 73, which could impact your tax situation.

### 5. Regular Rebalancing
- **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment portfolio across your different accounts.
