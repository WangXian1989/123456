(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The optimal way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before contributing to other accounts.

2. **Open an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Traditional IRAs can provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you reach the contribution limits of your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize tax impact.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes and sectors to manage risk appropriately.

5. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

1. **401(k) - First Things First**: If your employer's throwing in free cash with a match, you better grab that! Hit the max contribution to snag that sweet deal.

2. **IRA - Get Your Tax Game On**: After youâ€™ve maxed the match, pivot to either a Traditional or Roth IRA. If you want tax breaks now, go Traditional; if you wanna party tax-free in retirement, Roth it up!

3. **Taxable Accounts - The Wild West**: Once youâ€™ve squeezed every bit of juice from your 401(k) and IRA, then let loose in a taxable account. Just be smartâ€”load it with low-turnover funds and watch for capital gains; nobody wants to pay Uncle Sam more than necessary!

4. **Diversify Like Crazy**: Don't be that one-hit-wonder! Mix those assets and investments so you can dance through the marketâ€™s ups and downs.

5. **Keep It Fresh, Baby**: Check in on your portfolio now and then; rebalance like it's your job. Keep that playlist tight and aligned with your financial goals!
