Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, start by maxing that out, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts are taxed on dividends and capital gains. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep your asset allocation in check across all accounts to ensure you maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

5. **Consider Time Horizon**: Money needed for short-term goals should be kept in liquid, lower-risk investments, while funds for long-term growth can be allocated more aggressively.

6. **Take Advantage of Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs before funding taxable accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

Itâ€™s also wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the distribution strategy to your specific circumstances.
