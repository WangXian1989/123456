To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are taxed annually (capital gains tax), but you have flexibility in how and when you withdraw funds.

### 2. **Determine Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - For retirement funding, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) first since they offer greater long-term benefits due to tax deferral or exemption.
   - For short-term goals, consider maximizing contributions to your taxable accounts.

### 3. **Utilize Employer Match**
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to receive the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

### 4. **Consider Your Risk Tolerance**
   - Allocate assets based on your risk tolerance. Generally, equities may be suitable for long-term growth in tax-deferred accounts, while fixed income could be placed in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 5. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. This could mean holding a balanced portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other assets regardless of the account type.

### 6. **Annual Contributions**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA if possible. For 2024, the limits are typically higher than those for taxable accounts, providing more room for growth.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match + 10% of your salary.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum limit ($6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
- **Taxable Account**: Allocate any remaining funds considering liquidity needs and tax implications.

### Conclusion
Balance your contributions based on your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Regularly review and adjust your allocation as your circumstances change.
