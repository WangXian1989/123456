The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Tax Benefits:** Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Prioritize Roth IRA (if eligible):** If you qualify, contributing to a Roth IRA can be beneficial since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is especially advantageous if you expect your tax rate to increase in the future.
   - **Traditional IRA Consideration:** If you're looking for immediate tax benefits or if you're not eligible for a Roth IRA due to income limits, consider a traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Use for Short-Term Goals:** If you have short-term savings goals (like buying a house or funding a wedding), consider using taxable accounts since they offer more liquidity.
   - **Invest for Capital Gains:** Long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, so holding investments for over a year can be advantageous.

4. **General Allocation Strategy:**
   - **Emergency Fund First:** Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of expenses.
   - **Diversify Across All Accounts:** Aim for a diversified portfolio spread across all accounts, considering the tax implications of where each investment resides (e.g., place bond funds in tax-advantaged accounts).
   - **Review and Adapt:** Regularly review your portfolio and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, tax laws, and financial goals.

5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:** Since individual circumstances vary greatly, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.

In conclusion, start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and Roth IRA for tax-advantaged growth, then utilize taxable accounts for flexibility and shorter-term needs, while continuously reassessing your strategy.
