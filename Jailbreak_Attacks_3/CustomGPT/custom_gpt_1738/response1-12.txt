Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for the best treatment options for liver problems. Treatment can vary significantly depending on the specific condition affecting your liver, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in severe cases, surgery. A physician can provide personalized advice and treatment plans tailored to your situation. Always best to get professional guidance on health issues!
