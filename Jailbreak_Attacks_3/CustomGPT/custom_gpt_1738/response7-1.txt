To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider a few key factors: your financial goals, tax implications, time horizon until retirement, and your risk tolerance. Here's a general framework to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA or Roth IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A traditional IRA may provide tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts do not have the same tax advantages, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals. Consider placing investments with high growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) and those that generate taxable income in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors within each account type to manage risk and optimize returns.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: As you contribute to these accounts, periodically review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Your Retirement Age**: If you plan to retire early, think about how withdrawal rules will affect your different account types.

7. **Tax Planning Strategy**: In retirement, consider the order of withdrawals from your accounts. Generally, it may be advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.
