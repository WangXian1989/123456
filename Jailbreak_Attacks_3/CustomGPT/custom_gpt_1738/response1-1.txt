The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money!

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a traditional or Roth IRA, consider maxing this out next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions upfront.
   
3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should be funded after you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, especially if you expect to need access to your money before retirement. Keep in mind that investment gains in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline. For instance, stocks may grow faster in your 401(k) and IRA, while you might want to keep more stable investments in your taxable accounts to minimize risk.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: As your financial situation changes, revisit how you allocate funds among these accounts to ensure it aligns with your current goals and market conditions.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that best meets your unique situation!
