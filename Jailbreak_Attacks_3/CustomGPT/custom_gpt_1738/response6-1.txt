To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to at least contribute the minimum required to receive the full match.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your current tax situation and future expectations. If you're eligible, a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it an excellent long-term investment.

2. **Balance with Taxable Accounts:**
   - Once you've maximized contributions to the tax-advantaged accounts, direct additional funds into a taxable brokerage account. This account provides flexibility since you can access your funds anytime without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on earnings.

3. **Consider Asset Location:**
   - Place high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for income-producing assets (like bonds or dividend stocks) that might incur taxes in a more favorable manner.

4. **Diversify and Reassess Regularly:**
   - Diversification across different asset classes within each account type is crucial for reducing risk.
   - Regularly analyze your allocation, adjusting as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions change.

In summary, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts before considering taxable investments and ensure a well-balanced, diversified portfolio across all account types.
