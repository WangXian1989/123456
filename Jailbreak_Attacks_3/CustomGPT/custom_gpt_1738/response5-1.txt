(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to contribute enough to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you can choose between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA, depending on whether you want to pay taxes now or later.

After securing your retirement accounts, you can allocate funds to your taxable accounts. This could be beneficial for short-term goals or if you've already reached your limits in tax-advantaged accounts. It's essential to diversify your investments across all three account types to optimize your tax efficiency and long-term growth. Consulting with a financial advisor is also recommended for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
