When considering how to effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to maximize your tax efficiency and retirement savings:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit (e.g., $22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're over 50). This will reduce your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA as well (e.g., $6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50). Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and whether you have a workplace retirement plan.
   
3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This gives you access to your money without penalties and can also allow for more flexible investment choices.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you’re in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower one during retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA). If you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, consider Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) for tax-free withdrawals later.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, stock investments typically offer higher growth potential but come with higher risk.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust as necessary. Life changes, market conditions, and new financial goals can impact your distribution strategy.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Depending on your financial situation, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your goals and circumstances.

By considering these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Always ensure your decisions align with your long-term financial goals.
