Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here's a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Both accounts offer tax advantages. Contributions may be tax-deductible, and your investments grow tax-deferred. If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts donâ€™t have the same tax advantages, but they offer flexibility. Capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they're realized.

3. **Diversification Strategy**: Ensure your investment strategy is diversified across all accounts. Different types of accounts might hold different types of investments (e.g., stocks, bonds).

4. **Emergency Fund First**: Make sure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts. Typically, 3 to 6 months of expenses is recommended.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might lean more towards aggressive growth in a 401(k) and IRA, while older investors may prioritize preservation of capital in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your allocation and rebalance as necessary based on performance, changes in your risk tolerance, or changes in your financial situation.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your individual circumstances. They can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial picture.
