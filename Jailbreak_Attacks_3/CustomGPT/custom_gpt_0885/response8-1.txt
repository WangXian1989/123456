When it comes to distributing money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to consider several factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here’s a simple breakdown to guide you:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - Maximize employer match: Contribute enough to get any available employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Contribution limits: Ensure you’re aware of the contribution limits for 401(k) plans, which can change annually.

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional or Roth):**
   - Tax implications: If you're looking for tax-deductible contributions, consider a Traditional IRA. If you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial.
   - Contribution limits: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for IRAs as well.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Flexibility: Taxable accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility compared to retirement accounts but be aware of capital gains taxes when selling investments.
   - Diversification: Consider using taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they may be taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Overall Distribution Strategy:**
   - Prioritize: Focus on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first, then allocate to taxable accounts as needed.
   - Diversification: Ensure a good mix of investments across all accounts to mitigate risk.
   - Regular review: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and any life changes.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your individual situation.
