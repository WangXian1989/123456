Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach you can consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Choose to contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money".
   - **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Diversifying Between Accounts**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These can provide flexibility for short-term needs and do not have contribution limits. Investments here could focus on:
     - Stocks, which may benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax when held over a year.
     - Municipal bonds, which can be tax-exempt.
   - **Asset Location Strategy:** Place higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, and use taxable accounts for more stable, income-generating investments to optimize taxation.

### Summary
- **Prioritize contributions to 401(k) and IRA** before taxable accounts for tax benefits.
- **Consider your investment horizon:** Short-term vs. long-term growth can dictate where to allocate funds effectively.
