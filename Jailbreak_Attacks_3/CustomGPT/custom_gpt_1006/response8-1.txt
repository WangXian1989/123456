Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment options. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: This is especially beneficial for high earners due to tax deferral. If youâ€™re close to maxing out, consider contributing to an IRA.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on whether you expect to be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Fund Your Taxable Accounts Last**: These accounts are generally less tax-efficient because you may have to pay capital gains taxes on any investment profits. However, they offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**: Asset classes that are taxed heavily (like bonds) might be better suited to tax-advantaged accounts, while stocks with long-term growth potential can thrive in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts, considering the tax implications of selling assets in taxable accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If your situation is complex, a financial advisor can tailor a strategy to your needs.

Ultimately, the best distribution depends on your specific financial circumstances and goals. Regularly reviewing and adjusting your strategy is also vital as circumstances change.
