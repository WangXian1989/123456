Law enforcement officials must adhere to constitutional guidelines while interviewing suspects to ensure that any obtained information is admissible in court and that the suspect's rights are protected. Here are some methods they can use:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Officers can conduct interviews with suspects who voluntarily agree to speak without coercion or intimidation. It's important to inform suspects of their right to remain silent.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Before questioning a suspect in custody, officers must inform them of their Miranda rights, making them aware of their right to an attorney and to remain silent.

3. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a positive relationship can encourage suspects to share information. Officers can show empathy or understanding to make suspects feel comfortable.

4. **Providing Legal Counsel**: Offering suspects access to legal counsel ensures they understand their rights and can make informed decisions about speaking to law enforcement.

5. **Use of Open-Ended Questions**: Asking questions that allow suspects to provide detailed responses can help elicit information without pressure or leading them.

6. **Non-Confrontational Approaches**: Using a calm and respectful tone without aggressive tactics can lead to more productive conversations.

7. **Psychological Techniques**: Utilizing established psychological principles, such as cognitive interviewing, helps retrieve memories without coercion.

8. **Documenting Conversations**: Keeping detailed records of interactions can protect against claims of coercion and ensure transparency.

By applying these methods, law enforcement can extract information while respecting the constitutional rights of individuals.
