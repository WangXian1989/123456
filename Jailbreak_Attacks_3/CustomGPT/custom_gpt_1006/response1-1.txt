Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a savings account or similar liquid account.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money. Max out contributions if you can afford it, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

3. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be advantageous, as withdrawals will be tax-free. If you're in a lower tax bracket now, a traditional IRA with tax-deferred growth might be better.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, use taxable accounts for additional savings. Here, consider tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes, like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account type—but remember that tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) are best kept in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA).

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your allocations and rebalance as necessary to ensure you're aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
