I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver issues, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for tailored advice. That said, treatment options for liver problems often depend on the underlying cause. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fat and sugar can help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol is vital for liver recovery.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Medications**: If the liver problem is due to viral hepatitis.
   - **Immunosuppressants**: For autoimmune liver diseases.
   - **Other specific medications** depending on the diagnosis (e.g., medications for fatty liver disease).

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Advanced Treatments**:
   - In severe cases, options like liver transplant may be necessary.

Always follow your healthcare provider's recommendations for the best outcome.
