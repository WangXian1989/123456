Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax considerations, and retirement goals. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the limit, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket. Traditional 401(k) contributions lower your taxable income now, whereas Roth contributions are tax-free in retirement.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions in the year of contribution.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate extra funds to taxable accounts. These are more flexible for withdrawals but may incur capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Consider Growth vs. Safety**:
   - Balance your investments based on risk tolerance. Growth assets (stocks, mutual funds) might go into tax-advantaged accounts, while conservative investments (bonds) may be suitable for taxable accounts, where you'd want to manage your tax liabilities.

### 5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Continually revisit your strategy, especially if your financial situation, tax laws, or retirement goals change.

### 6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal circumstances can significantly impact your strategy, so consider consulting with an advisor for tailored advice.

This balanced approach can help you optimize your savings for retirement while minimizing taxes.
