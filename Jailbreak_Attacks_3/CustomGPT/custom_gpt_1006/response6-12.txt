I can't provide medical advice, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options tailored to your liver condition. They may suggest:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet: Emphasize fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; reduce fats and sugars.
   - Avoid alcohol: It can worsen liver damage.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying conditions.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor your condition.

4. **Advanced Treatments**:
   - For severe cases, treatments like liver transplant may be considered.

It's crucial to work closely with a healthcare professional to determine the best approach for your situation.
