Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and overall financial strategy. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match**: Aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax Contributions**: Contributions lower your taxable income, making this a strategic choice if you're in a higher tax bracket now.

### 2. **Traditional IRA**
   - **Tax Deduction**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, allowing you to reduce your taxable income.
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Typically more investment options than a 401(k), which can help diversify your portfolio.

### 3. **Roth IRA**
   - **Tax-Free Growth**: Contributions are made after taxes, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **No RMDs**: Unlike traditional accounts, there are no required minimum distributions during your lifetime.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts provide access to funds without penalties, making them ideal for short-term goals.
   - **Capital Gains Considerations**: Be aware of long-term vs. short-term capital gains taxes when selling investments.

### **Recommended Distribution Strategy**
1. **Maximize 401(k) contributions** to take advantage of employer matching.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).
3. **Invest extra funds in taxable accounts** for flexibility and liquidity.

### **Final Tips**
- Regularly review your asset allocation based on market conditions and personal goals.
- Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your specific situation.
