When considering how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some key factors to evaluate:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for higher-income earners looking to lower their tax bill.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While they donâ€™t offer immediate tax advantages, they provide flexibility in accessing funds and may have capital gains tax advantages if investments are held long term.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if 50 or older). Knowing these limits will help manage your distribution effectively.

3. **Consider Your Financial Goals**:
   - Decide if your priority is immediate tax savings, long-term growth, or liquidity. Allocating funds according to your retirement timeline can also dictate how you should distribute your investments. 

### Recommended Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match; this is essentially free money.
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA. 
- **Fund Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for savings beyond your tax-advantaged contributions or for short-term goals. Keep in mind that capital gains and dividend taxes apply.

### Sample Distribution Approach:
- **401(k)**: 15%-20% of your income until you hit the employer match limit.
- **IRA**: 10%-15% aimed at maxing contribution limits.
- **Taxable**: Remainder of savings for flexibility and emergency needs or long-term investments.

By balancing your investments across these account types based on your financial situation and goals, you can optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
