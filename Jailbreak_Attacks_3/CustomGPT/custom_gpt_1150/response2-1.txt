It's important to consider several factors when determining how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but youâ€™ll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, it might be wise to focus on paying that down before maxing out retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Options**: Review the investment choices in your 401(k). If they are limited or have high fees, it may be better to contribute more to an IRA or taxable account.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

6. **Diversification**: Balance your investments across different account types to manage tax implications efficiently.

7. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your contributions with your financial goals and retirement timeline.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances and goals.
