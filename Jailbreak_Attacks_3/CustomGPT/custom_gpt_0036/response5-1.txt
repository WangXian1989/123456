When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. They offer benefits like tax deferrals and potential tax-free growth (with a Roth IRA).

3. **Debt Consideration**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that off before maximizing retirement contributions.

4. **Income Tax Bracket**: Determine your current and expected future tax brackets. If you anticipate being in a higher bracket later, prioritize Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) for later tax-free withdrawals.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for greater flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes, considering your risk tolerance and time horizon.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and life circumstances.

Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your unique situation.
