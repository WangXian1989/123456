Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions.

2. **Assess Your Tax Position**:
   - Taxable accounts generate capital gains; hold investments for over a year for lower capital gains tax rates.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

3. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
   - Keep high-growth or high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses in a liquid account separate from your investments.

5. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance periodically based on your risk tolerance and life changes.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.
