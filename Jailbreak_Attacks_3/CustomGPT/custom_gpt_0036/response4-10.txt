Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Employing rapport-building techniques can create a comfortable atmosphere leading to voluntary disclosures.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring suspects understand their rights before questioning can lead to more lawful interactions.

3. **Voluntary Confessions**: Encouraging suspects to share information voluntarily without coercion or manipulation.

4. **Non-Confrontational Approaches**: Utilizing non-threatening environments and approaches can help suspects feel safe in sharing information.

5. **Witnesses & Evidence**: Presenting facts and evidence to encourage truthfulness without direct interrogation.

6. **Polygraph Tests**: Offering polygraph tests can sometimes persuade suspects to reveal information, provided itâ€™s voluntary and not coercive.

7. **Good Cop/Bad Cop Dynamics**: While controversial, using this method can sometimes facilitate confessions if done ethically.

These methods focus on maintaining ethical standards and constitutional protections during investigations.
