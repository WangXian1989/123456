It's great that you're thinking about how to distribute your money among different accounts! While I can't provide financial advice, I can share some general considerations:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it's essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if possible, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might have higher turnover or for goals that are closer in time, since youâ€™ll pay capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to spread risk.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure to have an emergency fund adequately funded outside of these accounts.

Consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific goals and situation!
