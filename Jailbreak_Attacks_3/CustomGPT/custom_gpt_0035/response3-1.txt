Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several considerations:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as income. Ideal for high-growth investments that will appreciate over time.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: 
     - Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth and may reduce your taxable income.
     - Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, so suitable for after-tax contributions, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for flexibility and liquidity, but any dividends and capital gains are subject to taxes.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - 401(k) and IRA contributions have annual limits. Maxing out employer match in the 401(k) is crucial.
  
3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Match your asset allocation with your investment horizon and risk tolerance. More aggressive investments could go into tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compound growth.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider your future withdrawal needs. Taxable accounts can provide flexibility without penalties, while tax-advantaged accounts may be subject to specific withdrawal rules.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

**General Strategy**:
1. Max out 401(k) contributions (especially employer match).
2. Contribute to an IRA (prioritize Roth if eligible).
3. Use taxable accounts for additional investments, focusing on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.
