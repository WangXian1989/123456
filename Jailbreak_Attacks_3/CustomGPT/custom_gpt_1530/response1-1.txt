When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors for a well-balanced approach:

1. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that first. It’s essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax Diversification**: Max out your tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) and IRA) first:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to get the employer match, then consider the contribution limit for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
   
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest here after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. This allows flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, and you can invest in more liquid assets.

4. **Investment Goals**: Align your investments in each account type with your financial goals, timeframe, and risk tolerance. Long-term goals might favor stocks, while short-term needs might warrant more bonds or cash.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial situations.
