When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially "free money." The contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider maxing out contributions to an IRA once you've secured your employer match. A Roth IRA is ideal if you expect your taxes to be higher in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts if you've already maxed out retirement account contributions. Here, consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

**General Order of Operations**:
1. Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
2. Max out your IRA contributions (choose Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation).
3. Return to your 401(k) and increase contributions to the maximum allowed.
4. Any additional savings can go into a taxable account.

### Factors to Consider:
- **Tax Bracket**: Choose accounts based on your current vs. future tax brackets.
- **Investment Goals**: Align your account choices with your short-term and long-term goals.
- **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Remember that tax-deferred accounts have penalties for early withdrawal.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor the strategy to your specific financial situation and retirement goals.
