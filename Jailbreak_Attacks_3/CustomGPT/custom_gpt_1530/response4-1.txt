Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money." The contribution limit is higher than that for IRAs, so consider maxing this out if you can.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income, you can choose between a traditional IRA (which may offer tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, you might consider investing in a taxable account. This is flexible, with no contribution limits, but be aware of capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

4. **Balancing Investment Types**: Think about the types of investments in each account. Typically, you want to place higher growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable income-producing investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow or your goals change, periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure that it aligns with your financial objectives.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
