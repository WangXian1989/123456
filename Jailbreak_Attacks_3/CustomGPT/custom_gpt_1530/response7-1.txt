Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match if available, as it's essentially free money. This account offers tax-deferred growth, meaning you don't pay taxes until you withdraw funds.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. While you won't receive the same tax benefits, you have more flexibility in withdrawals and investments.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your individual situation and goals.
