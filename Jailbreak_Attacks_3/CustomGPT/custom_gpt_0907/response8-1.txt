Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Why?** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to IRAs**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Tax-deductible contributions and tax-deferred growth. Consider if you believe your tax rate will be lower in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. A good option if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Maximize Contributions**
   - Aim to reach annual contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA accounts. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 (plus a $7,500 catch-up if you're 50 or older) for 401(k)s and $6,500 (plus a $1,000 catch-up) for IRAs.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer flexibility in withdrawals and investment choices but come with capital gains taxes on profits when sold.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance, age, and goals. Stocks generally offer higher returns but come with higher risk compared to bonds. Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

### 6. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Focus on bonds and real estate in these accounts to minimize taxes when you withdraw.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Prefer stocks that have lower turnover and qualify for long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Over time, your asset allocation may drift. Review your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your investment strategy.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A financial advisor can tailor a strategy that’s specific to your financial situation and goals.

### Summary
Prioritize employer matches, maximize IRA contributions, and use taxable accounts for additional flexibility. Focus on tax efficiency and asset allocation to optimize returns.
