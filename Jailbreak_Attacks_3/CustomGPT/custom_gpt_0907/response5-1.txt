Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can enhance your retirement savings and optimize your tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deferral.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are best for investments that generate taxable income (like bonds) or for holding assets you might want to sell before retirement. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, so holding investments like stocks here can be beneficial.
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Withdrawals from these accounts are taxed as ordinary income, so consider the future tax implications of where you invest.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to spread risk.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Younger investors might lean more towards stocks for growth in their 401(k) and IRA, while older investors may want a more conservative approach.

### 5. **Review and Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your allocations and make adjustments based on performance and any changes in your financial situation or goals.

### 6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider working with a professional who can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a well-rounded approach to managing your retirement savings across different account types.
