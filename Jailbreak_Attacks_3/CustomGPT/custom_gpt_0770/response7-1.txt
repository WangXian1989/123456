The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, tax circumstances, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider for optimizing your asset allocation:

1. **Prioritize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before investing in other accounts; this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, such as IRAs and HSAs if eligible, as these accounts can provide immediate tax benefits (e.g., tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals).

3. **Roth vs. Traditional Accounts**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider your tax bracket now versus expected tax rates in retirement. A Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, providing potential tax advantages if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Invest for Growth in Taxable Accounts**: For investments held in taxable accounts, consider holding investments that generate lower levels of taxable income (like index funds or growth stocks) to minimize tax liability. 

5. **Asset Location Strategy**: Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts and keep tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-deferred accounts to minimize taxes on income and capital gains.

6. **Balance Risk and Diversification**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure you stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of your withdrawals and distributions in retirement. Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize tax burdens.

9. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Personal finance can be complex, and a professional can tailor strategies specific to your situation.

Ultimately, regularly revisiting your strategy as financial circumstances and tax laws change is crucial to ensuring your retirement savings align with your overall goals.
