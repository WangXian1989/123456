When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to focus on your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some factors to consider:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts typically offer tax advantages that can help your investments grow more efficiently.
   - Consider employer matching contributions in your 401(k) as an immediate return on investment.

2. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   - Allocate assets based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy. For example, consider holding more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income, such as municipal bonds or long-term capital gains investments.

**Example Distribution Strategy:**
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match.
- Max out your IRA contributions if possible.
- Use any remaining funds to invest in taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your income, financial goals, and market conditions. 

**Final Note:** It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.
