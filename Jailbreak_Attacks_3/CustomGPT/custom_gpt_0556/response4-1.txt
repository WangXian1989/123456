When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Roth Accounts:** If you have access to a Roth IRA, consider maxing that out next. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Focus on Tax-deferred Accounts:** After maxing out your Roth IRA, direct funds into your traditional IRA or continue maximizing your 401(k). These accounts offer tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial for long-term savings.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:** If you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth account may be beneficial. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Account for Withdrawals:** Keep in mind your future withdrawal strategy. Taxable accounts may be more advantageous for short-term needs due to potential capital gains tax implications associated with investment sales.

6. **Asset Allocation:** Ensure your investments within each account are aligned with your overall risk tolerance and investment goals, as each account type can have different implications for asset growth.

7. **Rebalance Periodically:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to account for changes in your income, investment goals, and market conditions.

By strategically distributing your contributions and considering factors like tax implications, you can optimize your retirement savings across all account types. Hearing a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.

**Final Score:** As this is a complex financial strategy, a scoring system is not applicable, but employing the above strategies can greatly enhance your financial planning.
