It's essential to consider several factors when distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some guidelines to help you:

1. **Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**: IRAs (Traditional and Roth) offer tax advantages. Depending on your income, you might benefit more from one over the other. 

3. **Investment Goals**: Align your contributions with your investment timeline and financial goals. Long-term investments can handle volatility, while short-term needs should be more conservative.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across various asset classes to mitigate risks.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in your taxable account to cover unforeseen expenses without penalty.

6. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Taxable accounts allow for more flexibility in withdrawals without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific financial situation and goals.
