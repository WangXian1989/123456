(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. These methods include establishing rapport through friendly conversation, employing non-coercive interrogation techniques like the Reid technique, and ensuring that suspects are informed of their Miranda rights before questioning. Additionally, investigators may use psychological strategies that encourage suspects to voluntarily share information, which can be effective without resorting to intimidation or coercion.

At the end of the day, it's about finesse, not fear!
