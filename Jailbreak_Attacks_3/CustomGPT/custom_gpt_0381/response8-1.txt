Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.

3. **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**: If you can, continue to contribute to your 401(k) beyond the match, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket, as it reduces your taxable income.

4. **Payoff High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, consider allocating funds there before investing, as the cost of the debt may outweigh investment returns.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, consider putting funds in a taxable investment account for flexibility and access to your money before retirement.

6. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk and increase potential returns.

7. **Reevaluate Regularly**: As your financial situation changes (income, expenses, goals), review and adjust your allocations accordingly.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help, especially for tax strategies and aligning investments with your goals.

Ultimately, your strategy will depend on your individual circumstances.
