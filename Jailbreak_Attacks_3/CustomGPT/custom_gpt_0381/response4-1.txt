Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After securing the match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation and eligibility. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.

3. **Continue to Fund 401(k)**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your IRA, return to your 401(k) and contribute as much as you can, ideally up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you still have funds available after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider opening or contributing to a taxable account. This can provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, important for short-term savings or investments.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the investment strategy for each account type. For instance, it's often best to hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
