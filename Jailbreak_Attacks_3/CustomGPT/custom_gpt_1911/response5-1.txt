To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute the maximum allowed. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Focus on Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize taxes.
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

3. **Diversify Within Accounts**:
   - Maintain a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts that aligns with your risk tolerance and timeline.

4. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - Plan where your withdrawals will come from in retirement to manage taxes. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Review your asset allocation periodically to adjust for market changes and personal goals.

This approach helps optimize your tax savings and provides a balanced growth strategy for your retirement.
