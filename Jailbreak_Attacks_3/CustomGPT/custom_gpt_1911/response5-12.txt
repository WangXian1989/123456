I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver issue (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying condition.

3. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options like liver transplant may be considered.

4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function are essential.

Always follow up with your healthcare provider for the best course of action tailored to your specific needs.
