Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. Aim to max out contributions if feasible.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k) contributions, consider maxing out a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Choose based on your current tax bracket and expected retirement income.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred; withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Income generated is taxed annually, but you have flexibility in accessing funds.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund covered before heavily investing in retirement accounts or taxable accounts.

4. **Investment Time Horizon**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in accounts where you wonâ€™t need the money for several years (like an IRA or 401(k)).
   - Use more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications from short-term capital gains.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Regular Contributions and Rebalancing**:
   - Set up automatic contributions and review your portfolio periodically to rebalance according to your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique circumstances.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your accounts.
