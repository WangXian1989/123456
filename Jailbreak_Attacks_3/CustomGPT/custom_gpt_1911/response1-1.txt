To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. If you can, aim to maximize your contributions ($22,500 for 2024).
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: After meeting your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA or Roth IRA, especially if you qualify for tax deductions or tax-free withdrawals.

### 2. **Understand Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate less taxable income or for short-term needs. Consider holding tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account. This helps manage risk and improve potential returns.

### 4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - Align your investments with your financial goals. For long-term goals (retirement, etc.), consider more equities; for short-term goals, a conservative approach may be better.

### 5. **Regular Monitoring and Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust as necessary to stay in line with your risk tolerance and goals.

### 6. **Consider Fees and Expenses**
   - Be mindful of any fees associated with your accounts. Lower-cost options can help maintain more of your investment returns.

### 7. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement. Generally, tap taxable accounts first, then traditional retirement accounts, and lastly Roth accounts for tax efficiency.

### Key Takeaway
Start with tax-advantaged accounts, ensure diversification, tailor your investments to your goals, and review your strategy regularly. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your situation.
