Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some best practices:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match if offered. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Maximize contributions, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket now; contributions are tax-deductible.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax deductions now.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, provided conditions are met.
   - Taxable accounts can generate capital gains, which are taxed differently (potentially favorably) than ordinary income.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Factor in Your Time Horizon**
   - Longer time horizons can tolerate more risk, suggesting more stocks in retirement accounts.

### 7. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes, typically starting with taxable accounts.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out to employer match.
- **IRA:** Contribute fully if eligible.
- **Taxable Account:** After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable for additional investing.

### Conclusion
The best strategy will align with your personal financial situation, so consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
