Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. This provides tax advantages depending on your income and withdrawal strategy.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out the match, continue to contribute to your 401(k), especially if it has low fees.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This allows flexibility and diversification.

5. **Investment Choices**: Choose low-cost index funds or ETFs for long-term growth, considering risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside these accounts to cover unexpected expenses without needing to withdraw from retirement accounts.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that fits your specific circumstances.
