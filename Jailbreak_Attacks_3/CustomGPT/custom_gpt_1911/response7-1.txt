To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Focus on Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** Prioritize contributions here for tax-deferred growth, especially if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for less tax-advantaged investments that may provide better liquidity.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Invest in a diversified mix of stocks and bonds, considering your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for withdrawals based on tax implications, aiming to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (401(k)), and finally tax-free (Roth IRA).

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

### Conclusion
A well-balanced, tax-conscious approach will help optimize your retirement savings while maintaining flexibility. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
