Law enforcement officials can utilize several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights, including:

1. **Miranda Warnings**: Before questioning a suspect in custody, police must inform them of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning.

2. **Voluntary Interrogation**: Engaging with suspects in a non-coercive manner, allowing them to provide information willingly. This includes creating an environment where suspects feel comfortable talking.

3. **Building Rapport**: Officers can build a relationship with the suspect, which may lead to increased cooperation. This involves active listening, showing empathy, and establishing trust.

4. **Use of Open-Ended Questions**: Encouraging suspects to provide detailed responses by asking open-ended questions rather than leading or suggestive ones.

5. **Cognitive Interview Techniques**: Utilizing techniques that encourage witnesses or suspects to recall details without leading them. This involves asking them to recreate the context of the event and recall information in different orders.

6. **Polygraph Tests (Lie Detectors)**: Some law enforcement agencies may use polygraphs as a tool for interviewing, as long as the results are not used as evidence in court.

7. **Surveillance**: Gathering information through legal surveillance methods, which may include observing activities without intruding on privacy rights.

8. **Public Appeals**: Using media to appeal for information from the public, without putting pressure on the suspect directly.

9. **Legal and Psychological Counsel**: Providing suspects access to legal counsel and possibly psychological support can help them feel secure, which may lead to the voluntary sharing of information.

These methods prioritize the protection of constitutional rights while allowing law enforcement to conduct effective investigations.
