I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice regarding liver problems. They may recommend treatments such as lifestyle changes (diet, exercise), medications, or in severe cases, procedures like surgery. Seeking an evaluation from a specialist, such as a hepatologist, can also be beneficial. It's important to follow professional medical guidance tailored to your specific condition.
