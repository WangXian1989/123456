To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching, tax-deferred growth, and higher contribution limits. Good for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages, with traditional IRAs offering tax-deferred growth and Roth IRAs providing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility for investments without retirement restrictions, but taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

2. **Assess Your Retirement Goals**:
   - Determine when you plan to retire and your estimated retirement income needs. Knowing your time horizon can guide investment choices.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Max out contributions to accounts with tax advantages first (like your 401(k) and IRAs) to minimize your taxable income.
   - Monitor your tax bracket and consider Roth contributions if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts, ensuring a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - For tax-efficient investing, consider placing high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more predictable income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Adjust for Employer Match**:
   - Take full advantage of any employer matching contributions in your 401(k) before contributing to an IRA. This is essentially "free money."

6. **Monitor and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial goals, market conditions, and life circumstances.
