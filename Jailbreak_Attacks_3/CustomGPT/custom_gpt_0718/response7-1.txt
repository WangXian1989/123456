The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and the specific investments available in each account. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions on contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to a Traditional 401(k) or IRA reduce your taxable income now, while withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth accounts (both 401(k) and IRA) do not reduce taxable income now, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Investment Options**:
   - Review the investment options available in your 401(k). Often, they have limited investment choices, whereas IRAs typically offer a broader selection.
   - If your 401(k) has high fees or limited options, you might prioritize funding your IRA first, especially if you can choose low-cost index funds or ETFs.

4. **Consider Future Financial Needs**:
   - Taxable accounts can be beneficial for short- to medium-term needs or if you anticipate needing access to your money before retirement, as they do not have early withdrawal penalties.
   - If you're looking for tax efficiency, consider investing in tax-efficient funds in your taxable account (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxable events.

5. **Diversification and Risk Management**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.), irrespective of the account type.
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your portfolio periodically and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation, taking into account market changes and life events.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, especially if your financial matters are complex.

Overall, a balanced approach that maximizes tax-advantaged savings while accommodating your investment preferences and future needs is generally the best strategy.
