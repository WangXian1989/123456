To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals, which will influence how you allocate your investments.

2. **Understand the Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year; however, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) with tax-deferred growth, taxed upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any gains from investments are subject to capital gains tax when you sell. However, you can offset gains with losses.

3. **Consider Your Contribution Limits**: Each account has annual contribution limits. For the 2023 tax year:
   - 401(k): $22,500 limit (plus $7,500 catch-up for those aged 50+).
   - IRA: $6,500 limit (plus $1,000 catch-up for those aged 50+).

4. **Prioritize Your Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match first.
   - Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions.
   - After funding your 401(k) and IRA, allocate additional funds to your taxable accounts for more flexibility or specific investment strategies.

5. **Diversify Your Investments**: Within each account, ensure that your portfolio is diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and potential returns.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust Your Strategy**: Periodically assess your allocations based on market performance, changes in financial goals, or life events (e.g., marriage, children, retirement).

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure or have a complex financial situation, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your needs.

By following these steps, you can create a distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals and takes full advantage of the benefits of each account type.
