Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Offers tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Provides tax advantages, with Roth IRAs allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible for withdrawals, but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Max out contributions to your 401(k) at least to the point of any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA next, particularly if you can use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for higher growth investments (stocks) since you'll defer or avoid taxes on gains.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep more liquid, stable investments in taxable accounts for easier access.

### 4. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax Efficient investing:** Place high-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and stock index funds in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

### 5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio and adjust contributions based on changing financial situations and market conditions.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach that prioritizes tax-advantaged growth while maintaining some liquidity in taxable accounts is usually the best strategy. Tailor your contributions based on your specific financial landscape and goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor to personalize your strategy further.
