Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your unique financial situation and goals, but here are some general strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Use this for higher-income years to take advantage of pre-tax contributions.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Keep investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on diversified index funds or target-date funds that align with your retirement timeline.
   - **IRA**: Use for individual strategies, such as specific sector investments or riskier assets that could benefit from tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Maintain liquidity for short-term needs while incorporating growth-oriented investments.

3. **Retirement Goals**:
   - Assess how much you need for retirement and balance contributions based on your projected retirement age and lifestyle.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Maximize contributions to your employerâ€™s 401(k) match first, then fund IRAs, followed by taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust allocations based on market performance and changes in personal circumstances.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
