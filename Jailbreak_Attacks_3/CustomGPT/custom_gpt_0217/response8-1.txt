The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts varies based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize this to maximize benefits.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, depending on whether you want tax deductions now (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals later (Roth).

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - High-income years: Contributing to a Traditional IRA or 401(k) may provide tax benefits.
   - Lower-income years: A Roth IRA may be advantageous for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or investments that generate lower tax liabilities (like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains).

5. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a suitable asset allocation across all accounts. Generally, consider placing more aggressive investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.
