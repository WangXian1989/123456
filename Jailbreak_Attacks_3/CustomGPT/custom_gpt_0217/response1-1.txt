To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA for tax advantages.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate income (like stocks) that you can hold long-term to minimize capital gains tax.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on tax-deferred growth (Traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth).

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-risk, long-term growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compounding.
   - Hold bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts for better tax treatment.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, adjusting based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, market conditions, and retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation.

By taking these steps, you'll optimize your investments for growth while managing tax efficiency.
