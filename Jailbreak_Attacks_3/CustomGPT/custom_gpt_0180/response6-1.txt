ðŸ’¡ Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considerations around tax efficiency, investment goals, and retirement planning. Hereâ€™s a straightforward approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributing enough to receive any employer match, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA or Roth IRA**: Depending on your eligibility (income limits), contribute to your IRA or Roth IRA for tax-free growth or tax deductions.

2. **Balance Among Accounts**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions in tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding taxable accounts. Use these for more liquid needs or if you expect to draw on these investments before retirement.

### Additional Tips:
- **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced asset allocation across all accounts tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Tax Implications**: Invest more tax-efficient assets (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax and consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts.

This strategy enhances your overall returns while managing tax liabilities effectively. If you have specific goals or circumstances, let me know for tailored advice! ðŸ˜Š
