Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) if eligible, as they offer tax advantages.
   - If you can, contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains, as you can take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates. This can include:
   - Stocks held for more than a year.
   - Tax-efficient funds or ETFs.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors, regardless of the account type.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Withdrawals and Timing**: Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize taxesâ€”consider pulling from taxable accounts first if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

These strategies can help optimize your asset distribution while considering tax implications and retirement goals.
