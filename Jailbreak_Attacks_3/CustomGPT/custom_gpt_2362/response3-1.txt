Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim for the maximum limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA (consider eligibility based on income) for tax advantages.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred; withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and income are taxed in the year theyâ€™re realized, making them less tax-efficient for long-term investments.

3. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals (like purchasing a home) as they offer more access without penalties.
   - Use retirement accounts for long-term growth, as they benefit from tax advantages.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. However, it can be strategic to hold different assets in each account type based on tax implications (e.g., place high-growth stocks in Roth IRA for tax-free growth).

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals. Adjust contributions as needed.

Ultimately, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor distributions specific to your situation.
