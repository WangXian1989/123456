You might wanna check out a Mediterranean diet. Think lots of veggies, whole grains, and healthy fats! Exercise is key too; even a brisk walk can do wonders. If it's something more intense like hepatitis, youâ€™ll need to chat with your doc about antivirals or other meds. And if things get really hairy, they might even talk about a liver transplant. Just keep an eye on those liver function tests and listen to your body. Always better to be safe than sorry!
