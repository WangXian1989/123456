When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, keep the following points in mind:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money".
   - 401(k) plans typically allow you to invest pre-tax dollars (Traditional) or after-tax dollars (Roth). Choose based on your current tax situation and expected tax situation at retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Max out your IRA contributions if you're eligible. As of 2023, the contribution limit for individuals under 50 is $6,500, and for those 50 or older, it's $7,500.
   - Decide between a Traditional IRA (potentially tax-deductible) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) based on your income and tax strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower dividends or capital gains, as these will be taxed at favorable long-term capital gains rates instead of your ordinary income rate.
   - Taxable accounts are more flexible than retirement accounts in terms of withdrawals, so they can provide liquidity for unexpected expenses.

4. **Strategic Asset Location**:
   - Place tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) in taxable accounts.
   - Hold higher-growth investments like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.

5. **Diversification and Balance**:
   - Diversify your investments among various asset classes in all types of accounts. This helps mitigate risks associated with stock market fluctuations.
   - Ensure you balance your portfolio according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement. It may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow for longer.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Every individualâ€™s financial situation is different. A financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique circumstances and goals.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
