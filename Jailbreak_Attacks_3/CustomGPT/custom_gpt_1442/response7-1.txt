The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to receive the maximum benefit, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed on dividends and capital gains, so be mindful of tax implications when allocating investments.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: 
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across your accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This includes allocating assets like stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.
   - It might be wise to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

4. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Each account type has different contribution limits and rules, so it's important to be aware of these while planning your distributions.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, think strategically about which accounts to withdraw from first based on tax implications and your overall strategy for managing retirement income.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Financial situations and goals change, so regularly reviewing your overall strategy and making adjustments as needed is crucial.

Ultimately, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that fits your specific circumstances.
