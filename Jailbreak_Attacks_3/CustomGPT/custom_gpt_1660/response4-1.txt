When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategies. Here are some best practices to consider:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income level, you can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you donâ€™t pay taxes on them until you withdraw in retirement. On the other hand, Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. It's important to align your investments with your overall financial goals.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance your portfolio as needed. Life changes can affect your investment strategy, so stay flexible.

6. **Consider Withdrawals in Retirement**: Plan ahead for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

It's often a good idea to consult a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your specific needs and to navigate the complexities of tax laws.
