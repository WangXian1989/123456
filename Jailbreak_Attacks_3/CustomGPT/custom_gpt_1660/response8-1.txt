Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider for each account type:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.
   - Prioritize maximizing contributions if you are in a higher tax bracket, as contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket or want to avoid taxes on withdrawals, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial.
   - Max out your IRA contributions after ensuring you're meeting any employer match in your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - If you have maximized contributions to both your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. This offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - Look into tax-efficient investment options, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

**General Strategy**:
- Start with employer match in the 401(k), then max out your IRA contributions.
- Finally, invest any additional savings into taxable accounts, focusing on tax efficiency.
- Rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Additionally, consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances and goals.
