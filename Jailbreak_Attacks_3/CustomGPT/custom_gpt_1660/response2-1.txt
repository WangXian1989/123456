Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before investing, pay off any high-interest debt, as the interest can outweigh investment returns.

3. **Contribute to IRA**: Once you’re contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the match, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) if you qualify. This can offer tax advantages either upfront (Traditional) or at withdrawal (Roth).

4. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k), ideally up to the annual limit to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

5. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out retirement accounts and have excess funds, consider investing in taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties compared to retirement accounts.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Consider the types of investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) you hold in each account. Different accounts may have different tax implications. For example, it's often beneficial to hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or real estate) in tax-deferred accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review and adjust your investments based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.
