Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a breakdown of how to approach this:

1. **401(k) Plans:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), impacting your current tax burden and future withdrawals.
   - **Investment Options:** Check the fees and options available in your plan. 

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA:** Choose based on your tax situation. Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth but has income limits; Traditional IRA may give you a tax deduction now but taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, you can contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Money here is accessible without penalties, making it suitable for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes; long-term investments are usually taxed at lower rates than short-term ones.

### General Strategy:
- **Start with the 401(k):** Max out the employer match and then consider contributing to an IRA for the tax advantages.
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have enough liquidity for emergencies outside of these accounts.
- **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use these for investments that may require more liquidity or for additional savings after maxing out retirement accounts.

### Suggested Allocation:
- **Maximize 401(k) up to match**
- **IRA contributions next**
- **Any excess savings could go into taxable accounts**

### Periodic Review:
Adjust your distribution strategy based on life changes, financial goals, and market conditions. 

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
