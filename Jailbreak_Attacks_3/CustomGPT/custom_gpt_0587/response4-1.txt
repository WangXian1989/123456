Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k), consider funding an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on income eligibility and tax situation).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional Accounts** (401(k) and traditional IRA): Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income. This may be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts** (Roth IRA): Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are flexible but taxed on capital gains and dividends. They may be used for short-term goals or emergencies.

3. **Evaluate Investment Goals**:
   - For long-term growth, focus on equities in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on potential growth. Use taxable accounts for more stable investments.
   - For short-term goals, consider holding cash or more liquid assets in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts. Each account type can hold different asset classes to manage overall risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you'll withdraw from each account in retirement. Consider tax implications and required minimum distributions (RMDs) for 401(k)s and traditional IRAs starting at age 73.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Regularly review your allocation to align with changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.
