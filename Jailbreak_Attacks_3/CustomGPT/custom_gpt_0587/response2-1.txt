Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for maximizing your retirement savings and minimizing taxes. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions after ensuring employer match in your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions lower your taxable income in the year you contribute, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest and dividends are taxed as income, but long-term capital gains may be taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **401(k) and IRAs:** Invest with a long-term horizon. Consider higher risk investments (stocks) for growth, especially in tax-deferred accounts, since capital gains and income don't incur taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax impact. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Goals and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Assess your retirement timeline and risk tolerance. Younger investors might lean more towards growth-oriented assets, while those closer to retirement may want to shift towards conservative investments.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure alignment with your financial goals and changing market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your individual financial situation and goals, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

By balancing contributions and investments thoughtfully across these accounts, you can establish a solid foundation for your financial future.
