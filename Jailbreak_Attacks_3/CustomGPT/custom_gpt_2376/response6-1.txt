To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA since these accounts offer tax benefits.
   - **Understand Withdrawals**: Assess when you'll need access to your funds, as taxable accounts allow more flexible withdrawals compared to retirement accounts.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Long-term Growth**: Invest more heavily in equities within tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compounded growth without immediate taxes.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Keep more liquid, lower-risk investments in taxable accounts for easier access.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - **Max Out Accounts**: Take full advantage of any employer match in your 401(k). After that, focus on funding an IRA before returning to your 401(k) contributions.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

By focusing on these key elements, you can effectively distribute your money among these three kinds of accounts while maximizing growth potential and minimizing tax liabilities.
