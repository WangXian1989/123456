I'm sorry to hear you're having liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. In general, treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in severe cases, surgery. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol and drugs that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe antiviral medications or other treatments.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and catch any complications early.

4. **Surgery**: In cases of severe liver damage or conditions like liver cancer, a liver transplant may be considered.

Please speak with a healthcare professional for the best course of action for your specific condition.
