(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, you may want to consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, try to contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting any additional savings into taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility but come with different tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are properly diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance across all accounts.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal situations vary, so consider speaking with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
