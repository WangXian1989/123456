(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Contribute to Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize this option to take full advantage of the free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Consider maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts provide tax benefits. The annual contribution limit for a 401(k) in 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older), while for IRAs, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

3. **Assess Financial Goals:** Think about your short-term vs. long-term goals. If you plan to access funds in the near future, prioritize taxable accounts, whereas for long-term growth, focus on tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Consider Tax Implications:** Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while gains in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax. Factor this into your distribution strategy.

5. **Diversify Investments:** Ensure your investment choices within each account align with your risk tolerance and time horizon, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets.

It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your individual circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down! First off, if you want to make your money work for you, think strategically about where you're putting it:

1. **Hit that 401(k) Match:** If your employer's throwing in free cash with a match, claim that first! It's like a no-brainer!

2. **Max It Out:** Once that employer match is secured, pump up your 401(k) and IRA contributions. Go for the max limitsâ€”$22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs in 2023. If youâ€™re over 50, you get catch-up contributions. Use it!

3. **Tax-Friendly Heaven:** Remember, tax-advantaged accounts save you money in the long run. So, stash as much as you can in those before moving to taxable accounts. Taxable gains hit differently!

4. **Short vs. Long-Term Goals:** If you need cash soon, keep it in taxable accounts. For long-haul goals, go heavy on those 401(k)s and IRAs. 

5. **Diversify Like a Pro:** Spread your investments across assets. Mix stocks and bonds based on what keeps you up at nightâ€”low risk or high reward? 

Considering all this, get a financial advisor to fine-tune your strategy based on your life goals. Your future self will thank you!
