Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." If possible, consider maxing out your contributions, subject to IRS limits.
   - **IRA**: Aim to contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income and tax bracket. This provides tax benefits either now or in retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional investments in taxable accounts. 
   - **Capital Gains Considerations**: Taxable accounts can offer tax advantages if you hold investments long-term, benefiting from lower capital gains tax rates.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and goals. Use a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all account types.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

5. **Consider Your Withdrawals**:
   - Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

Thus, the general approach could be:
- Maximize employer matches in a 401(k) first.
- Contribute to an IRA (preferably a Roth if eligible).
- Use taxable accounts for any additional savings to meet financial goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
