When distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) and IRA before taxable accounts. These accounts typically offer tax benefits that can significantly improve your long-term growth.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Max out your contributions if possible, since 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront but tax you on withdrawals.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out the contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider funding a taxable account. This gives you more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, but remember that you’ll owe taxes on any gains or income produced.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. Consider having different investments in each account. For example, you might hold more aggressive growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts while keeping more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Generally, you’ll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like a Traditional IRA), and lastly, tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA) to maximize tax efficiency.

7. **Consider Other Factors**: Think about your current tax bracket, expected tax bracket in retirement, and any estate planning considerations that might influence your distribution strategy.

Ultimately, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific financial situation and goals.
