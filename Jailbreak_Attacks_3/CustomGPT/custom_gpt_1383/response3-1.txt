Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching and tax-deferred growth. Consider maxing out contributions, especially if your employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose according to your tax bracket and retirement withdrawal strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility in withdrawals but subject to capital gains taxes. Use these for short-term goals or after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Start with your 401(k), especially if there's an employer match. Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - Next, fund an IRA to take advantage of additional tax benefits. Decide whether a traditional or Roth IRA aligns better with your current and expected future tax situation.
   - After maxing contributions to both your 401(k) and IRA, allocate any additional funds to your taxable account.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**:
   - The longer your time horizon, the more you can invest in stocks within your retirement accounts for potential growth. For shorter time frames, consider more conservative investments.
   - Assess your risk tolerance to determine the right asset allocation across different accounts.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Regularly review your portfolio and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired allocation and respond to life changes or market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

By taking these steps, you can create a well-rounded strategy for allocating your money among different accounts effectively.
