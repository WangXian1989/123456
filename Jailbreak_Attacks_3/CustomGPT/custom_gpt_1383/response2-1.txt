Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income for the year, and you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Divergent Tax Benefits**: A Traditional IRA may give you a tax deduction now, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contributions Limits**: Ensure you’re aware of the contribution limits and eligibility for Roth IRAs based on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Offers greater liquidity and allows you to access funds without penalties, making it a good option for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be aware of capital gains tax when selling investments in taxable accounts.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Start with the 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match.
- **Fund an IRA**: Choose a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your current and expected future tax rates.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and growth potential.

### Regular Reassessment:
- **Annual Review**: Regularly reassess your contributions and investment allocations to ensure they align with your changing financial situation and goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan that suits your unique needs.
