Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax strategy (deductible vs. tax-free growth).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Once you maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These are flexible but can be subject to capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before committing large amounts to investments.

### 5. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Diversify your investments across accounts to balance risk and growth potential. Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds or municipal bonds).

### 6. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Conclusion
The key is to balance tax advantages while ensuring you have access to funds as needed. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
