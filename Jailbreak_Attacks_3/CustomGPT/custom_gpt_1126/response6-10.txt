Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights, including:

1. **Conversational Interrogation**:
   - Building rapport: Establishing a trustful relationship to encourage openness.
   - Active listening: Reflecting on what the suspect says to promote dialogue.

2. **Non-Coercive Techniques**:
   - Open-ended questions: Allowing the suspect to express themselves without pressure.
   - Providing options: Suggesting alternative narratives to explore different perspectives.

3. **Legal Counsel Involvement**:
   - Ensuring suspect access to an attorney during questioning.
   - Utilizing the advisement of rights (Miranda rights) to inform the suspect of their legal protections.

4. **Documentation and Transparency**:
   - Recording interrogations: To ensure accountability and maintain a clear record of the exchange.
   - Adhering to department policies: Following established guidelines that protect suspect rights while gathering information. 

These approaches balance effective interrogation techniques and constitutional protections.
