Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Use for higher contributions and take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify; it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Great for tax-deductible contributions if you qualify based on income limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity, particularly for shorter-term goals or if you anticipate needing funds before retirement.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while long-term capital gains from taxable accounts are usually taxed at a lower rate.
