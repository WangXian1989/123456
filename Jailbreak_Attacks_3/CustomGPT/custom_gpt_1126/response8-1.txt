To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to maximize contributions (up to the annual limit) if you have a match.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure a sufficient emergency fund is available in a liquid account to avoid early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

4. **Investments in Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liability.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about your future tax brackets and whether you anticipate needing the funds before retirement to guide your strategy.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically revisit your distribution based on changes in your financial situation, retirement goals, or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

This strategic approach helps optimize your savings for long-term growth while managing tax implications effectively.
