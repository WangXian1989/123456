To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understanding Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth; ideal for high contributions up to the annual limit.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Provides tax advantages; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility for accessing funds without penalties; subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. **Contribution Strategy**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Prioritize Tax Advantages**: 
     - If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
     - Use Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon withdrawal.

### 3. **Diversification of Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Tailor your investment choices based on risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Consider Tax Efficiency**: 
     - Hold higher-growth stock investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
     - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends since they are taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - **Review and Adjust**: Periodically reassess your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

### Summary
- Start with maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially matching grants.
- Incorporate contributions to a Roth IRA if applicable.
- Use taxable accounts for flexibility while optimizing tax efficiency.
- Regularly review and rebalance your allocation according to your financial goals. 

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
