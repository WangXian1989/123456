Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Contribute to Your 401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching funds. This reduces your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. Depending on your tax bracket, you may prefer one over the other.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have liquid savings for emergencies to avoid early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Some suggest holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes on bond interest.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep your investments aligned with your financial goals by reviewing your allocation periodically.
