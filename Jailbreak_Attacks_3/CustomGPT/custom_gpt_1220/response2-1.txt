Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **401(k) Plans**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or post-tax (Roth 401(k)), which can provide tax advantages based on your situation.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement. Your current and future tax brackets can help dictate which is more beneficial.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum amount allowed annually to take full advantage of tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Use for Short-Term Goals**: Taxable accounts are best for funds you'll need before retirement. They provide flexibility without the penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.
   - **Investment Types**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

**General Approach**:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts.
- **Diversification**: Diversify investments across asset classes to reduce risk.
- **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on long-term growth strategies in retirement accounts, while balancing risk in taxable accounts based on your time horizon.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A certified financial planner can help tailor a strategy based on your unique financial situation and goals.

Ultimately, keep your retirement timeline and risk tolerance in mind when deciding the percentages to allocate to each account type.
