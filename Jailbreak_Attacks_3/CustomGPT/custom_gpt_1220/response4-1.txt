The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general considerations to help you make decisions:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute. Consider your current tax bracket and expected tax situation in retirement.

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional vs. Roth):**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Like a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal. This might be a good option if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement. This is advantageous if you believe your tax rate will be higher in the future or if you want more tax flexibility in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of contribution limits for both Traditional and Roth IRAs. For the 2023 tax year, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Funds in a taxable account can be accessed at any time without penalties, making them a good option for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Implications:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in a taxable account. Strategies like tax-loss harvesting can help manage tax liabilities.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure that your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) is in line with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Diversifying across accounts can provide tax efficiency.

5. **Long-Term Goals:**
   - Consider your time horizon for withdrawals. Accounts designed for retirement (401(k), IRA) should generally remain invested longer than taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review:**
   - Regularly review your investment strategy and account distributions, especially as your financial situation changes. Rebalancing your portfolio can help maintain your desired asset allocation.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that fits your personal financial circumstances and goals.
