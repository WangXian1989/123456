Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income. Consider maxing out your contributions if you are in a high tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth, but you pay taxes upon withdrawal. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, assuming certain conditions are met.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits and eligibility for deductibility (for Traditional IRAs) based on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Accessibility**: These accounts offer flexibility since you can withdraw funds at any time without penalties. However, you will be liable for capital gains taxes on investments held for over a year.
   - **Optimal Investments**: Consider holding investments with lower turnover and dividends—like index funds or ETFs—in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

**Allocation Strategy**:
- Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) up to the match.
- Next, prioritize funding your IRA, especially if you can contribute to both a Traditional and a Roth IRA.
- Use your taxable accounts for additional savings, focusing on investments that are tax-efficient.

**Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your unique circumstances.
