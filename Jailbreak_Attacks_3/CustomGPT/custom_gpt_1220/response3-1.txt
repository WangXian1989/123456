The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors, including your financial goals, investment timeline, current tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money." Aim to max out contributions if possible, as they reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on income limits and your future tax expectations.

2. **Consider Investment Options**:
   - **401(k)**: These often have limited investment choices. Choose a diversified mix of funds that align with your investment strategy.
   - **IRA**: IRAs typically offer a wider variety of investment options, which may allow for better diversification. Select investments that align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Here, you can invest in anything from stocks to bonds to real estate. Keep tax efficiency in mind; for example, consider holding low-turnover investments or tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Use a Balanced Approach**:
   - Assess your overall asset allocation and ensure you maintain a balance across all account types. This might mean allocating more towards equities in one account while keeping more fixed-income investments in another based on their respective tax implications.

4. **Regularly Reassess and Adjust**:
   - Financial situations and tax laws can change. Regularly revisit your allocation strategy to ensure it still meets your goals.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Different accounts have different tax implications, and strategic withdrawals can minimize your overall tax burden.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation, helping you optimize your investment strategy across all accounts.

Ultimately, the best approach is to create a holistic plan that considers your entire financial picture and goals while maximizing tax efficiency along the way.
