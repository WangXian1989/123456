To distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications of each account type. 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, growing tax-deferred until withdrawal, while withdrawals from taxable accounts incur capital gains tax.

2. **Employer Matches**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Aim to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, like your 401(k) and IRA, before investing in taxable accounts. For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older) and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Investment Strategy**: Determine your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Allocate assets based on the account type:
   - Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid taxes on capital gains.
   - Consider lower-risk investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts where interest income is taxed as ordinary income.

5. **Diversification and Rebalancing**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, regularly rebalancing to stay aligned with your investment goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquid savings outside these accounts to cover emergencies, which helps avoid early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation and goals.
