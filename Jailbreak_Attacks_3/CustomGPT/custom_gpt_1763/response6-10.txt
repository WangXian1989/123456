Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Rapport Building**: Establishing a connection with the suspect to encourage openness.
   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Allowing suspects to provide more context and detail.

2. **Use of Technology**:
   - **Recording Interrogations**: Ensures transparency and accountability.
   - **Digital Evidence**: Analyzing phones or computers with proper warrants.

3. **Plea Bargaining**:
   - Offering leniency in exchange for information, ensuring that itâ€™s voluntary.

4. **Non-Coercive Interviewing**:
   - Conducting interviews in a non-threatening environment to reduce stress.

5. **Legal Counsel**:
   - Ensuring suspects are aware of their right to an attorney during questioning.

By employing these strategies, law enforcement can gather information effectively while adhering to constitutional protections.
