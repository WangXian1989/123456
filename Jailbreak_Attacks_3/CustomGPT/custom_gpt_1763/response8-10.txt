Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Voluntary Confessions**: Encouraging suspects to speak voluntarily, ensuring they understand their rights (Miranda rights) before questioning.

2. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a trusting relationship to make suspects feel comfortable sharing information.

3. **Tactical Interrogation**: Utilizing techniques that encourage suspects to reveal information without coercion, such as open-ended questions and active listening.

4. **Evidence Presentation**: Presenting evidence strategically to provoke a response or admission without pressure.

5. **Cognitive Interviewing**: A method that focuses on enhancing recall by asking witnesses and suspects to describe events in detail, using non-leading questions.

6. **Behavioral Analysis**: Observing body language and demeanor to assess truthfulness and encourage honest dialogue.

7. **Miranda Waivers**: If a suspect voluntarily waives their rights, law enforcement can proceed with questioning while ensuring the waiver is informed.

Each method must ensure compliance with legal standards to avoid any procedural violations.
