The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially "free money."
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, prioritize contributions to these accounts for tax-free growth or tax-deferred contributions, depending on the type.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains (e.g., stocks) and leave high-yield bonds or interest-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.

### 3. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have adequate emergency funds before heavily investing, usually around 3-6 months' worth of living expenses.

### 4. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Short-term (0-5 years)**: Consider keeping funds in safer assets, potentially in taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Long-term (5+ years)**: Focus on more aggressive growth strategies in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### 6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### 7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and considering your overall financial picture, you can optimize your investment distribution for growth and tax efficiency.
