Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategy you might consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions) or a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions). This adds tax diversification.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Roth contributions grow tax-free, while Traditional contributions can lower your current tax bill.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed yearly on dividends and capital gains. They provide flexibility for short-term goals.

### 3. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account type. Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon when selecting investments.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Regularly review your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and adjust contributions as needed based on performance and life changes.

### 5. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - In retirement, withdraw from accounts strategically to minimize taxes. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice considering your specific situation and help you develop a comprehensive strategy.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced portfolio that maximizes tax advantages and aligns with your financial goals.
