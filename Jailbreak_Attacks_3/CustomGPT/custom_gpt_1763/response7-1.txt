Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Tax-deferred growth, employer match potential (if offered).
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Tax-deferred or tax-free growth (depends on traditional vs. Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—this is free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Max out contributions to your IRA for tax advantages. If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings once you've maximized your retirement accounts.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Assess your current tax bracket and plan for future withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts may be beneficial for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds.

### 4. **Balance Investment Strategy:**
   - Diversify investments among all accounts based on your risk tolerance and timeline.
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments (like bonds) can be in taxable accounts to minimize taxable events.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Reassess your contributions and asset allocation annually or after major life changes.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personalized advice can provide insights tailored to your financial situation and goals.

By strategically distributing funds and continuously monitoring your allocations, you can optimize your investment growth and tax efficiency.
