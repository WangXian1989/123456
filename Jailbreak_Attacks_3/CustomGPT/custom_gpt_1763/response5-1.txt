Effectively distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and age. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer matching contributions first. Contribute the maximum allowable amount if possible, especially if you are in a high tax bracket since contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: If eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs can be valuable if you need to reduce current taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for short- to medium-term goals and offer more flexibility with withdrawals. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

**General Strategy**:
- Start with contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
- Contribute to an IRA, prioritizing Roth if eligible.
- Allocate any additional savings to your taxable account for flexibility.

Adjust based on your retirement timeline, tax situation, and investment opportunities.
