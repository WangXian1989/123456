When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take several factors into account:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs function similarly to a 401(k) for tax purposes. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, as contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on capital gains and dividends, so these should generally hold more tax-efficient investments.

2. **Employer Match**:
   - Take advantage of any employer match in your 401(k). Contributing enough to receive the maximum match is essentially free money.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Consider your investment goals. If you have long-term goals (e.g., retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - For shorter-term goals, a taxable account might be more suitable, as it offers more flexibility.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) depending on your risk tolerance.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. In 2023, 401(k) contributions can be up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older), while IRA contributions can be up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older).

6. **Withdrawal Needs**:
   - Consider when you may need to access your funds. Early withdrawal from traditional retirement accounts can incur penalties.

**General Strategy**:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
2. Maximize contributions to a Roth IRA if eligible, for tax-free growth.
3. Once the above accounts are maxed out, consider contributing to a taxable account, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

Ultimately, itâ€™s a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation and goals.
