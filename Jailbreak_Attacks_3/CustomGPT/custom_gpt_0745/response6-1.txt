Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can enhance your investment growth while managing taxes. Hereâ€™s a strategic breakdown:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if possible to take advantage of tax deferral.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to an IRA for additional tax benefits. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA may provide initial tax deductions.

### 2. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely:**
   - **Invest for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments you may want to access before retirement without penalties. 
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Focus on index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes, considering tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:
   - **Prioritize Contributions:** Allocate 15-20% of your income to your 401(k) (up to the match), followed by $6,000-$7,000 to your IRA (if eligible), and then funnel additional savings into your taxable accounts. 
   - **Reevaluate Annually:** Adjust based on changing income, goals, and tax laws to optimize your distribution.

This approach can help balance growth and liquidity while minimizing tax liabilities over time.
