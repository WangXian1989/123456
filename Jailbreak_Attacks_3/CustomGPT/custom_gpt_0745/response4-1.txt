When considering how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to think about several factors, including your current financial situation, your long-term savings goals, and the tax implications of each account type. Here are some general strategies to guide your distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to the 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:** Both traditional 401(k)s and IRAs may offer tax-deferred growth, meaning you won’t pay taxes on that money until you withdraw it in retirement. Contributions to a Roth IRA, on the other hand, are made with after-tax dollars but can grow tax-free.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency savings fund in place before putting money into these investment accounts. It’s generally advised to save three to six months' worth of living expenses in a liquid account.

4. **Diversification:** Think about how you are diversifying your investments within these accounts. Each account type can hold various assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.). Ensure you're not overly concentrated in one type of investment.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Don't forget about your taxable accounts. Having investments here can provide flexibility for withdrawals without the penalties associated with retirement accounts—ideal for short-term needs or unexpected expenses.

6. **Long-term Goals and Withdrawals:** Consider your long-term financial goals. If you anticipate needing to access funds before retirement, you might want to allocate a larger portion to taxable accounts.

7. **Rebalance and Review Regularly:** Periodically reassess your allocations and investment performance across all account types to ensure they align with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

It's always recommended to consult with a financial advisor to tailor any strategy to your specific needs and situation.
