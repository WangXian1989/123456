I’m not a doctor, but if you’ve got liver problems, your best bet is to consult a healthcare professional. They can provide the best treatment options based on your specific condition. Common treatments can include lifestyle changes, medications, and in severe cases, liver transplants. Just take care of yourself and follow your doctor’s advice, alright?
