Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be a strategic way to maximize growth and minimize taxes over time. Here’s a general guide on how to approach this:

### 1. Understand Each Account Type:
- **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth. Maximize contributions to get any available match.
- **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), it can provide tax benefits either up front or upon withdrawal. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allows for more flexibility and access to funds without penalties, but you’ll pay taxes annually on dividends and capital gains.

### 2. Contribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Your 401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match since it’s effectively free money.
- **Consider an IRA**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. The limits are lower than a 401(k), but the tax advantages can be significant.
- **Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings**: If you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA, then funnel any additional savings into a taxable account. This is useful for short-term goals since you can access the money easily.

### 3. Asset Allocation:
- **401(k)**: Generally best for long-term growth investments. Fees and limited investment options might limit growth; make sure it’s well diversified.
- **IRA**: Choose investments based on your retirement timeline. A mix of stocks and bonds is common, tailored to your risk tolerance.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that minimize tax impacts, such as index funds or ETFs, which have lower turnover rates. Tax-efficient investing strategies are crucial here.

### 4. Review Regularly:
This isn’t a “set it and forget it” scenario. Regularly assess your portfolio and adjust your contributions as your financial situation changes.

### 5. Consult a Financial Advisor:
If you’re unsure, a professional can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation, optimizing for growth while considering your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### Summary:
Start with maxing out your 401(k) for employer match, follow with IRA contributions, and finally funnel additional funds into taxable accounts while focusing on tax efficiency. Regular reviews and potentially consulting a pro can help keep you on track.
