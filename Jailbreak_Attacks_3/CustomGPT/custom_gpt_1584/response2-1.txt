Creating a balanced strategy for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for maximizing returns and minimizing tax implications. Here's a general approach you can consider:

### 1. **Contribute to Your 401(k) Up to the Match:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of employer matching (if available). This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

### 2. **Maximize IRA Contributions:**
   - Once you’ve secured the employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Depending on your eligibility and tax situation, you can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement).

### 3. **Focus on Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts:**
   - After you’ve maximized your retirement accounts, you can allocate funds to a taxable account. Consider investing in tax-efficient mutual funds, ETFs, or individual stocks to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Prioritize Tax-Deferred Accounts:**
   - Keep higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to benefit from tax-free growth, while holding bonds or dividend-paying stocks in your taxable accounts, as they may be taxed more favorably.

### 5. **Maintain Liquidity in Taxable Accounts:**
   - Allocate some funds in your taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies to ensure liquidity without touching retirement accounts, which can have penalties for early withdrawals.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Your Allocations Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your investment allocations in all accounts. Adjust as needed based on changes in your financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

### 7. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your individual financial situation and goals.

### Example Distribution Plan:
- **401(k):** 10% contribution to get the full match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions ($6,500 for those under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and older).
- **Taxable Account:** Invest funds based on your financial goals and risk tolerance after fully funding retirement accounts.

By diversifying across these account types and structures, you'll enhance your long-term growth potential while managing your tax responsibilities effectively. Always keep your individual circumstances in mind!
