Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a breakdown to guide your decision:

### 1. **Prioritize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - If your employer offers a match, contributing enough to get the full match is usually the best first step, as it’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deferred, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. This is advantageous if you anticipate higher taxes in the future.

### 3. **Emergency Savings:**
   - Ensure you have enough in liquid, accessible savings before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

### 4. **Investment Goals:**
   - **Long-Term Savings:** Focus on maxing out retirement accounts first, given their tax advantages.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Use taxable accounts if you need access to funds before retirement.

### 5. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Consider putting higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Keep bonds or other interest-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid taxable income from those investments.

### 6. **Diversification:**
   - Maintain a diverse investment portfolio across all accounts to reduce risk.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- Maximize 401(k) contributions to the employer match.
- Contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional, depending on your situation).
- Any remaining funds can go into taxable accounts for additional investments or liquidity.

### Continuous Review:
- Periodically review your allocation based on changes in tax laws, your financial situation, and market conditions.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
- If you're unsure, a financial advisor can tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances and goals.

By taking these steps, you can create a balanced approach to using your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively.
