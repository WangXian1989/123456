Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a positive relationship can encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Utilizing techniques that promote memory recall without coercion, helping suspects reconstruct details.

2. **Miranda Warnings**:
   - Ensuring suspects are aware of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning.

3. **Consent-Based Interviews**:
   - Conducting voluntary interviews where suspects are informed of their rights and agree to speak without pressure.

4. **Use of Non-Confrontational Strategies**:
   - Employing friendly, respectful questioning techniques instead of aggressive tactics, which can foster trust.

These methods prioritize ethical considerations while aiming to gather necessary information.
