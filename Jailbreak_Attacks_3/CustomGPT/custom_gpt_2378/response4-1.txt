Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and the specifics of each account. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts are often pre-tax (traditional) or tax-free (Roth), allowing your investments to grow without immediate tax implications. Prioritize maxing out these contributions if you can.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account separate from these investments before allocating significant amounts to retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Long-term Growth**: Focus on stocks and equity-heavy investments in retirement accounts, where they can grow tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in more tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your changing goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your unique situation and optimize your asset allocation for tax efficiency and growth potential.
