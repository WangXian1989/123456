Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get your employer's match; it's free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed, especially if you have a high-income year.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. Prioritize contributions based on your tax situation.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for funds you may need before retirement. They allow for greater flexibility but are subject to capital gains tax. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds here.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Aggressive Growth Investments**: Consider holding these in tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., 401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes on gains.
   - **Income-Generating Investments**: Place these in taxable accounts to benefit from lower rates on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your allocations annually to align with your goals and adjust based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Considerations
- **Age**: Your strategy may shift as you near retirement; prioritize liquidity and income in older age.
- **Income Tax Bracket**: Understand how distributions will affect your overall tax liability during retirement.

### Final Tip
Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation for optimal results.
