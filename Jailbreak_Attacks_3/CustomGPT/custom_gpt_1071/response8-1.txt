The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Utilize IRAs**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deferral.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. This can give you flexibility for early withdrawals and other investment opportunities.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes across all accounts to balance risk and growth.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and consider holding bonds or high-turnover funds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

6. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your allocations as your financial situation or goals change.

Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
