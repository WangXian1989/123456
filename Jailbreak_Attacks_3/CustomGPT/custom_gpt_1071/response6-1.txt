Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax strategy for the year.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency in Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest in Tax-Efficient Funds**: Choose index funds or ETFs that generate fewer capital gains.
   - **Utilize Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Offset gains by selling losing investments.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts first.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate more funds to taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on performance, tax changes, or life events.

### Final Tip
Work with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation for optimal results.
