The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Contribute to 401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match if available. This is effectively free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth). IRAs offer tax advantages that can enhance your retirement savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you've maxed out your retirement account contributions and still have funds to invest, consider taxable accounts. They provide flexibility for withdrawals, but be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Invest in a mix of asset classes across all accounts to spread risk. Use tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs in your taxable accounts to minimize taxable events.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Place higher-taxed assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep lower-taxed investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to manage your tax liability effectively.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.
