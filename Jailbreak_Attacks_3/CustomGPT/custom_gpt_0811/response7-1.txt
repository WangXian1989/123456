To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then fund your IRA (traditional or Roth) up to its limit. This ensures you take advantage of tax benefits.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional 401(k) or IRA may be beneficial to defer taxes. If you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, consider Roth options, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Emergency Funds**: Maintain a separate emergency fund in a taxable account to ensure liquidity without penalties for early withdrawal.

4. **Investment Choices**: Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to shelter them from taxes. Keep stocks with higher growth potential in taxable accounts for favorable long-term capital gains treatment.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts, considering the specific investments in each account type.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your account allocations periodically to maintain your target asset allocation and adjust for any market movements.

Consulting a financial advisor tailored to your individual situation can also provide personalized guidance.
