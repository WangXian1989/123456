To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer matching contributions if available; this is essentially free money.
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth, which can be advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Allocate funds to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - If you're considering a traditional IRA, remember that contributions may be tax-deductible, providing immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term goals or as an emergency fund since funds can be accessed without penalties.
   - Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds) and consider capital gains implications.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts, considering risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Stocks may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds can be placed in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

Tailoring these strategies to your specific financial situation and retirement goals is key.
