Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the maximum limit, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket to benefit from pre-tax contributions.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that may benefit from capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed more favorably.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and return according to your investment strategy.

5. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your contributions and allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal financial situations.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a tailored plan that considers your unique circumstances.
