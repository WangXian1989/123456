When considering the distribution of your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to tailor your strategy to your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match contribution on your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Once you're contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the match, consider contributing to an IRA. Traditional IRAs can provide tax advantages, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose the one that aligns with your current tax situation and future expectations.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k). This can help you save more for retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out your retirement accounts, consider allocating funds to a taxable investment account. Taxable accounts can provide more flexibility for earlier withdrawals without penalties (although you will have to pay taxes on gains).

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be aware of the tax implications tied to each type of account:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay capital gains tax on profits when you sell investments.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and that your portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and goals.

Itâ€™s wise to consult with a financial advisor to create a strategy that fits your specific needs and circumstances. They can help you analyze your tax situation and investment preferences for a tailored approach.
