Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some tips to guide you in making this decision:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your current and expected future tax rates. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial, as it allows tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Assess your short-term vs. long-term needs. For long-term goals, such as retirement, you may want to allocate more funds to tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals (e.g., saving for a home), consider keeping funds in taxable accounts where you can access them without penalties.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account type. Ensure you're not overly concentrated in one asset class or sector.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts, as capital gains taxes could affect your overall return.
   - Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Think ahead to your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Generally, youâ€™ll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

6. **Periodic Review**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're feeling uncertain, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, the best approach will depend on your individual financial picture, including your age, risk tolerance, and future financial goals.
