To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Your Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** This is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that may offer tax advantages, often with matching contributions from your employer. Contributions are typically made pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** This can be a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are regular investment accounts where you can invest in stocks, bonds, and other assets. Earnings are subject to taxes in the year they are realized.

2. **Assess Your Financial Goals:**
   - Determine your short-term, medium-term, and long-term financial goals. This will influence how you allocate funds across these accounts.

3. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - Start by maximizing employer contributions in your 401(k) to take full advantage of any matching. This is essentially free money.
   - Next, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it provides tax-free growth and withdrawal benefits. If not eligible, focus on a traditional IRA.
   - After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to your taxable investment account for flexibility and liquidity.

4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Utilize tax-efficient investment strategies in your taxable accounts. Invest in index funds or ETFs that generate fewer taxable events.
   - Focus on holding investments long-term to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in income, financial goals, and investment performance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice that considers your unique financial situation, consulting a certified financial advisor can be very beneficial. They can help tailor a distribution strategy to meet your specific needs.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy within your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
