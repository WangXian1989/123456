Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach centered on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s how you might consider allocating your funds:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Begin by contributing enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If your goal is retirement savings, aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) match, focus on your IRA. If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need sooner or for assets that generate favorable tax treatment (like qualified dividends or capital gains). This can provide liquidity without penalties for early withdrawal.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments in this account, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax impacts.

### Key Considerations:
- **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments within each account type to mitigate risk and align with your investment strategy.
- **Tax Efficiency:** Prioritize tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep more tax-efficient assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

By following this structured approach, you can optimize your overall investment strategy, balancing growth potential with tax implications effectively. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
