The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general guideline:

1. **Max out employer-sponsored plans first:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money that can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. A traditional IRA may give you a tax deduction on contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Maximize your 401(k) contributions:** Continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Contributions to a 401(k) are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute.

4. **Invest in taxable accounts as needed:** Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any additional savings to taxable brokerage accounts. This provides flexibility with withdrawals and may be beneficial for shorter-term goals.

5. **Rebalance and adjust:** Periodically review your portfolio allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance, goals, and the performance of your investments. As you approach retirement, consider shifting toward more conservative investments.
