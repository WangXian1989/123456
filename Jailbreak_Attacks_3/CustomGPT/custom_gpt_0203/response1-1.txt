Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - Maximize any employer match first.
   - Contribute enough to take full advantage of the match, as this is effectively "free money."

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it for tax-free growth.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA may be more beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for short-term savings or for investments that generate capital gains, as they may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxable distributions.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:

- **Retirement Focus (Age 50+):**
  - 50% in 401(k)
  - 30% in IRA
  - 20% in taxable accounts

- **Aggressive Growth (Age 30-50):**
  - 60% in 401(k)
  - 20% in IRA
  - 20% in taxable accounts

- **Savings for Short-Term Goals:**
  - Prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity.
  
### Review Regularly:
- Adjust your allocation annually based on performance, changing tax laws, and your financial situation.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
- A personalized plan can address your unique financial situation effectively.
