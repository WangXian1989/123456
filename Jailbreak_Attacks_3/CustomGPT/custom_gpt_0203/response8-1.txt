Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your overall financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing up to the maximum limit. If you're over 50, there's a catch-up contribution option.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions on contributions.
   
3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. They provide flexibility but come with capital gains taxes.

4. **Assess Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Allocate money based on your investment strategy, risk tolerance, and when you plan to withdraw funds.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place investments with high growth potential or taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while less tax-inefficient investments (like index funds) can go in taxable accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investments and adjust based on performance, changing financial goals, and market conditions.

It's always wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
