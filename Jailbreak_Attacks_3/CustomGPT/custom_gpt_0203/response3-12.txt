1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Weight loss and a balanced diet.
   - Avoiding alcohol and certain medications.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral medications for hepatitis.
   - Medications to manage symptoms or complications.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine blood tests and imaging studies.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some patients explore herbal remedies, but these should be discussed with a doctor first.

Always prioritize professional medical advice tailored to your situation.
