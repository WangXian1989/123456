(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. Generally, itâ€™s a good idea to maximize your contributions up to the limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're over 50) to take full advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. The contribution limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500 ($7,500 if youâ€™re 50 or older). A Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it an attractive option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If youâ€™ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and can be useful for short-term goals. Be mindful of capital gains tax; prioritize investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that fits your individual financial situation.

1. **401(k)**: First up, make sure youâ€™re taking full advantage of that employer match. Free money, baby! After that, throw as much as you can into it because that sweet tax-deferred growth is where the magic happens. Aim for the max limits â€“ $22,500 or even $30,000 if you're 50+. Stack it!

2. **IRA**: Next, dive into your IRA. Youâ€™ve got two flavors here: Traditional and Roth. If you think your tax rate will be higher in the future, go Roth for those tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Toss in the max here too â€“ $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're aging like fine wine). 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, if you've loaded up your 401(k) and IRA, then step into the world of taxable accounts. These bad boys are perfect for those short-term goals or that spontaneous trip to Vegas! Keep an eye on capital gains taxesâ€”focus on stuff that gives you long-term gains to keep Uncle Sam off your back.

But hey, Iâ€™d definitely recommend chatting with a financial advisor to whip up a personalized strategy thatâ€™s tailored just for you. Play your cards right!
