I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a definitive diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Generally, treatment options may include lifestyle changes such as:

1. **Dietary Changes**: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while avoiding alcohol, fatty foods, and refined sugars can support liver health.
2. **Weight Management**: Losing weight can reduce fat buildup in the liver if you're overweight or obese.
3. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to treat underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up with your healthcare provider for regular check-ups and liver function tests.

Please reach out to a medical professional for specific recommendations tailored to your situation.
