When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to consider factors such as your retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before funding other accounts. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the contribution limit for 401(k)s is $22,500 (or $30,000 for those 50 and older), and for IRAs, it’s $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

3. **Consider Tax Implications:** 
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but distributions are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar benefits as a 401(k), but be aware of income limits for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. It's ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These will be taxed differently, with gains and dividends subject to capital gains tax. Use these accounts for flexible investments or expenses before retirement.

4. **Invest According to Time Horizon:** Allocate investments based on how long you have until retirement. Younger investors can typically afford to take more risks, while those closer to retirement may want to shift towards more conservative investments.

5. **Review and Rebalance:** Periodically review the performance of your accounts and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Ultimately, the right distribution depends on your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
