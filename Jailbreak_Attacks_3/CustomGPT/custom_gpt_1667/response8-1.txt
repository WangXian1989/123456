When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to follow a strategy that aligns with your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing the maximum allowed to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) as these accounts offer tax advantages that can benefit your long-term growth.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA, continue putting money into your 401(k) up to the contribution limit. The tax-deferred growth can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. It's a flexible option that allows for access to funds without penalty, although you'll pay taxes on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Equities typically offer higher long-term growth potential, while bonds can provide stability.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Remember that each investment type has different tax implications. For instance, holding investments for over a year in a taxable account can result in long-term capital gains tax, which is usually lower than short-term rates.

7. **Revisit Periodically**: Your financial situation and the market can change, so periodically review your distribution strategy and adjust contributions based on your evolving goals and the performance of your investments.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this distribution strategy to your individual circumstances and objectives.
