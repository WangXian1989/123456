I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that if you're facing liver issues, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver problems can include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, and medications to manage specific conditions. In some cases, procedures such as liver transplantation may be necessary. Always seek guidance from a medical expert for the best approach tailored to your situation.
