Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some key considerations to help you decide:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), which can influence your tax situation now and in retirement.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Contribution Limits**: IRAs have lower annual contribution limits than 401(k)s. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify based on income.
   - **Investment Options**: IRAs usually offer a broader range of investments compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts donâ€™t have the same restrictions as retirement accounts, making them great for shorter-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing and withdrawing.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Maximize 401(k)**: Contribute enough to attain the full employer match.
2. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
3. **Fill In Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any additional savings, especially if you expect to need the funds before retirement.

### Final Tips:
- **Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed based on risk tolerance and market conditions.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Individual circumstances vary, so getting personalized advice can be beneficial.

Make sure to adjust this approach based on your specific situation and financial goals!
