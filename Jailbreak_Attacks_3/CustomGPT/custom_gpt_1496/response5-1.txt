When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some key guidelines to think about:

### 1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are usually pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, you'll pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth):** Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions (taxed upon withdrawal), whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, which can be more costly during the accumulation phase.

### 2. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially "free money."
   - Consider contributing to an IRA after reaching the 401(k) match, particularly if you can benefit from tax-free growth with a Roth IRA.

### 3. **Financial Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - Consider your investment time horizon. For long-term growth, equities might be suitable for IRAs and 401(k)s, while taxable accounts could hold more liquid or conservative investments.
   - Align your asset allocation with your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs:**
   - Maintain some liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies since accessing retirement accounts early can lead to penalties.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Max out your 401(k), up to the employer match.**
2. **Contribute to an IRA as per your eligibility (preferably Roth if you qualify).**
3. **Use any remaining funds for a taxable account, focusing on investments that yield favorable tax treatment (like qualified dividends or growth stocks).**

Review your situation regularly, as changes in income, tax laws, and personal circumstances can affect your strategy.
