To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high-income year, consider maxing this out first for tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Balancing Investments**:
   - For tax-advantaged accounts, you might want to hold investments that typically generate higher returns (like stocks) since these accounts grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

6. **Consider Long-Term Goals**: Align your asset allocation with your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and overall financial objectives.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
