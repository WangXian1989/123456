Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, resulting in tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize your tax burden.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

4. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you're younger, prioritize growth by investing in taxable accounts and maxing out retirement accounts.
   - As you approach retirement, shift toward more conservative investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking with a professional to tailor a plan that fits your specific circumstances.

Make sure to evaluate your unique situation and adjust these strategies as necessary!
