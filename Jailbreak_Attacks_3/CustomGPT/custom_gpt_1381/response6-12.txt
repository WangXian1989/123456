I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver treatment options. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common treatment options depending on liver conditions:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**  
   - **Dietary Modifications**: A balanced diet low in fat, sugar, and salt can support liver health.  
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help manage weight and improve metabolic health.  

2. **Medications**  
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, medications can help control the infection.  
   - **Liver Protectants**: Supplements like milk thistle may provide supportive care, but evidence is mixed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**  
   - Routine blood tests and imaging can help track liver function and detect any changes.

4. **Surgery**  
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and a tailored treatment plan.
