Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you're in a higher tax bracket since contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket then. 

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable accounts can be more flexible but are subject to capital gains taxes. Use these for investments you might need to access before retirement or hold investments that produce qualified dividends for lower tax rates.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, stocks or growth funds may go in retirement accounts, while bonds or more conservative investments might be better suited for taxable accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid early withdrawals, which can incur penalties.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - As circumstances change (income, tax laws, financial goals), regularly reassess and adjust your allocation.

Itâ€™s advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your financial situation.
