Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to that match level, as it's essentially free money. Consider the fees and investment options available.

2. **IRA**: If you qualify, max out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth). Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments, especially if you've maxed out the above retirement accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider holding investments long-term to minimize taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Short-term Goals**: Use taxable accounts.
- **Medium-term Goals**: Aim for a mix of taxable and IRAs.
- **Long-term Goals**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first.

### Considerations:
- Assess your current tax bracket and projected retirement income.
- Diversify investments to manage risk.
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help refine this strategy based on your specific situation.
