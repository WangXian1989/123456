Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your age, income level, financial goals, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Before maxing out retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) and that high-interest debts are managed.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement account contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and potential tax advantages if you invest in tax-efficient funds or hold investments long-term.

5. **Diversification and Goals**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Understand how withdrawals from each account type will be taxed in retirement—401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free if certain conditions are met.

7. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
