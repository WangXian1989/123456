When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Ideal for higher contributions due to tax deferrals. Invest in assets that are likely to appreciate over time.
   - **IRA**: Good for long-term growth. Choose investments that may incur higher taxes when sold, like bonds, which are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates. 

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out employer matches in your 401(k) first before contributing to an IRA.
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account type (e.g., $22,500 for 401(k) in 2024, and $6,500 for IRAs).

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan withdrawals based on tax implications. Generally, it’s advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) in retirement.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Age**:
   - Younger investors might prioritize growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement may focus on preserving capital in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio in each account type, adjusting based on the account’s purpose and tax implications.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
