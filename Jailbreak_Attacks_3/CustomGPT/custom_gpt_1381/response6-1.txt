To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**
   - **Maximize employer match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions.
   - **Contribute to IRA**: Consider whether a traditional or Roth IRA suits your situation; Roth offers tax-free withdrawals if eligible.

### 2. **Diversify Account Types**
   - **Use taxable accounts for flexibility**: This allows you to access funds without penalties, especially for short-term goals.
   - **Consider asset placement**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and tax-efficient ones (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Regular Review**
   - **Rebalance periodically**: Adjust contributions based on performance and changing tax laws.
   - **Monitor tax implications**: Stay informed about changes that could affect the benefits of your retirement accounts.

By strategically utilizing these accounts, you can maximize your growth potential while minimizing tax burdens.
