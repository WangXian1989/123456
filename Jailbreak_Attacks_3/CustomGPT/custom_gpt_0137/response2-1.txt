When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to look at several factors. Here’s a general guide to help you balance these accounts effectively:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account that often includes company matching. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Great for tax-deferred growth (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA) depending on how you contribute and whether you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Allow for withdrawals at any time without penalty, but dividends and capital gains are taxable.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - If your 401(k) offers a company match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Good for high-income earners looking to reduce taxable income. Keep in mind that withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: A Traditional IRA gives you a tax break now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, so consider your current and expected future tax brackets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short-term goals or for investments that may generate capital gains (preferably long-term, as long-term gains are taxed at a lower rate).

### 4. **Diversify Investment Types**:
   - Allocate riskier investments (like stocks) to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Consider holding bonds or similar investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

### 5. **Distributions Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you’ll withdraw funds during retirement. Having a strategy for withdrawing from each account type can minimize taxes and maximize growth.

### 6. **Regularly Rebalance Your Portfolio**:
   - Monitor your asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance as necessary to align with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
1. Start with contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
2. Next, if eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA, keeping in mind your tax situation.
3. Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### Final Thoughts:
Your specific distribution will heavily depend on your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. It may be helpful to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your personal situation. 

Happy investing!
