The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts varies based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you haven't maximized your contributions, consider contributing more.
   - **IRA**: Once your 401(k) is maxed or if you have contribution limits, consider putting money into an IRA, especially a Roth IRA if you're eligible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or emerging needs. Since capital gains are taxed at a lower rate, this can be a good place for other investments once retirement accounts are funded.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments according to risk tolerance, ensuring a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on the account type. 

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate liquid fund for immediate needs before aggressively funding investments.

6. **Adjust Based on Retirement Timeline**: As retirement approaches, balance shifts may be necessary for reduced risk.

It's best to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
