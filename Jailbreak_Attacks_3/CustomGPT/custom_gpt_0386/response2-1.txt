When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to achieve any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - After that, consider maxing out your IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for money you might need in the short term, as they offer more flexibility compared to retirement accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments among the accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals, considering factors like expected returns and tax implications.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy** (if you're in retirement):
   - Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Annual Review**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and investment performance.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
