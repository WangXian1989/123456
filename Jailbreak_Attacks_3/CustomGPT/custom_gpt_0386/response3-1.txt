To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Treatment**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Focus on this if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), contributions can be tax-deductible (Traditional) or grow tax-free (Roth). If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing here unless you expect your income to decrease in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need access to before retirement. They offer flexibility but will be subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account, tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Rebalancing**: Periodically rebalance your investments based on performance and changing objectives.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider professional advice for personalized strategies based on your financial situation.

By balancing contributions and understanding tax implications, you can establish a robust investment strategy tailored to your retirement goals.
