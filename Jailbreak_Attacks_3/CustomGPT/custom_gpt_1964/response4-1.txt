To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions up to the limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, fund a traditional or Roth IRA next. Like a 401(k), these accounts offer tax benefits.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - In tax-advantaged accounts, consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments. Consider index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower turnover and capital gains distributions.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield interest income from taxation.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to benefit from favorable capital gains tax rates.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review asset allocation across all accounts to ensure alignment with your financial goals and risk profile.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Different accounts have different rules regarding withdrawals and tax implications.
