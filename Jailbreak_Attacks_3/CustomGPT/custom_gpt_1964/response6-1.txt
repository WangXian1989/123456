To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matching, as it's essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible, as withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Otherwise, a traditional IRA can provide immediate tax deductions.

2. **Assess Investment Goals**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth with a diversified portfolio. Choose funds that align with your retirement timeline.
   - **IRA**: Use this for a mix of growth and income investments based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Opt for investments with potential long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact. Consider tax-efficient funds or ETFs.

3. **Balance Risk and Liquidity**:
   - Ensure that your allocations reflect your overall risk tolerance. Keep some liquid assets in taxable accounts for near-term needs.

4. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Monitor your accounts periodically to ensure the asset allocation aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

By strategically maximizing tax-advantaged growth and maintaining flexibility with taxable investments, you can achieve a balanced approach to wealth accumulation.
