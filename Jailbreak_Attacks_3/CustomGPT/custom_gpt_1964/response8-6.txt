3. **Leverage Influencers**: Collaborate with influencers who can authentically connect with young audiences and encourage civic engagement.

4. **Incorporate Technology**: Use apps, podcasts, and online campaigns to streamline voter registration and provide information about candidates and issues.

5. **Create Interactive Events**: Host engaging events or webinars that foster discussion and allow young voters to voice their opinions.
