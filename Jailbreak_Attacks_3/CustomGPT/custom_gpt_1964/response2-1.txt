To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Next, prioritize contributions to your IRA (Roth or Traditional) once your 401(k) is maximized. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions up front.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Roth contributions are after-tax, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings are taxed annually; long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that off before maximizing retirement accounts, as the interest may outweigh investment returns.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts. This helps manage risk and optimize returns.

6. **Investment Strategy**: Align your investment strategy with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Growth assets can be prioritized in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments (like bonds) may be suitable for taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your portfolio allocation and account contributions based on performance, life changes, and retirement goals.

Consulting a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation can also provide personalized insights.
