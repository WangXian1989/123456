To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maxing out the match, prioritize contributing to your IRA. If you can, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, provided you're eligible.

3. **Contribute to 401(k)**: Once your IRA is maximized or if you're above the Roth IRA income limits, return to your 401(k) and increase contributions to the maximum allowable.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a taxable account to cover unexpected expenses, typically 3-6 months' worth of living expenses.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high capital gains or interest income, as they are taxed differently than tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Invest According to Time Horizon**: Depending on your retirement timeline, tailor your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) to match your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

7. **Review Regularly**: Regularly reassess your distribution strategy as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions evolve.

This approach balances between immediate tax advantages and long-term growth potential while ensuring liquidity for short-term needs.
