Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA to take advantage of tax advantages.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds) in all accounts to reduce risk.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Balancing your accounts may depend on your expected tax rates in retirement.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.

Make sure to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your finances or goals.
