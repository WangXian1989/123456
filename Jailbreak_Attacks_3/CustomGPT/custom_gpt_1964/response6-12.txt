I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver issues that you might discuss with your healthcare provider:

1. **Diet and Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Balanced diet**: Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins to support liver health.
   - **Avoid alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can significantly benefit liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral drugs**: For viral hepatitis, medications like interferons or antiviral medications can be effective.
   - **Liver supplements**: Some supplements may help, but consult your doctor first.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - **Routine blood tests**: To monitor liver function and check for inflammatory markers.
   - **Imaging tests**: Ultrasounds or CT scans to assess liver structure and detect abnormalities.

4. **Advanced Treatments**:
   - **Liver transplant**: In severe cases of liver failure, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.
