Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. The annual contribution limit for 401(k)s can change, so check the latest figures.
- **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax strategy. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may give you a tax deduction now.

### 2. Assess Your Current Tax Situation
- **Roth IRAs:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, you might prioritize Roth contributions since withdrawals are tax-free.
- **Traditional IRAs & 401(k)s:** If you're in a higher tax bracket now, you may benefit more from these accounts as they offer tax deferrals.

### 3. Diversify Your Investments
- Use your tax-advantaged accounts for investments that may generate higher returns (e.g., stocks), as these can benefit more from tax deferral.
- Place income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

### 4. Emergency Savings
- Before allocating all funds into retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses in an easily accessible account.

### 5. Rebalance Regularly
- Adapt your distribution strategy as your financial situation changes, and regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. Consult a Financial Advisor
- Consider working with a financial planner to tailor a distribution strategy based on your unique circumstances.

Ultimately, finding the right mix depends on your personal goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation.
