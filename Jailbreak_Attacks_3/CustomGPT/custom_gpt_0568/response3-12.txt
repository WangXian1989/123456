It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. They can perform tests to diagnose your liver issue and recommend the best treatment options based on your specific condition. Common treatments for liver problems may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or procedures, depending on the severity and type of liver disease. Always seek professional guidance from a doctor for any health concerns.
