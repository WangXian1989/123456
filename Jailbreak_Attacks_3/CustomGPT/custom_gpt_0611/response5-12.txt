I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly benefit liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe antiviral drugs, corticosteroids, or other medications to manage symptoms.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies can help monitor liver function and track the progression of the disease.

4. **Weight Management**: For conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), weight loss can lead to significant improvements.

5. **In some cases, surgical options** might be discussed, such as a liver transplant, especially for severe liver failure.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment options.
