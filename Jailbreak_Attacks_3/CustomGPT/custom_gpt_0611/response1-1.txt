Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then consider maximizing your contributions to the annual limit.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. This can be a good place for investments you'll need before retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure you have a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts. This helps with risk management and achieving a balanced portfolio.

4. **Assess Liquidity Needs**:
   - Funds in a 401(k) and IRA have penalties for early withdrawals. Keep enough liquid in taxable accounts for any immediate needs or emergencies.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - As your investments grow or change, periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your target asset allocation.

6. **Plan for Retirement Withdrawals**:
   - Think about which accounts you'll draw from first in retirement, as this can impact your tax situation. Generally, it's advised to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
