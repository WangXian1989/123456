The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money!

2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth IRA**:
   - If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. A Traditional IRA is beneficial if you want tax-deferred growth and may lower your taxable income now.

3. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement or for shorter-term goals. They can also provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Keep higher-turnover or interest-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you are diversifying across assets within all accounts, not just one. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments.

6. **Rebalancing and Monitoring**:
   - Review your allocations periodically and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consult with a financial advisor for a personalized plan that considers your unique financial situation.

Adjust the distribution based on your age, financial goals, and risk tolerance. Starting this approach early can significantly impact your financial future!
