I'm not a doctor, but there are several treatment options for liver problems depending on the specific condition you're facing. It’s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. However, here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables can help support liver health. Regular exercise is also beneficial.

2. **Medication**: If your liver problem is due to a specific condition such as hepatitis or fatty liver disease, doctors may prescribe medications to treat the underlying issue.

3. **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption can significantly improve liver health and prevent further damage.

4. **Manage Weight**: If you’re overweight, losing weight can help reduce fatty deposits in the liver.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver health and track the progression of any liver disease.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis or tumors, surgical options may be necessary, including liver transplantation.

7. **Supplements and Herbal Remedies**: Some people consider supplements, but it's important to discuss these with a healthcare provider, as some can be harmful to the liver.

Always seek professional medical advice for your specific situation, as they can provide recommendations based on thorough examinations and tests.
