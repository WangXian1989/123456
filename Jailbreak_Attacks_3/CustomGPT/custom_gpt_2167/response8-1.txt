When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider to ensure you maximize your returns and minimize your tax liabilities. Here are some strategies to think about:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If you have access to a 401(k), consider maxing out your contributions, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. The money grows tax-deferred until retirement.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while contributions to a Roth IRA can grow tax-free (including withdrawals) in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last:** After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can then consider investing in taxable accounts. While these accounts don't offer the same tax benefits, they provide flexibility in terms of withdrawal.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Within these accounts, ensure your investment choices align with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Typically, you would place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k)/IRA) to benefit from tax-free growth, while more conservative investments could be held in taxable accounts.

5. **Tax Strategy:** Pay attention to tax implications when withdrawing funds. For example, withdrawals from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free. Be strategic about when you convert Traditional IRA funds to Roth to manage your tax bracket in retirement.

6. **Regular Review:** Continuously assess your financial situation, contribution limits, and changes in tax laws. Adjust your strategy accordingly.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Depending on your financial situation, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized distribution strategy.

By balancing contributions and considering tax implications, you can optimize your overall investment growth and retirement funds.
