Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After taking full advantage of the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). The tax advantages can help your investments grow more efficiently over time.

3. **Fund the 401(k) Further:** If you're eligible, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. This can provide higher contribution limits than IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These provide flexibility in accessing funds without penalties, which can be beneficial for short- to medium-term goals.

5. **Diversification & Asset Allocation:** Ensure you diversify your investments within these accounts, focusing on a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personal circumstances vary, so consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

Make sure to re-evaluate your strategy periodically and adjust as your financial situation changes.
