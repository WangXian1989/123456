To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Emphasize contributions to this account if you are in a higher tax bracket and want to lower your current tax liability. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: For a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, similar to a 401(k), with taxes paid upon withdrawal. A Roth IRA, on the other hand, involves post-tax contributions but allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income (dividends, interest, capital gains) is taxed in the year received, making it less tax-advantageous than retirement accounts. However, these accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If your goal is retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, particularly if you won’t need the funds for several years. For shorter-term goals, a taxable account may be more suitable.
   - Consider your risk tolerance when investing in different accounts; more aggressive investments may suit long-term retirement accounts while more conservative investments may be better for short-term needs in taxable accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. Maximizing contributions to a 401(k) and IRA can provide significant tax advantages and growth potential.

4. **Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit as it’s essentially “free” money.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts maintain a diversified portfolio to reduce risk. You might have different asset allocations in each account based on their tax implications and your overall strategy.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Having a combination of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts allows for greater flexibility in managing your tax liability during retirement years.

Ultimately, the best allocation strategy will depend on your personal financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. You may also want to consult with a financial advisor to construct a tailored plan that suits your needs.
