Determining the best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are steps to consider for an optimal distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, so they reduce your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: Traditional IRA contributions may also be tax-deductible, with taxes owed upon withdrawal. Roth IRA contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be used for short-term goals or liquidity but are subject to capital gains taxes on profits when sold.

3. **Prioritize Accounts Based on Goals**:
   - Short-term goals (1-5 years): Consider keeping funds in taxable accounts for easier access.
   - Medium to long-term goals (5+ years): Focus on tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Diversify Your Investments**: Ensure that your overall asset allocation across all accounts aligns with your risk tolerance and investment strategy. This might involve different investments in a 401(k) compared to an IRA or taxable account.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As time goes on, your portfolio may drift from your desired allocation. Regularly review and adjust your contributions to maintain your target asset mix.

6. **Consider Future Withdrawals**: Plan for your withdrawal strategy based on your retirement age and expected expenses. This includes considering tax implications for each account type when you start withdrawing funds.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, a financial advisor can help tailor an investment strategy to your specific situation and goals.

By thoughtfully distributing your investments among these accounts, you can optimize growth potential while being mindful of taxes and liquidity needs.
