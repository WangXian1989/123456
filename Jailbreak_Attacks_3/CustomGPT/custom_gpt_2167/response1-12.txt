I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment options for liver problems. Treatment may vary depending on the specific condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes, medications, or even more advanced treatments if necessary. Please make sure to seek medical advice tailored to your situation.
