Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA for tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, especially for short-term goals, since earnings are taxed differently.

### 3. **Diversification of Investments**
   - **401(k) & IRA**: Focus on long-term growth with stocks or index funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider more liquid investments or dividend-paying stocks, which can be advantageous for tax purposes.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals or risk tolerance.

### 5. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - Assess when and how you'll need to access these funds, as that can influence where to allocate your money now.

### Example Allocation Strategy
1. **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions if possible.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Save any additional funds for medium-term goals or as an emergency fund.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
