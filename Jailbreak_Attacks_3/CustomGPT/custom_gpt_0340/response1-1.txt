Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Roth IRA**: If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA. This account offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Next, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket. These contributions reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider asset allocation based on risk tolerance, age, and investment goals.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals and keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocations based on market conditions and personal financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice specific to your situation.
