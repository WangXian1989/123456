To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Define your retirement goals and investment timeline, as well as your risk tolerance.

2. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match contributions if available.
   - Consider contributing enough to reach contribution limits, as 401(k)s often have higher contribution limits than IRAs.

3. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Open a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax situation.
   - Contribute up to the limit, prioritizing Roth IRAs if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for funds you may need before retirement.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds, ETFs, or municipal bonds to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Balance your investments according to your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - Generally, place more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA) and more conservative investments in your taxable account to manage taxes on dividends and capital gains.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering any changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

7. **Tax Efficiency**: Withdraw funds from your accounts in a tax-efficient manner in retirement, prioritizing accounts based on their tax implications.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
