Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**  
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**  
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA next, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free and allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**  
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that might generate taxable income or gains, like bonds or actively managed funds. Consider holding long-term investments here to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**  
   - **Risk Tolerance and Age:** Adjust your investment strategy based on your risk tolerance and the number of years until retirement. Younger investors may lean more towards equities, while those closer to retirement might favor more conservative investments.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**  
   - Periodically review your allocations based on performance, changes in income, taxes, and life circumstances.

### Example Breakdown  
- **401(k):** 10-15% to maximize the match.  
- **IRA:** Contribute up to the annual limit, if feasible.  
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any remaining savings, ensuring you consider tax-efficient investments.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation for personalized advice.
