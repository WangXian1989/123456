I'm not a medical professional, but it's important to discuss any liver problems with a healthcare provider. Treatment options may vary depending on the specific liver condition, its severity, and underlying causes. Generally, potential treatment options could include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications to manage symptoms, potentially antiviral medications for viral hepatitis, or in severe cases, procedures or liver transplantation. Please consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment plans.
