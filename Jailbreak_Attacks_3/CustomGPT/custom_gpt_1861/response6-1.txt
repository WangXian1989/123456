Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be influenced by various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Otherwise, a traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now.

2. **Balance Growth and Liquidity:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use this for investments you might need to access before retirement or for goals with shorter time horizons. This allows for flexibility and avoids penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

3. **Investment Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Higher-risk investments can go into your tax-advantaged accounts since they grow tax-free or tax-deferred. Consider bonds or safer assets in taxable accounts to minimize the impact of capital gains taxes.

4. **Long-Term Growth:**
   - Focus on aggressive growth in 401(k) and IRA, as taxes are deferred or eliminated. Maintain a conservative approach in taxable accounts, especially as you approach financial goals.

By strategically allocating funds based on these considerations, you can optimize your overall financial health and retirement readiness. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized recommendations based on your unique situation.
