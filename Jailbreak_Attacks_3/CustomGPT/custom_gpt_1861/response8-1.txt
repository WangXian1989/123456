Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains can be subject to taxes annually. Consider using these accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds or long-term investments.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Across all accounts, diversify your investments by including a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Contribute Max to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Try to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA, Roth IRA) before putting money into taxable accounts.

5. **Think About Your Withdrawal Strategy**: As you plan for retirement, consider how you will withdraw from your accounts. You may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow tax-deferred for longer.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances can significantly alter recommendations. It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan.

Every situation is unique, so adjust this general advice to fit your individual financial goals and circumstances.
