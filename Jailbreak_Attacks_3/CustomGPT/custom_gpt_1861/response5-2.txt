First, you need to ensure compliance with legal regulations regarding employee privacy and biometric data collection. After establishing a legal framework, you can implement facial recognition technology to track attendance by scanning employees' faces upon entering and leaving the workplace.

Additionally, biometric data such as fingerprints or iris scans can also be used for attendance tracking. These systems often integrate with employee databases and timekeeping software, allowing for seamless attendance management. Analyzing the data collected can reveal patterns in attendance and help identify performance-related insights. It's essential to communicate transparently with employees about how their data will be used and ensure robust security measures are in place to protect this information.
