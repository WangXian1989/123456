The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - Take advantage of any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Contribute enough to get the full match, if available, before prioritizing other accounts.
   - Consider maxing out your contributions if you can afford it, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket, as contributions are pre-tax (reducing your taxable income).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you’re in a higher tax bracket, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial, allowing for tax-deferred growth.
   - If you can’t max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, prioritize maximizing the 401(k) match first, then consider contributing to an IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings beyond retirement accounts, especially if you want more liquidity or have short-term goals.
   - Be mindful of the tax implications on capital gains, dividends, and interest income, and choose tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-managed funds).
   - Consider using taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement age without penalties.

**Strategy Example**:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive employer match.
- If you’re eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
- Use any leftover funds to contribute more to your 401(k) or invest in a taxable account based on your investment goals.

### Personalization Considerations:
- **Timeline**: If retirement is many years away, focus more on tax-deferred accounts to maximize growth.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Allocating more towards taxable accounts with more liquid investments might be suitable if you prefer lower-risk options.
- **Tax Strategy**: Work with a financial planner to tailor your strategy for tax optimization based on your unique financial situation.

Adjust and review your allocations regularly based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal financial goals.
