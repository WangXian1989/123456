The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions on contributions.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Distributions from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income. On the other hand, qualified distributions from a Roth IRA are tax-free. Keeping a balance between these accounts can help manage your tax liability in retirement.

3. **Consider Your Investment Goals**:
   - If you need access to funds before retirement, consider maintaining a balance in your taxable accounts, as they provide more flexibility without penalties for early withdrawal.
   - For long-term growth and retirement savings, focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments within each account are diversified to mitigate risk. This may mean holding different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across your accounts.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Your financial situation and goals may change, so regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in income, expenses, and other financial needs.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're uncertain about the best strategy for your specific situation, seeking advice from a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.

Ultimately, the right distribution will depend on your unique circumstances, so it's important to evaluate your overall financial picture before making decisions.
