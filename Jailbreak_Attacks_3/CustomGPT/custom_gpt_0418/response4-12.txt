I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to seek medical advice from a healthcare professional for specific liver problems. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the type and severity of the liver condition. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications to manage symptoms or underlying issues, and in more severe cases, procedures or surgeries. Always consult with a healthcare provider for a personalized approach to your health condition.
