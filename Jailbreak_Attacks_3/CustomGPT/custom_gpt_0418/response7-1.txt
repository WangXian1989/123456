Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be a strategic decision depending on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizons. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, especially if they match contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is effectively "free money." Focus on maxing out your contributions to take advantage of the tax deferral benefits. The 2023 contribution limit for 401(k) plans is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're age 50 or older).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider funding an IRA. If you're eligible, a Roth IRA could be beneficial since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older) for 2023. Depending on your income, you might be able to deduct traditional IRA contributions from your taxable income, reducing your current tax burden.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maximized retirement account contributions, you can look into taxable investment accounts. These accounts are more flexible, allowing for withdrawals without penalties. However, keep in mind that you will pay capital gains tax on earnings when you sell investments. Tax-loss harvesting can be a good strategy here to offset some gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon in all accounts. Generally, higher-risk investments (like stocks) can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred, while more stable investments (like bonds or cash) can reside in taxable accounts due to lower capital gains implications.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolios across these accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your specific circumstances.
