The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in Your 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough** to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize IRAs**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Consider contributing if you can deduct contributions based on your income. This can lower your taxable income now.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth contributions for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that may generate lower capital gains tax, like index funds or ETFs.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Ensure a diverse asset allocation tailored to your risk tolerance. Typically, stocks are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to their potential growth.

### 5. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**
   - For short-term needs, keep funds in taxable accounts for easier access and flexibility. For long-term, prioritize retirement accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Annually**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Summary:
1. **Max out contributions** to your 401(k) to receive any employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** based on existing tax benefits and future expectations.
3. **Fill up taxable accounts last**, focusing on investments with favorable tax implications.
