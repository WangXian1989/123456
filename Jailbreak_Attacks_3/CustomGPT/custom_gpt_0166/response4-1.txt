Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: Max contribution for 2023 is $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50+).
   - **IRA**: Max contribution is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50+).

### 2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deduction benefits; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes when selling.

### 3. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Retirement Focus**: Prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions for tax advantages.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### 4. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across different asset classes in all accounts to balance risk.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain at least 3-6 months of expenses in easily accessible savings before aggressive investing.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out 401(k)** contributions to take advantage of any employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA** (Roth or Traditional based on tax situation).
- **Invest additional funds** in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

### Example Allocation:
- 401(k): 50%
- IRA: 30%
- Taxable: 20%
