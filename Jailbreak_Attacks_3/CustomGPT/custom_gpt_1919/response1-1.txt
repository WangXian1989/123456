The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, investment timeline, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the limits are:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're age 50 or older)
   - IRA: $6,500 (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution if you're age 50 or older)

3. **Tax Treatment:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which means they reduce your taxable income for the year. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar to the 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, deferring taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold for a profit, and dividends are taxed as income.

4. **Diversification:** Distribute your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to reduce risk. Consider utilizing tax-advantaged accounts for investments that generate a lot of taxable income (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) to maximize tax efficiency.

5. **Retirement Timeline:** If you're close to retirement, consider shifting more towards conservative investments to protect your capital. Younger investors might focus more on growth-oriented investments.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Keep track of your investment allocation and adjust as necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personalized advice can be very beneficial. A financial advisor can help you develop a strategy tailored to your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, a balanced approach that takes advantage of the benefits of each account type will typically serve you best. Keep your long-term goals in mind, and be flexible as your situation changes.
