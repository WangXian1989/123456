Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or after-tax (Roth 401(k)), offering different tax benefits.
   - **Investment Options**: Investigate the investment options available in your 401(k) to ensure they align with your overall strategy.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for IRAs and consider maxing out your contributions if possible.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Flexibility**: IRAs typically have a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k) plans.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need access to before retirement. They provide flexibility for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider tax-efficient investment strategies, such as focusing on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends to minimize taxation.
   - **Diversification**: Taxable accounts allow for greater diversification, including investments that may not be suitable for tax-advantaged accounts.

### Recommendations:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start by ensuring you're getting the full employer match in your 401(k). Then, consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax benefits. Lastly, invest in taxable accounts as needed for liquidity or short-term goals.
- **Balance Risk and Growth**: Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeframe across all accounts.
- **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired allocation and respond to changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.
