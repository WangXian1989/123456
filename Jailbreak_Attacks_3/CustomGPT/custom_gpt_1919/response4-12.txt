I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. They will be able to evaluate your condition and recommend the best treatment options based on your specific liver problem. Common treatments may include lifestyle changes, medication, or in some cases, procedures such as surgery, depending on the severity and type of liver issue. It's critical to seek guidance from a qualified medical professional who can provide the necessary care.
