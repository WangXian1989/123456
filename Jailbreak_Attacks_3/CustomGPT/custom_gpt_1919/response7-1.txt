The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, investment options, and your expected timeline for retirement. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially "free money" for your retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA** contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on your contributions or the investment gains until you withdraw the money in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts** do not provide tax advantages, and you will pay taxes on any realized gains, dividends, and interest earned.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This can help manage risk and enhance potential returns.

4. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency fund and are managing high-interest debt effectively.

5. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Your investment strategy may vary based on your age and when you plan to retire. Younger investors might focus more on growth in stocks, while those nearing retirement might want to preserve capital and seek income.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best distribution for your specific circumstances, consider consulting with a financial advisor. They can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals. 

In summary, a balanced approach that includes maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts while also considering your overall financial picture and goals is often the most effective strategy.
