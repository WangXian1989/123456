Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
- **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if financially feasible.
- **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth may be advantageous.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation:
- **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider utilizing taxable accounts for additional investments. Keep in mind that investments in these accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications.

### 3. Diversification of Investments:
- **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified asset allocation across all accounts that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. This may involve a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with your objectives.

### 4. Withdrawal Strategy in Retirement:
- Plan how and when you'll withdraw money from each account. Generally, tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRAs) should be tapped into later, allowing them to grow tax-free for as long as possible.

### Summary:
- **Prioritize employer matches and tax-advantaged contributions.**
- **Consider tax efficiency when investing in taxable accounts.**
- **Diversify and rebalance based on risk tolerance and goals.**
- **Strategize withdrawals to maximize tax benefits in retirement.**

These steps can help you create a balanced approach to investing your money across these different types of accounts. It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual circumstances.
