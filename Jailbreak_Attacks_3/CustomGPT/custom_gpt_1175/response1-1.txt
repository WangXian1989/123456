Distributing your money effectively between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some considerations to help you make an informed decision:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it—it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing out contributions if you can.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Tax Treatment:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose one based on your current versus future tax expectations.
   - **Backdoor Roth IRA:** If you're higher income and can't contribute directly to a Roth IRA, consider a backdoor contribution.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity:** Money in taxable accounts is more accessible without penalties. It’s good for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Allocating:**
   - Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially if there's a match.
   - If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax advantages.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate lower capital gains or for savings towards imminent expenses.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified to manage risk effectively.

6. **Rebalance Annually:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing personal goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your needs.
