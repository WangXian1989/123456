The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute the maximum allowable amount, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket. Consider a Roth 401(k) if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** If you have additional funds, consider contributing to an IRA after maxing out your 401(k). A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** 
   - Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in a taxable brokerage account. This provides liquidity and flexibility, allowing you to access funds before retirement without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation:** 
   - Consider the types of investments in each account. Generally, you may want to place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to take advantage of tax-free growth, while keeping more stable investments (bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

5. **Monitor Tax Implications:** 
   - Be aware of capital gains taxes and dividends in your taxable accounts, and aim for tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize taxable events.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** 
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance, risk tolerance, and changes in your financial situation.

Ultimately, it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial planner to tailor a strategy that aligns with your unique circumstances.
