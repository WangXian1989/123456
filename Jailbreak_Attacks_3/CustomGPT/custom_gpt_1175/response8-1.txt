The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and personal circumstances. Here are some general guidelines to consider when making your decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Both of these accounts offer tax advantages. Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA are often tax-deductible, while qualified withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Options**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k). Contributions to these accounts are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for more flexible investments. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes on selling investments. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize your tax burden.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified. This reduces overall risk and can promote more stable returns over time.

4. **Liquidity Needs**: Decide how much money you might need access to in the short term. A taxable account allows for easier access to funds without penalties, as compared to retirement accounts, which may incur fees or taxes if accessed early.

5. **Investment Horizon**: Consider your time frame for each account. Retirement accounts are generally for long-term growth, while taxable accounts can hold more short-term investments since there are no penalties for withdrawals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and periodically adjust your allocations in each account to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax laws and individual financial situations, it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, the ideal distribution will depend on your unique financial objectives and situations. Consider creating a plan that balances growth with liquidity, and continually reassess your allocations as your circumstances and the financial landscape change.
