Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors: your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA for tax advantages.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you max out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This offers flexibility for withdrawals and capital gains.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments since withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess your asset allocation across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A personalized approach can help optimize your specific tax situation and long-term goals.
