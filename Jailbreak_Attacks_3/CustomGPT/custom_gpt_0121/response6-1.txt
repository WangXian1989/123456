To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **401(k)**: Choose a mix of stock and bond funds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA**: Use this for more volatile investments if youâ€™re comfortable, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free (for Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Keep tax implications in mind for when you plan to access funds. Prioritize withdrawals from taxable accounts first in retirement if it allows tax efficiency.

4. **Periodic Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly assess your investment allocations across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

Implementing these strategies can help optimize your savings for both growth and tax efficiency.
