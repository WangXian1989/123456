Iâ€™m not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Improving diet, losing weight, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, specific medications can help manage symptoms or underlying issues.
3. **Nutritional Support**: Supplements may be recommended, especially for conditions like fatty liver disease.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups to track liver function and disease progression.
5. **Advanced Therapies**: In severe cases, options like liver transplantation may be considered.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.
