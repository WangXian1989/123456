To optimize your investment strategy and distribution of funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals, including retirement, home purchase, or other major expenses.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are taxed at capital gains rates, which could be lower than ordinary income tax rates depending on your income.

3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match for the 401(k), contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”this is essentially "free money."
   - Max out contributions to IRAs if eligible and if you have additional funds after 401(k) contributions.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy Planning**:
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from your taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer. Factor in tax brackets as well.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust as needed based on performance, changing goals, or shifts in market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your individual circumstances.
