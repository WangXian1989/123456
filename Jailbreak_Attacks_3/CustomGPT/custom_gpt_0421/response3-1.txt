To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to meet any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high contribution limit and employer matching, prioritize this account.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with lower capital gains taxes or for short-term savings, as dividends and gains are taxed annually.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider using tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds) and holding high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, plan the order of withdrawals to minimize taxesâ€”typically starting with taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your overall investment strategy and tax efficiency. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
