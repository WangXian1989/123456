The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general framework for balancing the three types of accounts:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers higher contribution limits and potential employer matching. Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Can be a traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals in retirement). 
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These provide flexibility with investments but are subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match—it's essentially free money.
   - **Consider Tax Implications:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions (IRA or 401(k)) for tax-free growth.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Different accounts can support various investment strategies. For instance, hold more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities, and growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.

### 4. **Balance Contributions**
   - Aim for a balanced allocation. You might prioritize maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before allocating significant sums to taxable accounts. A common approach is:
     - **50-70% in retirement accounts** (401(k) and IRA)
     - **30-50% in taxable accounts**

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Your financial situation, goals, and the investment landscape can change. Revisit your distribution strategy annually or after significant life changes (job change, marriage, etc.).

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
