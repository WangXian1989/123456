Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money!). Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are subject to capital gains taxes, so keep investments with high turnover or interest income here. Use these accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Make sure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to reduce risk.

4. **Rebalance as Necessary:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you’re unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.

Focus on your long-term goals, and adjust as your situation changes!
