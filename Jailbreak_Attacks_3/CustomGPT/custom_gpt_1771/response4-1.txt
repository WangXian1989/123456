To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. This reduces your taxable income and lets your investment grow tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferred growth. If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains (like stocks) rather than interest income (like bonds), as long-term capital gains are taxed more favorably.

2. **Investment Types**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments expected to produce lower tax liabilities, ideal for holding tax-efficient funds.

3. **Retirement Goals**:
   - Assess your retirement timeline. If you’re far from retirement, lean more into 401(k) and IRA contributions. If nearing retirement, adjust focus on accessing funds without penalties.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account type and maximize your contributions to take full advantage of tax benefits.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Tax implications vary; for instance, 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to spread risk and maintain balance in your portfolio.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific needs and circumstances.
