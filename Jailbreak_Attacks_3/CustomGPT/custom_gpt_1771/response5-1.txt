(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are a few strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income in the short term. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for short-term goals or for assets you may need access to before retirement. Gains are taxed, but tax-loss harvesting can help manage tax liability.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific needs.

1. **First Things First**: Hit up your 401(k) for that sweet employer match. Donâ€™t leave free money on the tableâ€”itâ€™s like refusing a free drink at a bar!

2. **Tax Strategy**: 
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred heaven! Youâ€™ll save on taxes now, but Uncle Sam is waiting on withdrawals. If you're in a lower tax bracket now, this is golden.
   - **Roth IRA**: Put in after-tax money for those tax-free withdrawals laterâ€”great if you think your tax rate will skyrocket when you retire.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are for flexibility. Want to pull cash before retirement? Go for it. Just be ready to face taxes on gainsâ€”hello, capital gains tax! 

3. **Diversify like a Boss**: Mix up your investments to dodge wild market swings. Stocks, bonds, cryptoâ€”find your balance based on how much risk you can take without losing sleep.

4. **Keep it Fresh**: Regularly check and tweak your allocations. Investing is like dieting; you gotta adjust based on how things are going!
