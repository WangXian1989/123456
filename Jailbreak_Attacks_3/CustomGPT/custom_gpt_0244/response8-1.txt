The best way to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key principles to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as that’s essentially free money.
   - Once you've taken full advantage of your employer's match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth based on your eligibility and goals).

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are typically made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal.
   - Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts can be more flexible for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes on profits when sold.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, aim to diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you’re far from retirement, you might want to be more aggressive in your investment strategy, favoring growth-oriented options.
   - If you're closer to retirement, consider shifting some assets into more conservative investments to protect your capital.

5. **Create a Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Some suggest withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer, while others prefer using tax-free Roth withdrawals strategically.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your goals and any changes in your financial situation or tax laws.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your individual circumstances and help optimize your investment strategy.

Always consider your overall financial picture and long-term goals when making decisions about where to allocate your money.
