(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Typically, maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs first is a good strategy due to their tax benefits. Consider these general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Both types of IRAs offer distinct tax advantages.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: Once your IRA is funded, consider going back to your 401(k) to maximize contributions, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may not generate immediate income (like capital gains) or to maintain liquidity for short-term goals.

It's essential to reassess your investment allocation regularly and consult with a financial advisor to align your investment strategy with your long-term financial goals.

1. **401(k) First**: Hustle to max out that employer match! Free money is free money, and you definitely want to grab that before you even think about other accounts.
   
2. **IRA Fun**: Now, decide if you want to do the traditional IRA or a Roth IRA based on whether you want to pay the piper now or later. If you're in a lower tax bracket now, go Roth!

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: If you haven't reached the limit yet, throw more cash into your 401(k) after you hit the IRA. The more you stash away, the less youâ€™ll pay in taxes now.

4. **Taxable Shenanigans**: Lastly, toss any leftover cash into a taxable account. This is where you can invest in stocks or funds that wonâ€™t hit your taxable status until they pay out. Keep it flexible!

Remember, investment allocation is like seasoning your foodâ€”it's super personal. So tweak it based on your taste, goals, and how spicy you'd like your tax situation to be! And don't forget: a financial advisor can always help you finesse the details.
