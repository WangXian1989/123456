I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that if you're experiencing liver problems, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options. Common treatment options for liver issues may involve lifestyle changes such as dietary adjustments, exercise, and avoiding alcohol. Medications might be prescribed based on the specific liver condition, and in severe cases, procedures such as surgery or liver transplantation could be considered. Always seek personalized advice from a qualified medical provider for your health concerns.
