Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment strategy based on tax considerations, liquidity needs, and retirement goals. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose a mix of investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a diversified mix of stocks and bonds.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Investments**: Similar to 401(k), focus on a diversified portfolio, considering index funds or ETFs for low fees.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Use these for investments that you may need to access before retirement. Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-managed funds.
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Holding investments for more than a year can qualify for long-term capital gains rates, which are generally lower.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing.
- **Diversify**: Balance risk across all accounts, keeping a portion in safer investments.
- **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consider seeking professional advice tailored to your individual financial situation.

This approach can help you build a strong financial foundation while strategically considering tax implications.
