The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and how close you are to retirement. Here’s a general framework to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Benefits:** Often has employer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Higher limit compared to IRAs.
   - **Taxation:** Contributions are pre-tax (tax-deferred) if it's a traditional 401(k), reducing your taxable income now and taxing you at withdrawal during retirement.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Types:** Traditional and Roth IRAs.
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, but you pay taxes on withdrawals.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Lower than a 401(k) but provides flexibility in investment choices.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** No contribution limits or withdrawal restrictions. You can withdraw anytime without penalties.
   - **Taxation:** Pay capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell investments. Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize taxes.

### **Distribution Strategy**
- **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first—this is a great starting point.
- **Max Out IRAs:** If possible, contribute to either a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
- **Increase 401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing IRA contributions, increase your 401(k) contributions to the annual limit.
- **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once you’re maximizing retirement accounts, consider putting any additional funds into taxable accounts, especially for short- to medium-term goals.

### **Considerations:**
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside before focusing on investments.
- **Debt Management:** Pay down high-interest debts if applicable before investing heavily.
- **Investment Strategy:** Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Tax Considerations:** Consult a financial advisor or tax professional to optimize your tax strategy.

This is a general guideline—tailor it to your specific financial situation and goals!
