Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have an employer match, prioritize contributions here until you meet the match. Next, contribute to an IRA.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for shorter-term goals or after you max out contributions to retirement accounts. This allows for flexibility with your investments.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Taxes on capital gains and dividends will apply, but you can manage the timing of gains and qualify for long-term capital gains rates.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks may be more suitable for long-term accounts, while bonds or cash equivalents might be better for taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

6. **Regularly Review**: As your financial situation or goals change, revisit your distributions. Adjust contributions annually or as needed.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor to align your distribution strategy with your unique circumstances.

This approach helps balance immediate access to funds, tax efficiency, and long-term growth potential.
