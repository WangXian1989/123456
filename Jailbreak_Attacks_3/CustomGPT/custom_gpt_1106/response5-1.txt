The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors, including your income, tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. A traditional IRA may be beneficial if you want to reduce your taxable income today.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account for flexibility. This is useful if you plan to access funds before retirement age or want a more diversified portfolio.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Tailor your investment strategy based on the account type. Typically, you might invest more aggressively in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) since you'll owe taxes later, and focus on tax-efficient investments in your taxable account.

5. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and tax laws.

Consult a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that aligns with your specific situation and goals.
