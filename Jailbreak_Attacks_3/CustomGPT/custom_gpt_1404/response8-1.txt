Distributing your money across different accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA**: Maximize contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that may generate taxable income (like bonds) or for money you may need to access before retirement age without penalties. 

**Considerations**:
- **Tax Implications**: Understand the tax impact of gains in each account type. Long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.
  
- **Liquidity Needs**: Keep in mind your need for accessible funds. Taxable accounts allow for more flexibility.

- **Investment Strategy**: Diversify investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
