The best approach to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on a few key factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Diversify Based on Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts should be used for investments that are likely to generate long-term capital gains (which are taxed at a lower rate) or municipal bonds (which are usually tax-exempt), since interest from these investments is taxed at your ordinary income rate.
   - **Asset Location:** Place higher-growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and consider holding income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

3. **Adjust Based on Financial Goals:**
   - If you plan to retire early or have short-term needs, prioritize liquidity with your taxable account.
   - For long-term growth, focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA.

Remember, itâ€™s wise to regularly reassess your investment strategy as the market changes and as you reach different life stages. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
