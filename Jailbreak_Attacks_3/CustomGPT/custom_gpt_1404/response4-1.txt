To effectively distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Are you saving for retirement, a major purchase, or something else? 

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: A tax-advantaged retirement plan offered by an employer. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, and thereâ€™s potential for employer matching.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Another retirement savings option that can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not offer tax advantages. However, they provide flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.

3. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

4. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA since they offer tax benefits. Aim to maximize contributions to these accounts before allocating excess funds to taxable accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts may be beneficial if you need access to funds before retirement, but they come with capital gains tax on selling investments. Balance high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens.

7. **Adjust Based on Life Changes**: Your financial situation and goals can change, so adjust your allocations as needed, especially with major life events like marriage, children, or a new job.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategy, consider speaking to a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

Following these steps can help you create a balanced investment strategy that aligns with your financial objectives.
