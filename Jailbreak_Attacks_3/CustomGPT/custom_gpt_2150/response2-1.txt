Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals).
   - Aim to max out contributions to these accounts before investing heavily in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate high taxable income (e.g., bonds) or for strategies like tax-loss harvesting.
   - Favor holding long-term investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts, as they benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Assess Your Investment Timeline**
   - If youâ€™re saving for retirement (long-term), focus more on tax-deferred accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals, prioritize liquidity and accessibility through taxable accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and market conditions.

### General Allocation Suggestion
- **401(k)**: Fund enough to meet employer match, then increase contributions.
- **IRA**: Maximize contributions if eligible.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional savings for flexibility and liquidity.

### Summary
Tailor these strategies to fit your personal financial situation. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
