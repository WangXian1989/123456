Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing growth, tax efficiency, and liquidity. Here's a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If your employer offers a Roth 401(k), consider your current vs. future tax rates.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA (pre-tax) or Roth IRA (post-tax). Roth IRAs can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds and ETFs, to minimize capital gains tax.

### 3. **Diversify Asset Allocation**:
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks generally offer higher growth potential but come with more volatility, while bonds are typically more stable but offer lower returns.

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review your allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance. Consider market fluctuations that may affect your investment distribution.

### 5. **Stay Informed on Tax Implications**:
   - Be conscious of how withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts will affect your tax situation in retirement. Strategizing withdrawals can help minimize taxes.

### Conclusion:
A well-rounded strategy combines maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, understanding tax efficiency, and ensuring your investments align with your long-term goals. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
