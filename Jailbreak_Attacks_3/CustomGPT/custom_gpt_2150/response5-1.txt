Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to either a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
  
### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs). Pay attention to capital gains and dividend distributions, as these are taxable.

### 3. **Diversify Across Accounts:**
   - Keep growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Hold bonds or income-generating investments in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance as needed to maintain your target risk profile.

### 5. **Assess Future Needs:**
   - Consider your anticipated withdrawal timelines since 401(k) and IRAs have penalties for early withdrawal if under 59½, while taxable accounts do not.

### Example Allocation:
- Max out 401(k) contributions first for employer match.
- Then, contribute to an IRA, focusing on Roth if younger and in a lower tax bracket.
- Finally, invest extra funds in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

It's always wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
