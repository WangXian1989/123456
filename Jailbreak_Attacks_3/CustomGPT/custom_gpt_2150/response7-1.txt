Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **Traditional Accounts (401(k) & Traditional IRA):** Contributions are often tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You pay capital gains taxes on any realized gains, but you can utilize tax-loss harvesting.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Goals:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus more on tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth since they have tax benefits that compound over time.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement, as they offer more liquidity.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across all three account types to spread risk.
   - Hold more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts before aggressively investing.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of salary (maximizing match).
- **Traditional/Roth IRA:** Full contribution limit ($6,000 or $7,000 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any remaining savings or what’s above retirement contributions.

### Final Thoughts:
It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your unique circumstances. Regularly revisiting your plan ensures it remains aligned with your life goals and financial situation.
