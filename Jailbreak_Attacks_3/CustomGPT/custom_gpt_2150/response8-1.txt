Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions when possible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for potential immediate tax deductions. 

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts. They offer flexibility and can be beneficial for short-term needs or if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket post-retirement.

3. **Consider Investment Types**:
   - Place **high growth** investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax on capital gains.
   - Keep **income-generating** investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

4. **Diversification and Risk Management**:
   - Diversify within each account according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your allocations to ensure they still align with your financial goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation.
