(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to receive the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:** 
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Trad IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Keep some cash in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs.

4. **Long-Term Growth:** Once your tax-advantaged accounts are funded, consider investing additional funds in taxable accounts to maintain flexibility and liquidity.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation.

1. **401(k) First:** Shove as much as you can into your 401(k) up to the company match. Think of it as your foundational investment â€“ free money, baby! 

2. **IRA Time:** Next, hit up an IRA. If you can rock a Roth, do it! It's tax-free growth, which is like finding a hidden stash of money while cleaning out your attic. If you need a tax break now, go for Traditional.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Fun:** Then stash some cash into taxable accounts for flexibility. This is your rainy day fund for when life throws curveballs at you, like needing a new car or those surprise vacation plans!

4. **Keep an Eye on It:** And donâ€™t forget to keep checking in on your investments. Just like youâ€™d check the fridge before deciding on snack options, revisit your portfolio regularly to make sure it still makes sense!
