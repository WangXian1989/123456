Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Contribute to a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. 
   - Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, offering immediate tax benefits.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - After maximizing any matches, consider increasing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket. The contributions reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds in a taxable account. This provides flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, although you will pay capital gains taxes on earnings.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, consider holding more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where your earnings can grow without being taxed until withdrawal, while using taxable accounts for more conservative investments (like bonds) that may generate taxable income. 

6. **Rebalancing and Flexibility**: Regularly review your portfolio allocation and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your goals.

It's always wise to consider consulting with a financial advisor for a personalized strategy.
