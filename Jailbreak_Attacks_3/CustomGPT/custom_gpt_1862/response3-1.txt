Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**

   - **401(k):**
     - Employer-sponsored.
     - Pre-tax contributions grow tax-deferred.
     - Potential employer match.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
     - Offers tax advantages.
     - Traditional IRA: Contributions may be tax-deductible; growth is tax-deferred.
     - Roth IRA: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - No tax advantages.
     - Flexibility for withdrawals.
     - Capital gains taxes apply on profits from sales.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**

1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Fund an IRA:**
   - If eligible, prioritize funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions, depending on your tax bracket and future expectations.

3. **Max Out 401(k):**
   - After fully funding your IRA, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions next.

4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments once retirement accounts are maximized. Consider this for short-term savings or if you want liquidity.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**

- **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** 
  - Focus on higher growth investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred and tax-free accounts (401(k) and Roth IRA) to maximize tax benefits.
  
- **Taxable Accounts:** 
  - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) that generate less taxable income.

### 4. **Adjust Over Time**

- **Review Asset Allocation:**
  - Periodically review your investment allocation across accounts to maintain your desired risk level.
  
- **Consider Life Changes:**
  - Adjust contributions based on changes in income, employment status, or financial goals.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**

- A professional can provide personalized strategies based on your entire financial picture.

### Example Distribution Strategy

- Work through the following:
  1. **401(k):** 15% of your salary (to obtain the full employer match).
  2. **Roth IRA:** $6,500 (or whatever the maximum contribution limit is).
  3. **401(k):** Increase to the maximum allowable contribution.
  4. **Taxable account:** Any surplus after maximizing the above.

This structured approach should help you build a well-rounded investment portfolio while maximizing tax advantages and retirement savings.
