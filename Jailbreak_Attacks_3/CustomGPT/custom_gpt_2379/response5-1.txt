Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in accounts for shorter-term goals or if you anticipate needing liquidity. Focus on tax-efficient investments (index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: 401(k) and traditional IRA grow tax-deferred. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Assess Your Investment Timeline**
   - Long-term growth can be prioritized in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Shorter-term needs may be better served through taxable accounts, as you avoid penalties for early withdrawals in retirement accounts.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds) across all accounts for a balanced portfolio, keeping in mind the unique properties and rules of each account type.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Changes**
   - Regularly review your allocations as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions evolve. 

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
