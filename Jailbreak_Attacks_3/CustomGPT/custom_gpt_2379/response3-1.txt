The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred; focus on maximizing contributions here first.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: If you can, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be preferable.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need before retirement or for investments that may benefit from favorable long-term capital gains tax treatment.

3. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings (3-6 months' worth of expenses) before heavily investing.

4. **Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - The younger you are, the more you might favor growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA. Consider shifting to more conservative investments as you near retirement.

5. **Diversification**: 
   - Across all accounts, ensure diversification to manage risk while aiming for your desired returns.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: 
   - Periodically review and adjust the distributions and allocations based on changing personal circumstances or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide insights based on current tax laws and investment strategies.

By following these guidelines, you can develop a balanced approach to your retirement savings across different account types.
