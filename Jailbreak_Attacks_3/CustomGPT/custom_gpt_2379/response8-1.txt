Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, based on eligibility and future tax expectations.

### 2. **Focus on Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These can be used for savings goals that are shorter-term. Keep investments that generate capital gains (like stocks) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Use a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account for proper diversification.
   - Consider your investment timeline: longer timelines allow for more risk in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Manage Withdrawals**
   - During retirement, plan withdrawals strategically. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation and contribution strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Consider Professional Advice
- Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
