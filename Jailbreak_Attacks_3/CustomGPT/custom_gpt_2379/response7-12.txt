2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider can help monitor liver function and adjust treatment as necessary.

4. **Managing Underlying Conditions:**
   - Conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol should be managed effectively to minimize liver strain.

5. **Supplements:**
   - Some may benefit from vitamin E or milk thistle, but always consult a doctor before starting any supplements.

6. **Avoiding Toxins:**
   - Limit exposure to chemicals and toxins that can harm the liver.
