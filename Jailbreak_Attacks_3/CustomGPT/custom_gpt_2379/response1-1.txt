Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions upfront.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax treatment to a 401(k) depending on the type.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax, but they allow for more flexible withdrawals.

4. **Investment Goals and Timeline**: 
   - Allocate more to retirement accounts if your goal is long-term retirement funding.
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals, as they offer more liquidity without penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance across all accounts, but remember that retirement accounts can afford more risk since they’re for long-term growth.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation with a professional who can assess your needs and adjust your plan accordingly.

This balanced approach can help optimize your tax advantages while ensuring you meet your financial goals efficiently.
