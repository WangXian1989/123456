Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### Î± Traditional Approach
1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Fund your IRA to the annual limit if you can. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you qualify.
   - **Diversify Tax Treatment**: A Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments that benefit from long-term capital gains rates.
   - **Liquidity**: Keep emergency funds and short-term savings in these accounts for easy access without penalties.

### Î© Optimized Approach
