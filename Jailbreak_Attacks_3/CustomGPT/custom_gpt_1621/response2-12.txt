I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about common liver problems and treatment options. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized advice. Here are some common liver issues and their treatment options:

1. **Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD/NASH)**:
   - Lifestyle changes: Weight loss, healthy diet, and regular exercise.
   - Medications: Depending on severity, medications like insulin-sensitizing agents or vitamin E might be prescribed.
   - Managing associated conditions: Control diabetes, cholesterol, and blood pressure.

2. **Hepatitis**:
   - Viral hepatitis (A, B, C): Antiviral medications for chronic B and C; supportive care for A.
   - Autoimmune hepatitis: Corticosteroids or immunosuppressants.

3. **Cirrhosis**:
   - Treat underlying cause: Address hepatitis, alcohol abuse, or bile duct problems.
   - Manage complications: Diuretics for fluid retention, medications for portal hypertension.

4. **Liver Cancer**:
   - Surgery: If localized, surgical resection or liver transplant may be options.
   - Ablation therapies: Techniques to destroy cancer cells.
   - Chemotherapy or targeted therapy.

5. **Liver Transplantation**:
   - For end-stage liver disease or liver cancer not treatable by other means.

6. **Regular Monitoring**:
