The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - After receiving the match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) as these accounts offer tax advantages.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account. For 2024, the 401(k) contribution limit is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you prefer to reduce your taxable income now, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) may be more beneficial.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Distribute your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to manage risk and optimize returns. 

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments in accounts with a longer time horizon (like your 401(k) and IRA) and more conservative investments in your taxable accounts if you may need access to those funds sooner.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - Think about how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Tax-efficient withdrawal strategies can help minimize taxes owed when you start taking distributions.

7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Monitor the performance of your investments and your financial situation regularly. Rebalance your portfolio as needed.

Overall, it's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that aligns with your individual financial goals and circumstances.
