The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k) if you qualify for tax-deductible contributions.  
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, this could be a better option.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay taxes on any dividends, interest, or capital gains in the year they are realized. 

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before focusing too heavily on long-term investments.

5. **Long-Term Growth vs. Short-Term Needs**: Identify what portion of your funds you want to grow for long-term retirement and what portion you may need for short-term goals.

6. **Rebalance Your Portfolio**: Regularly review and adjust your investments across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions up to employer match. If you can contribute more without maxing out your limit, consider putting more here due to tax advantages.
- **IRA/Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if youâ€™re in a lower tax bracket now compared to what you expect in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for funds that you might need in the short-term or mid-term, or to hold investments that benefit from favorable tax treatment, such as qualified dividends.

Ultimately, it's important to assess your personal financial situation and possibly consult with a financial advisor to create a customized strategy.
