Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors such as your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of the match before putting money into other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high-income year, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions (the limit for 2023 is $22,500, or $30,000 if youâ€™re 50 or older). Contributions are pre-tax and reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) (if possible), consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA (with a contribution limit of $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After contributing to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This can be a good place for investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or long-term hold stocks, since qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Your marginal tax rate can influence your decisions. Sometimes it may be beneficial to contribute to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

5. **Adjust for Investment Goals and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts. Maintain a diversified portfolio.

6. **Review Regularly**: Financial situations and goals can change, so it's wise to review your investment allocations periodically and adjust as needed.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure or have a complex financial situation, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific needs.

Remember, the best distribution strategy for you will depend on your individual circumstances.
