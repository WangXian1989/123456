When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several strategies you can consider to maximize your investment growth while minimizing tax implications. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if financially feasible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute to an IRA to benefit from tax deductions (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth). Consider your current tax bracket when deciding which IRA to prioritize.

2. **Invest Based on Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts while reserving less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) for taxable accounts. This can help reduce your taxable income.
   - Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies in your taxable accounts to offset capital gains by selling underperforming assets.

3. **Diversify Across Accounts**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio within each account type to manage risk effectively. Ensure that the overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals, regardless of account type.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you're years away from retirement, consider holding riskier investments that could yield higher growth in tax-advantaged accounts. As you near retirement, start shifting towards more conservative investments.

5. **Annual Review**:
   - Periodically review your contributions and asset allocation to ensure they align with your financial goals, particularly when there are changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

By distributing your money wisely across these accounts, you can leverage the benefits of each while optimizing for tax efficiency and growth potential.
