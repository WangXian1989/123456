The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax bracket, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), depending on the plan. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, prioritize traditional contributions for immediate tax relief.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), an IRA can be either traditional or Roth. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA and expect your tax rate to increase in the future, prioritize Roth contributions for tax-free growth.

3. **Debt Consideration**: If you have high-interest debt (like credit card debt), focus on paying that down first before contributing heavily to retirement accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider taxable accounts for additional investment opportunities. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals but may have tax implications on capital gains.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place (typically 3-6 months' worth of expenses) before heavily investing in these accounts.

6. **Investment Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, diversify your investments across asset classes to manage risk effectively.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Reassess your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation and goals. They can provide personalized insights based on your overall financial picture.
