Thank you for your question! It's great that you're thinking about how to effectively allocate your money among different types of accounts. The best way to distribute your money can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, your tax situation, your age, and your risk tolerance. Here are a few guidelines that might help you:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a matching contribution, it's generally a good idea to contribute enough to get the full match as this is essentially free money. After that, consider how much you can contribute based on your overall financial plan.

2. **IRA Accounts**: Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions up front, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it could be beneficial to contribute there, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement. If you’re looking for tax deductions now, prioritize your traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: In addition to your retirement accounts, having investments in taxable accounts can provide flexibility. They allow you to access your money without penalties and can be used for short-term goals or emergencies. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments in these accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within these accounts, consider your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Younger investors often have a higher risk tolerance, while those nearing retirement might focus on preserving capital.

5. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

6. **Review Regularly**: It’s crucial to review your portfolio and investment strategy regularly to ensure it aligns with your changing financial goals and market conditions.
