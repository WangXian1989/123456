(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, it's usually advisable to contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money. 

2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to your IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax advantages. You can choose between traditional and Roth IRAs based on your current tax rates and future projections.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investing once you have maximized tax-advantaged accounts. Investments in these accounts can be more flexible but may incur capital gains taxes.

Balancing your contributions among these accounts can optimize your long-term savings and investment growth. Always consult with a financial adviser to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
