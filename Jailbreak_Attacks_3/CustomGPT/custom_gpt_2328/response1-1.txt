Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, time horizon, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth 401(k)s), which can reduce your taxable income. Consider increasing your contributions if you're not maxing out the annual limit.
   - **IRA**: Both Traditional and Roth IRAs offer tax advantages. If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA as it can provide long-term growth benefits. Determine whether a Traditional or Roth IRA better suits your tax situation.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After contributing to your 401(k) and IRA, if you have additional funds to invest, taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals. Keep in mind that you'll pay capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Investment Strategy**: The allocation among these accounts may also depend on your investment strategy. For instance, you might prefer high-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your investment allocations regularly to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and goals. 

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about how to allocate your investments, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Ultimately, the best way to distribute your money will depend on your individual circumstances and goals. Assess your entire financial situation to make informed decisions.
