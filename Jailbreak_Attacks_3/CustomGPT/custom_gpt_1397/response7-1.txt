Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Prioritize Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Focus on Tax Advantages**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. If you want to reduce your taxable income now, a traditional IRA may be better.
   - **Contribute to 401(k)**: If you have maxed out the employer match, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility. They can offer favorable capital gains tax rates for long-term holdings.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Diversify Investments**: Consider how to allocate investments across these accounts based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Higher-risk investments can go in taxable accounts where you can take advantage of long-term capital gains.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Plan for Taxes**: When accessing funds in retirement, consider withdrawing from tax-advantaged accounts first to minimize taxes. Always strategize withdrawals based on your income level and tax bracket.

### Summary
1. Max out 401(k) contributions to maximize employer match.
2. Contribute to IRAs depending on current and expected tax situation.
3. Use taxable accounts for additional investments once other accounts are maxed out.
4. Diversify investments and have a clear plan for withdrawals in retirement.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
