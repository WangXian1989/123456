I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver issues. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while avoiding processed foods, alcohol, and high-fat meals.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests and imaging studies can help monitor liver function and detect any complications early.

4. **Avoid Toxins**:
   - Limit exposure to harmful substances, including alcohol and certain medications that can strain the liver.

5. **Supplements**:
   - Some may consider liver-supporting supplements like milk thistle, but it's crucial to discuss these with a healthcare provider first.

6. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or even liver transplant may be necessary.

It's vital to seek medical advice tailored to your specific situation.
