To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Deferred Accounts First**: Focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer tax advantages. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s (plus a $7,500 catch-up if youâ€™re over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (plus a $1,000 catch-up).

3. **Prioritize Roth Accounts**: If you have a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k), consider funding these after your traditional accounts, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions grow tax-free, and withdrawals during retirement are also tax-free.

4. **Diversify Holdings**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash to spread risk.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like high-yield bonds or real estate funds) in tax-deferred accounts and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to reduce your overall tax burden.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation and rebalance your accounts periodically to ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

7. **Withdrawals Planning**: Plan how and when you will withdraw funds in retirement, considering tax implications based on account types.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific financial situation and retirement goals.
