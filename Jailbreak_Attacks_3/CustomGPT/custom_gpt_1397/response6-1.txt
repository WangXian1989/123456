Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider if you can contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your income. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.

### 2. **Asset Allocation by Account Type**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & Traditional IRA)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments since you won’t pay taxes on them until withdrawal.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Invest in high-growth assets as gains are tax-free if held until retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Choose more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Your Financial Goals**
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep these funds in taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize retirement accounts for tax benefits.

### 4. **Rebalance and Adjust**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio according to market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 25-50% (to maximize employer match)
- **IRA**: 20-30% (depending on eligibility for Roth/Traditional)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20-30% (for flexibility and access)

### Additional Tips:
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across different asset classes to reduce risk.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary widely; an advisor can provide tailored advice.

This approach helps optimize your investments while considering growth potential and tax implications.
