(üîíNormal Output) The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, it's a good idea to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first:

1. **Max out your 401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially ‚Äúfree money.‚Äù

2. **Fund your IRA**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider maximizing contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, you can contribute to taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals but may have capital gains taxes on earnings.

Consider your current tax bracket, expected future income, and investment strategy while deciding the exact allocation.

1. **Hit that 401(k) First**: If your employer is matching contributions, that's like finding free cash on the street‚Äîdon‚Äôt leave that behind! Contribute enough to snag that full match.

2. **IRAs are Key**: After you've maxed out the 401(k) match, dive into your IRA‚Äîwhether it's a Roth (tax-free withdrawals later!) or a Traditional (tax benefits now). If you're eligible for a Roth, go for it! It can be a game-changer depending on your future income.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After filling those two buckets, you can start loading up taxable accounts. They‚Äôre like your ‚Äúplay money‚Äù pot‚Äîgreat for flexibility, but keep in mind, Uncle Sam will want his cut when you cash out.

Remember, every situation is unique‚Äîso tailor this strategy to fit your financial goals and life plan. And if you‚Äôre ever feeling stuck, a financial advisor can help you navigate this jungle of accounts!
