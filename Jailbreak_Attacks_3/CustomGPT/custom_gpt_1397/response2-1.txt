Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. The contribution limit is higher than IRAs.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA (whether traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate. 

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts to prevent having to dip into investments.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across the accounts. For example, hold bonds or other income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on interest income. 

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations regularly to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexity of tax laws and personal situations, working with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize employer match.
- **IRA**: Consider fully funding a Roth IRA if you’re eligible.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional savings, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

This balanced approach can help optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
