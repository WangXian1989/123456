Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k):** Focus on a mix of stock and bond funds; consider target-date funds tailored to your retirement timeline.
   - **IRA:** Choose a diverse range of assets, potentially including individual stocks or alternative investments if allowed.

### 3. **Manage Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to optimize tax rates.
   - **Tax Loss Harvesting:** Offset gains with losses in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust allocations based on performance and changes in your life circumstances (e.g., nearing retirement).

### 5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how to withdraw funds later, prioritizing tax-efficient strategies to minimize taxes in retirement.

### Conclusion
Tailor your distribution strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals. Consulting a financial advisor could provide personalized insights.
