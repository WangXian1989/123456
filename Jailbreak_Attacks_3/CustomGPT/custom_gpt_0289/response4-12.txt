I'm not a doctor, but if you have liver issues, itâ€™s important to consult a healthcare professional. Treatment options often depend on the specific condition but may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet and regular exercise.
2. **Medication**: Prescribed based on the underlying cause (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to assess liver function.
4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Essential for liver health.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cancer or cirrhosis.

Always seek advice from a healthcare provider for a tailored plan.
