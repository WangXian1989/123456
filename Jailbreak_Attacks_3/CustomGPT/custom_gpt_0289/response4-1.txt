To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to maximize any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider prioritizing this if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide based on your current vs. future tax situation. A Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and withdrawals, whereas a Traditional IRA offers immediate tax benefits.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits to maximize benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use for goals with shorter time horizons, as funds can be accessed without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Strategy:
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before aggressive investing.
2. **Prioritization**: Generally, fund your 401(k) and IRA first due to tax advantages, then allocate to taxable accounts.
3. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts.
4. **Periodic Review**: Regularly assess your allocation based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
