To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer matches. Contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth. Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - Consider a Traditional IRA if you prefer immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Utilize taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you need flexibility. They are beneficial for investing in assets that may generate capital gains or dividends, which can be taxed at a lower rate.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize taxable distributions.

### General Guidelines:
- **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset types across all accounts.
- **Asset Location**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts and income-generating assets in taxable accounts.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and market changes. 

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your goals and tax situation.
