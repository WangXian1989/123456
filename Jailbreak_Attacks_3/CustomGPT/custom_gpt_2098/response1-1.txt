Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA (traditional or Roth), as they offer tax benefits that can maximize your long-term growth.

3. **Consider Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA might be beneficial since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, traditional accounts (like a 401(k) and traditional IRA) could be more beneficial as you defer taxes.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for investments. This allows for more flexibility with withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Emergency Fund and Debt**: Ensure you have an emergency fund and address any high-interest debt before heavily investing in these accounts.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your individual circumstances.
