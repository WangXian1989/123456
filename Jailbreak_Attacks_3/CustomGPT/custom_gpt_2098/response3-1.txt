Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Taxable accounts can be useful for shorter-term goals since they allow more flexibility. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Across all accounts, ensure a diversified portfolio considering your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and market conditions.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired level of risk.

### 6. **Consider Withdrawals**
   - Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement; often, it makes sense to draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (401(k), IRA), and finally, tax-free accounts (Roth IRA) last.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Adviser**
   - Getting personalized advice can help you tailor your strategy to your unique circumstances.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy tailored to your long-term financial goals.
