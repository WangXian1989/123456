1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and imaging tests can help track liver function and the progression of the disease.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options like liver transplant may be necessary.

Always follow your doctor's recommendations and attend all follow-up appointments for the best outcomes.
