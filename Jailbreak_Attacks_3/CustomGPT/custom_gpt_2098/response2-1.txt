Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and the investment options available. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your contributions to reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA, in particular, grows tax-free, which can be beneficial for long-term growth.

3. **Assess Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now but expect to be lower in retirement, a traditional IRA or 401(k) may be more beneficial. Conversely, if you expect to be in a similar or higher tax bracket, a Roth IRA might be advantageous.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After contributing to your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and have no contribution limits.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure you diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and help optimize your portfolio.

Balancing contributions across these accounts can optimize your financial growth while managing taxes effectively.
