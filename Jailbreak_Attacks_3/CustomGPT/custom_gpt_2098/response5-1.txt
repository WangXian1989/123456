Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some key strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to either a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions and tax-deferred growth) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Choose based on your current tax rate versus expected tax rate in retirement.

### 2. **Investment Allocation:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth investments, as these accounts allow for tax-deferred or tax-free growth. Stocks, mutual funds, or ETFs can be suitable choices.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains or interest that may be taxed. Consider holding tax-efficient index funds or ETFs to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Consider your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Plan to withdraw from taxable accounts first (to keep tax-advantaged accounts growing), followed by traditional IRAs and 401(k)s last to minimize tax implications.

### 4. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can help tailor your investment strategy based on your individual circumstances and objectives.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach with a focus on maximizing tax advantages can lead to better long-term growth. Regularly reviewing your financial situation will help you make informed adjustments to your strategy.
