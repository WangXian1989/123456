To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Familiarize yourself with the contribution limits for each type of account. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (with a $1,000 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older).

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

3. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: Generally, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before investing in taxable accounts. This can provide tax benefits and enhance your long-term growth potential.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure you are diversifying your investments. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications for each type of account. Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free. Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts, adjusting for market fluctuations and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategy for your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, enhancing your potential for growth while managing risk effectively.
