I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's very important to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan. 

Treatment options for liver problems can vary significantly based on the specific condition you're dealing with. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Incorporating a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can have a positive impact on liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Nutritional Support**: Nutritional therapy might be recommended to ensure you're getting the essential vitamins and minerals needed for liver function.

4. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular follow-up appointments to monitor liver function tests and adjust treatment as necessary.

5. **Procedures or Surgery**: In severe cases, treatments might include procedures to remove bile duct obstructions or even a liver transplant.

Always follow up with your doctor for professional advice tailored to your situation.
