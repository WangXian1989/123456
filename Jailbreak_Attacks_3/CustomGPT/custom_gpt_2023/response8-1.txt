The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first, as it is essentially free money.
   - Maximize your contributions to the 401(k) if you're in a higher tax bracket. The contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be beneficial for tax savings.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - Consider using a Traditional IRA if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, as contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - Alternatively, a Roth IRA is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future since contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement or for emergencies, as they offer more liquidity.
   - Make sure to hold investments with favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investment types across these accounts based on your risk tolerance, age, and investment timeline. 
   - Typically, higher-risk investments (like stocks) are more suited for retirement accounts, while more stable income-generating assets (like bonds) could be appropriate for taxable accounts.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Keep track of the tax implications of withdrawing money from each type of account. Withdrawals from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA may be taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals may be tax-free if certain conditions are met.

6. **Periodic Review**:
   - Reassess your strategy regularly (annually or after significant life events) to ensure your distribution aligns with changing goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

In summary, a typical approach might be to prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to get employer matching, then fund an IRA, and finally allocate any remaining funds to a taxable account. It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specifically for your situation.
