Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. The tax advantages of these accounts are significant, particularly if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Continue to Fund 401(k)**: After maximizing the IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k), especially if you have a high income or your employer offers a good selection of investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can look into taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility and liquidity, which can be beneficial if you plan to access the funds before retirement. Invest in tax-efficient funds or assets to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Consider Tax Situations**: Keep in mind that distributions from traditional 401(k) and IRA accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth accounts are tax-free in retirement. Balancing withdrawals from these accounts can help manage taxes in retirement.

6. **Diversification and Rebalancing**: Diversify your investments across all accounts and periodically rebalance to maintain your target asset allocation.

It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your individual circumstances.
