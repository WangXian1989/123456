To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options:

### 1. **Assess Contribution Limits and Benefits**
   - **401(k):** Take advantage of employer matching contributions, if available. This is essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Ensure you understand the contribution limits and tax implications. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions on contributions.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & Traditional IRA):**
     - You won’t pay taxes until you withdraw funds, usually in retirement when your income may be lower.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments at a profit. 

### 3. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**
   - **Higher Growth Investments:** Consider holding these in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax-free or deferred growth.
   - **Income-Producing Investments:** Place these in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Implement a Strategy Based on Financial Goals**
   - If your goal is long-term growth, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA until you reach the maximum limits, then allocate any excess funds to your taxable accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals, keep funds in taxable accounts for easier access.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustments**
   - Periodically assess your portfolio and reallocate as needed based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation or goals.

By employing these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Regularly reviewing your allocations will help ensure you’re on track to meet your financial objectives.
