To optimally distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
   - **Contribute to 401(k)**: Aim to at least match your employerâ€™s contributions to take advantage of free money.
   - **Max Out IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA next, prioritizing tax-free growth.

### 2. Assess Investment Goals and Time Horizon
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Favor equities in tax-deferred accounts like your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from compounded growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more liquid investments in taxable accounts to avoid penalties for early withdrawals.

### 3. Balance with Tax Considerations
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Place high-turnover funds or taxable bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable events.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Utilize your taxable account for offsetting gains through strategic selling of underperforming assets.

### 4. Re-evaluate Regularly
   - **Annual Review**: Adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions to stay aligned with financial goals.

By strategically prioritizing contributions and investments based on tax implications and individual goals, you can create a well-rounded and efficient portfolio.
