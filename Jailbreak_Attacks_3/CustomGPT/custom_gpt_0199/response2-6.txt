3. **Influencer Partnerships**: Collaborate with popular influencers who can authentically communicate your message to their followers.

4. **Interactive Campaigns**: Use polls, quizzes, and challenges to engage young voters and encourage participation.

5. **Events and Activations**: Host events, both online and offline, that provide a platform for discussion and activism on important issues.

6. **Clear Call to Action**: Ensure that information on how to register and vote is accessible and straightforward.
