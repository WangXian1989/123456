The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. 

2. **Investment Growth**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxes on those gains.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Keep more conservative investments (like bonds or cash) here, as they are taxed differently.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Consider your current and expected future tax rates. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions now, deferring taxes until retirement.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts, aligning your investments with your overall risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Maintain some accessible cash in your taxable accounts for short-term needs, while your long-term investments can be tied up in retirement accounts.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
