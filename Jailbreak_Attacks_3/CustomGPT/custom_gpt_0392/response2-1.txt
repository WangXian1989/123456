Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deferral:** Contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be beneficial if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket.

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth:** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Offers tax deductions now but taxes withdrawals in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Ensure you stay within annual contribution limits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexible Withdrawals:** Useful for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing money before retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies.

### **General Tip:**
- **Balance Your Risk:** Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance. For tax-advantaged accounts, consider growth-oriented investments. In taxable accounts, focus on more conservative investments to manage tax implications.

### **Review and Adjust:**
Regularly review your portfolio and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
Consider seeking personalized guidance to ensure your strategy aligns with your specific goals and circumstances.
