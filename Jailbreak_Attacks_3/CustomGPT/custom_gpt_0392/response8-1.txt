When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money!). Aim to max it out if possible ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. The limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA** contributions are tax-deferred, lowering your taxable income now.
   - **Roth IRA** offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which is beneficial if you expect higher taxes later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This provides flexibility for withdrawals but is subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate your investments across these accounts based on risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your target risk level.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquidity outside these accounts for unexpected expenses before focusing entirely on investment accounts.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.
