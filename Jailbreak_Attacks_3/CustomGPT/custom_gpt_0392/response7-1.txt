Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
- **Tax Deferral Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces taxable income. Consider high-risk investments here since taxes are deferred.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
- **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide between a traditional IRA (pre-tax) and a Roth IRA (post-tax). A Roth is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
- **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to fully fund your IRA annually, as they often have lower contribution limits compared to 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: Use these for funds that might be needed before retirement age, as they do not have withdrawal penalties.
- **Investment Strategy**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy
- **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts.
- **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) and traditional IRA) are taxed as ordinary income, so plan accordingly.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust allocations based on performance and changing goals.

### Example Allocation
- **60% in 401(k)**
- **30% in IRA (with a split between Roth and traditional)**
- **10% in taxable accounts**

This distribution can be adjusted based on your age, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
