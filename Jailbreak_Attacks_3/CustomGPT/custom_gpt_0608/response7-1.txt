Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—that’s essentially free money. Aim to contribute the annual limit if you can.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may provide a tax deduction, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Once you have maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices but will be subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider a Balanced Portfolio**:
   - Diversification across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) is important in all types of accounts. Generally, higher-risk investments like stocks may be better suited for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while you might hold more stable investments in taxable accounts for liquidity.

4. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing from accounts in retirement. 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax on profits.

5. **Adjust Based on Life Events**:
   - Your distribution strategy may change based on major life events (e.g., marriage, children, job changes). Regularly review and adjust your allocations accordingly.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.

By strategically allocating funds across these accounts, you can optimize tax efficiency and prepare for a comfortable retirement.
