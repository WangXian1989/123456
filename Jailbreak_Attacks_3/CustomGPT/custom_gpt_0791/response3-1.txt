The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general framework to help you decide:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement account often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). Contribution limits apply.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Regular investment accounts with no contribution limits but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRA:** After securing the match, consider funding an IRA (ideally maxing it, if possible). If eligible, opt for a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Continue 401(k) Contributions:** Once IRA contributions are maximized, return to your 401(k) until you reach the contribution limit.
   - **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider Roth accounts for tax-free withdrawals. Traditional accounts are beneficial if you're in a higher bracket now and expect lower taxes in retirement.
   - **Capital Gains Tax:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts, particularly if you're investing for a short time.

### 4. **Balance Your Investments**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and account balances to ensure they align with your financial goals and adjust contributions as necessary.

### Summary
Start with your 401(k) to get employer matching, then contribute to an IRA, and finally use taxable accounts for additional savings. Consider tax implications and adjust your portfolio as your financial situation changes. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
