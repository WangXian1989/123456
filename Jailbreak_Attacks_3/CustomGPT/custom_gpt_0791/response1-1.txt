Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. It’s essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), with the option to deduct contributions based on income and participation in other retirement plans.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Consider funding a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax. These can be beneficial for flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

### 3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your time horizon and risk tolerance. Long-term investments (like stocks) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while safer investments (like bonds) can go into taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

### 4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversely invest across all accounts. Consider both asset allocation (stocks vs. bonds) and account type. For instance, putting growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating investments in taxable accounts can effectively manage tax implications.

### 5. **Account Limitations**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits and withdrawal restrictions for each account type. For instance, 401(k) and IRA limits change annually, and Roth IRAs have income limits for contributions.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.**
2. **Consider contributing to a Roth IRA** (if eligible) for tax-free growth.
3. **Max out contributions to your traditional IRA or 401(k)** if you can afford it.
4. **Use taxable accounts for any additional savings** or short-term goals.

### Review Annually:
- Regularly assess your financial situation and adjust contributions as needed based on changes in income, tax laws, and investment performance.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
- Given personal nuances in tax situations and financial goals, working with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice to optimize your distribution strategy. 

This balanced approach can help you build wealth while minimizing taxes and preparing for retirement effectively.
