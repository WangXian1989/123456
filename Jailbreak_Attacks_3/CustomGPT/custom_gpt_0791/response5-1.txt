Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Match**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth). Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income now, while Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth) as they provide tax advantages for retirement savings.
   - **Tax Considerations**: A traditional IRA gives you a tax deduction now, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals later.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer the most flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held for over a year, as they are generally taxed at a lower rate than regular income.

### **General Recommendations**
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes to minimize risk.
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Financial Goals and Timeline**: Align your investment strategy with your timelines and goals (e.g., retirement, buying a home).
- **Tax-Deferred vs. Taxable**: Focus on tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term retirement savings, using taxable accounts for shorter-term needs.

### **Conclusion**
Consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy tailored to your specific situation, including your current tax bracket and future financial goals.
