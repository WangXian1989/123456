Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. A Traditional IRA provides tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Contributions to 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal. Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals but require after-tax contributions.
   - Taxable accounts subject you to capital gains taxes when investments are sold. It's often beneficial to hold investments in these accounts with lower turnover to minimize tax liability.

3. **Investment Type and Time Horizon**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes. Conversely, consider placing bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts for favorable tax treatment.
   - If you're closer to retirement, consider a more conservative balance across these accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. For example, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically assess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Rebalance as needed.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your circumstances, helping you optimize your investment distribution.

In summary, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider the tax implications of each account, and align your investment choices with your retirement timeline.
