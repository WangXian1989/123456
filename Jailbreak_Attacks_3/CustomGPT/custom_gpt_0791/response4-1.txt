Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA:**
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (if feasible), consider investing in taxable accounts for more flexibility. Investments in these accounts can be accessed without the penalties that apply to retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Tailor your asset allocation based on the time horizon for your goals and risk tolerance. Typically, more aggressive investments may be held in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes, while more stable investments can be held in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it may make sense to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Think about the tax implications of investments within each account. For example, tax-efficient investments (like index funds) may be better suited for taxable accounts, while higher-growth investments can be advantageous in tax-deferred accounts.

7. **Regular Reassessment:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.
