Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Maximize contributions to these accounts first, as they offer tax-deferred growth. If your employer matches contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Roth IRA** (if eligible): Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Keep investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - If youâ€™re far from retirement, you might prioritize growth-focused investments in these accounts to capitalize on compounding.
   - As you approach retirement, consider shifting some assets to less volatile investments.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergency funds since they offer easier access without penalties.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Ensure your overall investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals, regardless of account type.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment mix.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
