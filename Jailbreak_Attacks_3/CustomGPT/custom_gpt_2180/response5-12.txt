I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about potential treatment options for liver problems, which could include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This often involves dietary modifications, such as reducing alcohol intake, avoiding fatty foods, and eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe antiviral medications, steroids, or other treatments to manage symptoms and reduce inflammation.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-Ups**: Keeping regular appointments with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and adjust treatment as needed.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cancer or cirrhosis leading to liver failure, surgical options like a liver transplant may be considered.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized assessment and treatment plan based on your specific situation.
