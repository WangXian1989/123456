Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money. Aim for the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider making contributions to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for any additional savings once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of stocks and bonds, considering your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Similar approach but can include more diversified assets like ETFs or individual stocks.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize tax liabilities on gains.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Always maintain an emergency fund, ideally three to six months’ worth of expenses, outside these accounts.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your long-term goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
