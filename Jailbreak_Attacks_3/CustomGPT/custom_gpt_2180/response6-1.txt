To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if eligible, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - Use the 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth and tax deferral.
   - Keep more liquid, short-term investments in taxable accounts for flexibility and lower capital gains taxes if held long-term.

### 3. **Balance Risk and Growth:**
   - Allocate a higher percentage to growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments that you might need access to sooner.

### 4. **Consider Fees and Investment Options:**
   - Review your 401(k) for high fees or limited investment options and balance this with lower-cost IRAs or taxable accounts if necessary.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess Allocation:**
   - Annually review and adjust your contributions and asset allocation based on performance, risk tolerance, and financial goals.

### 6. **Leverage Tax Loss Harvesting:**
   - In taxable accounts, consider selling underperforming investments to offset gains, thus managing your tax liability effectively.

Following these strategies can help ensure a balanced and tax-efficient approach to your investment distribution.
