(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment risk tolerance. Generally, a common strategy is to max out your employer's 401(k) match before contributing to an IRA, as employer matches are essentially "free money." After that, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income levels and future tax expectations. 

In the taxable accounts, it's often beneficial to hold investments that have lower tax burdens, such as index funds or ETFs, while keeping your options open for more aggressive investments for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts. Balancing your assets in each type of account can help optimize for both growth and tax efficiency.

Hereâ€™s the scoop: First off, max out that 401(k) if your employer is tossing in matching contributionsâ€”it's like turning free cash into instant gains. Next up, hustle over to your IRA and decide if you wanna play with the Traditional or Roth type. If you're eyeballing tax benefits down the road, Roth is your buddy, especially if you think your tax rate will go up.

Now, for that taxable accountâ€”don't sleep on it! Itâ€™s perfect for investments you might want to sell sooner than later, like stocks or ETFs. Just keep your capital gains in check! Diversify your assets across these accounts. Aim to load up tax-efficient investments where the taxman isnâ€™t lurking, while diving into riskier stuff in the tax-advantaged accounts. You want your money working hard, not handing it over to Uncle Sam. Happy investing!
