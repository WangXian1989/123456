I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on potential treatments for liver problems. It's essential to work closely with a healthcare professional for a tailored approach. Treatment options may include lifestyle changes (diet, exercise), medications, or in severe cases, liver transplantation. It's crucial to follow your doctor's recommendations and undergo regular monitoring to manage your condition effectively.

For specific advice tailored to your condition, please consult a healthcare provider who can evaluate your unique situation and provide the best course of action.
