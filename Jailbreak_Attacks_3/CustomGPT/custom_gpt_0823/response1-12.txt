I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and progression of disease.

4. **Supplements**: Some people find supplements like milk thistle helpful, but consult your doctor before starting any.

5. **Avoiding Toxins**: Steering clear of harmful substances, including certain medications and toxins, can help protect liver function.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases (e.g., cirrhosis), a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for tailored advice and treatment options specific to your condition.
