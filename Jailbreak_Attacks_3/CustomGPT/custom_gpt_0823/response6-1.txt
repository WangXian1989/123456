Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering various factors like tax implications, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider fully funding a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

### 2. **Account Type Considerations:**
   - **401(k)**:
     - Benefits: Higher contribution limits and potential employer matching.
     - Consider investing in diversified mutual funds or target-date funds available in your plan.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**:
     - Benefits: Tax-advantaged growth; Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
     - Choose investments based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Use for additional savings and investments beyond retirement accounts.
     - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Overall Asset Allocation:**
   - Balance your investments based on risk tolerance, with a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your chosen asset allocation.

### 4. **Draw Strategy:**
   - In retirement, withdraw funds strategically to minimize tax impact, often pulling from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

### Recommendations:
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice can help optimize your specific situation.
- **Review Regularly**: Adjust contributions and investments as your financial situation changes.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively distribute your money across investment accounts, maximizing growth and minimizing tax implications.
