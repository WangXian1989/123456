When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA up to the maximum limits first. These accounts offer tax-deferred growth (401(k)) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Keep a portion of your investments in taxable accounts for liquidity and potential capital gains benefits.

### 2. **Diversification**
   - Allocate assets across various classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to reduce risk.
   - Maintain the same investment strategy regardless of the account type.

### 3. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - Check annual contribution limits for 401(k) ($22,500 for 2024) and IRAs ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50) to plan your contributions accordingly.

### 4. **Employer Match**
   - If your employer offers a match in the 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match; itâ€™s essentially free money.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for tax implications when you start withdrawing funds, especially from taxable accounts versus tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Retirement Goals and Timeline**
   - Assess your retirement age and goals to determine how aggressively to invest in each account.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and long-term goals.

By focusing on these areas, you can effectively distribute your money to optimize growth and tax efficiency for your retirement.
