Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Consider maximizing employer matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or Roth IRA (after-tax), the tax benefits vary. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages but gains are taxed at capital gains rates, which are generally lower than ordinary income tax rates.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term vs. long-term goals. For long-term retirement savings, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2024, the limits are $23,000 for 401(k)s (plus $7,500 catch-up if you're over 50) and $7,000 for IRAs (plus $1,000 catch-up).

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Money in taxable accounts is more accessible without penalties compared to retirement accounts. Keep some funds liquid for emergencies.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact, while holding tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Suggested Strategy:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match first.

2. **Fund Roth IRA (if eligible)**:
   - If you qualify based on income, consider putting money into a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

3. **Contribute to Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Keep your overall portfolio balanced according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help tailor strategies based on your specific situation.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment distribution for growth and tax efficiency.
