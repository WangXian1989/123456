Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, which is essentially free money. If you can, aim to contribute the maximum allowed ($22,500 for 2024, with an additional $7,500 catch-up if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The max contribution is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50+). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions. If you anticipate a lower tax rate, a Traditional IRA might be better.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within these accounts, diversify your investments to spread risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, aligning with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate a lot of taxable income (like bonds) or for funds you might need before retirement age. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling assets.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Emergencies**: 
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing, typically 3-6 months' worth of living expenses.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.
