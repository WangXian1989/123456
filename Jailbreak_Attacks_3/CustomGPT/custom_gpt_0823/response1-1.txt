Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - Focus on maxing out your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax considerations).
   - If you still have funds left, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates.
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - Ensure a good mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts. Avoid over-concentration in any one account type.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your allocations periodically and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk profile.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid withdrawals that could incur taxes or penalties.

### Conclusion
Consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal situation is also a good move. This ensures you're optimizing both your investment growth and tax efficiency.
