Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to get the full employer match if one is offered. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA:** Consider funding a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you're looking for immediate tax benefits, a traditional IRA might be better, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk, considering asset allocation suited to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, or personal financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full match.
- **IRA:** Max out your traditional or Roth IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional savings after maximizing the above.

### Conclusion
Tailor your approach based on your unique situation. Consulting a financial advisor can help you develop a personalized plan.
