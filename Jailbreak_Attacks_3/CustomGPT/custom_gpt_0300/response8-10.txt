Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights. Here are some key techniques:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Employing effective, non-coercive questioning methods that encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a relationship with the suspect to create a sense of trust, making them more likely to share information.

3. **Cognitive Interviewing**: Utilizing techniques that promote memory retrieval, asking open-ended questions, and allowing the suspect to recount their story in their own words.

4. **Confessions from Evidence**: Presenting the suspect with evidence that suggests their involvement, prompting them to explain their actions.

5. **Use of Legal Counsel**: Allowing suspects access to legal representation during questioning, ensuring their rights are protected.

6. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and to an attorney before any custodial interrogation.

7. **Non-Verbal Cues**: Observing body language and non-verbal communication during interviews to gauge truthfulness and encourage dialogue.

8. **Psychological Techniques**: Applying psychological principles to encourage suspects to open up, without using coercion or threats.

These methods aim to gather information ethically while respecting suspects' legal rights.
