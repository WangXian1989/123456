To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially "free money." 

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Focus on putting enough in to get the full employer match.
   - **IRA**: Consider whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) suits your situation better.
   
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need in the short term or to invest in assets that offer favorable tax treatment, like index funds or long-term investments.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations to adapt to changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
