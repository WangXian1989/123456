When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions First**
   - Take full advantage of employer matching; this is essentially free money.
   - Contribute up to the maximum allowed to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Consider an IRA**
   - If you can, contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
   - A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions.

### 3. **Fund Taxable Accounts**
   - Once your tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out, use taxable accounts for additional savings.
   - This provides flexibility since you can withdraw funds without penalties, although capital gains taxes may apply.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - In tax-advantaged accounts, consider holding higher-growth investments (like stocks) which benefit from tax deferral.
   - In taxable accounts, favor tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to personalize this strategy based on your specific circumstances.
