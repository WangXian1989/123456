To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first. This is free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **Pre-tax Contributions**: 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, focus on this account.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement, consider maxing out a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Balance Contributions**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (if eligible) or a traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.
   - If you have more to invest after maxing out the above, fit contributions into your taxable account for flexibility.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across all accounts, considering risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your allocations periodically to align with your financial goals.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Keep tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (IRA/401(k)) and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
