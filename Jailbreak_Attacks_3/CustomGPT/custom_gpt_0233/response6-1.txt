To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, and then max out your IRA (Roth or traditional based on your tax situation).
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may be more tax-efficient or have short-term goals.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on growth-oriented investments in retirement accounts where they can compound tax-free.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate funds in taxable accounts for more liquid or accessible investments, balancing risk and return.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account to manage risk effectively.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset mix.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Plan for Retirement Withdrawals**: Consider your withdrawal strategy in retirement; tax-advantaged accounts may be tapped first to allow taxable accounts to grow longer.

Implementing these strategies can enhance your overall return while managing risk and tax implications effectively. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
