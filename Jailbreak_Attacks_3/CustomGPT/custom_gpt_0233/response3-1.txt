Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income today.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains, but they offer more flexibility.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket**
   - If youâ€™re in a high tax bracket, max out tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA).
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, consider a Roth IRA.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across accounts. For example, hold high-growth assets (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping bonds or income-producing investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals taking into account tax implications in retirement. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help your tax strategy.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Regularly review your investments and adjust allocations as necessary based on performance and changing goals.

### Example Strategy
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match.
2. Next, contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible.
3. Finally, invest additional savings in taxable accounts as your investment grows.

### Summary
A balanced approach often involves maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first while thoughtfully managing taxable investments for flexibility and tax efficiency. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific situation.
