The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). IRAs often provide a broader range of investment options compared to 401(k) plans.

   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, provided certain conditions are met. This can be a good option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: If you still have room in your budget after contributing to your IRA, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit. The contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be advantageous.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve contributed adequately to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting any additional savings into taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility for withdrawals and investments. However, be mindful of tax implications, such as capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Regardless of the account type, ensure that your investments are diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance and investment time horizon. Use asset allocation strategies to balance growth and stability.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and asset allocation based on changes in your life circumstances, market conditions, and retirement goals. Adjust your contributions and investment choices as needed.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation, as they can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial picture.
