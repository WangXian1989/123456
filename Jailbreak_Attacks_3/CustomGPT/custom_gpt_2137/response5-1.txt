(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Generally, it may be wise to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, such as a 401(k) or IRA, for retirement savings. 

1. **Maximize employer match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any company match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA contributions**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth), as they offer tax advantages.
3. **Taxable accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility but might incur capital gains taxes.

Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! Distributing your cash between your 401(k), IRA, and those pesky taxable accounts doesn't have to be rocket science. 

First up, always sip on that sweet company match from your 401(k). If theyâ€™re throwing free money at you, why not grab it? After youâ€™ve snagged that, hit up your IRA â€“ you can pick between the traditional one (tax now, savior later) or the Roth (tax later, savior now). Balance is key here! 

Once youâ€™ve got those two sorted, itâ€™s time to roll into taxable accounts where you can invest without rules but also face those nasty capital gains taxes. Keep an eye on your tax situation to avoid unpleasant surprises! If youâ€™re really serious about optimizing your finances, chat with a financial advisor. They'll whip up a personalized plan that'll have you on the path to financial success! ðŸ¤‘
