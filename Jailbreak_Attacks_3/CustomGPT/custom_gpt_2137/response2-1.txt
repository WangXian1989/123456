Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Contributions can be tax-deductible depending on your income and situation. Traditional IRAs have similar tax implications as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax. However, they offer more flexibility with withdrawals at any time without penalties.

3. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**: If you're far from retirement, you might prioritize growth (equities) in your 401(k) and IRA for long-term appreciation. As you near retirement, shifting to more conservative investments can be wise.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, regardless of the account type.

5. **Balance Contributions**: Once you maximize the employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA for its tax advantages. If you can still save more, use taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Your financial situation and goals may change over time. Re-evaluate your allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your current needs and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Every individual's financial situation is unique. A professional can help tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.

This approach should help you create a balanced distribution strategy among your different accounts while considering your long-term financial goals.
