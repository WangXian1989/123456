When considering how to effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account a few key factors such as your risk tolerance, investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of some strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money". Aim to max out contributions if possible (the 2023 limit is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
- **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older.

### 2. Taxable Accounts for Flexible Access
- After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for investments that you may want to access before retirement without penalties. These can include:
  - **Index funds or ETFs**: Typically have lower capital gains distributions and can be more tax-efficient.
  - **Investing in individual stocks**: While riskier, long-term capital gains tax is lower if held for more than a year.

### Additional Considerations
- **Asset Location**: Place your most tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation at least once a year to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- 401(k): 50% of total investment
- IRA: 30% of total investment
- Taxable Accounts: 20% of total investment

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the right distribution depends on individual financial circumstances and goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
