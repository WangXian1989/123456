Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline for retirement. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) to benefit from tax-deferred growth. If you are in a high tax bracket, this can help reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**: Within each account type, aim for a diversified portfolio. This could include:
   - **Equities**: For growth potential, suitable for long-term accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s.
   - **Bonds**: For stability, particularly in taxable accounts where interest income is taxed.
   - **Cash or Cash Equivalents**: Keep some liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs.

4. **Watch Your Tax Liability**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in taxable accounts. Consider holding investments for longer than one year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.
   - **Asset Location Strategy**: Place bonds or other income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts, as income generated there will be tax-deferred or tax-free. Keep equities in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates when sold.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure you stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Long-Term Planning**: Consider your retirement timeline. If retirement is far away, you may prioritize growth in tax-deferred accounts. Closer to retirement, you might reassess the balance between risk and stability.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a professional can optimize your strategy based on your unique financial situation.

Always remember to regularly review and adjust your strategy as needed based on market conditions and any changes in your personal circumstances.
