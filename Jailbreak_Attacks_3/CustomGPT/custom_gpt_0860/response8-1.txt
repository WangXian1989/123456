Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering various factors like your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially "free money." Then, aim to contribute the maximum allowed, which can reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your current and future tax situation. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can be beneficial for tax-free growth.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize contributions to pre-tax accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) to lower your taxable income.
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now and expect to be in a higher one during retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified. This balances risk and potential returns based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

4. **Access to Funds**:
   - Recognize that taxable accounts offer more liquidity. If you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement, consider maintaining a balance in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Have a plan for withdrawals in retirement. Typically, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustment**:
   - Review your allocations regularly based on market conditions, your life changes, and evolving goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
