Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: In 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). Prioritize this if you’re below these limits.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial. A Roth IRA can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement or for short-term goals. They offer more flexibility but may incur taxes on capital gains.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications.

### General Distribution Strategy:

1. **First Focus on the 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
2. **Maximize IRA Contributions**: After the employer match, consider maxing out an IRA.
3. **Contribute to Taxable Accounts**: Use leftover funds for a taxable account, especially for short- to medium-term goals.

### Rebalance Regularly:
- Reassess your allocations periodically based on changes in goals, market performance, and personal circumstances.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
- Because individual situations can vary greatly, working with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs and goals. 

This approach ensures you're maximizing growth potential while mitigating tax impacts over time.
