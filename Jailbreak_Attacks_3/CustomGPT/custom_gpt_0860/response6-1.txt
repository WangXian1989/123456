Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

2. **Consider Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus more on tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments with potential tax-free growth (like a Roth IRA).
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need in the near term, keeping investments relatively more liquid.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Investing in tax-efficient funds can help minimize tax impacts.
   - **Account Growth**: Keep higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on the income they generate.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts to spread risk and optimize growth.

5. **Periodic Review**:
   - Regularly review your portfolio and adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

This approach can help you leverage the tax benefits of each account type while optimizing your overall investment strategy.
