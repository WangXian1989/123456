Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute up to the maximum allowable limit.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA. Choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible now but taxed on withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free).

3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For example, in 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if aged 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if 50 and older).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, consider investing in a taxable account for additional flexibility. This is helpful for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement age.

5. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. For growth, you may prefer stocks in tax-advantaged accounts and consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Annual Review**: Regularly review and adjust your strategy based on changes in your financial situation, investment performance, and tax laws.

Before making any decisions, it might be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
