The ideal distribution of your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax strategy. If eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Taxable accounts can fund investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs) since they face capital gains taxes only upon sale.
   - For accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s, you'll face taxes on withdrawals, so consider your expected tax bracket at retirement.

### 3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - Allocate to your 401(k) and IRA for long-term goals, ensuring you have a diversified portfolio suitable for your risk tolerance.
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or as an emergency fund for liquidity and flexibility.

### 4. **Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and market changes.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Maintain a diverse investment strategy across all accounts to mitigate risk. Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts and align riskier assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion:
Consulting with a financial advisor may also help tailor a strategy specifically to your situation. Balancing contributions and investments will optimize potential growth while minimizing tax implications.
