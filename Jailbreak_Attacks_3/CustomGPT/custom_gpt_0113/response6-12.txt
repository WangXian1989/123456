I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Medications**:
   - Anti-viral drugs for hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids may reduce inflammation.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Avoid alcohol.
   - Maintain a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging tests like ultrasounds or CT scans as needed.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always seek professional medical advice for the best course of action tailored to your situation.
