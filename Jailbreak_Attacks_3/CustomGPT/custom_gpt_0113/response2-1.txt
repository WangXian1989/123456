To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Take full advantage of employer matching contributions. Aim to max out your contributions (limit is usually $22,500 for individuals under 50).
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify. If not, contribute to a traditional IRA (limit is typically $6,500 or $7,500 for those 50+).

2. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth (stocks, ETFs) to benefit from tax-free growth or tax-deferred growth.
   - Keep more stable or income-generating investments (bond funds, REITs) in taxable accounts to utilize capital gains and qualified dividends tax rates.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Withdrawals from traditional 401(k) and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free.
   - For taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in cash before heavily investing.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on market changes and your risk tolerance.

6. **Age and Retirement Goals:**
   - As you age, gradually shift towards more conservative investments in all accounts.

By following these strategies and aligning them with your personal financial goals, you'll optimize your investment distribution effectively. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
