To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your IRA (either traditional or Roth) for tax benefits. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, especially beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Consider Taxes**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate taxable income (like bonds) to avoid high taxes in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify across asset classes. Adjust risk based on your time horizon and investment goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate savings outside these accounts for emergencies before investing all funds.

Regularly assess your financial goals and adjust your contributions as needed. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice.
