To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on tax-deferred growth. If you have high-income years, this can be beneficial.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Choose a Traditional IRA for tax deductions if you're eligible, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that don’t generate high regular income, such as:
   - **Index funds** or **ETFs**, which have lower turnover and thus lower capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-efficient funds**: Look for funds that minimize distributions.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place **bonds** and other interest-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes.
   - Keep **stocks** in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates when held long term.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation and goals.
