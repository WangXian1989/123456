Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, which is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts offer flexibility and can be accessed without penalties. Consider putting investments that generate less taxable income, like index funds or ETFs, here.

4. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, focus on tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA). If you're in a lower bracket, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.

5. **Consider Emergency Funds and Short-Term Goals**: Ensure you have sufficient cash reserves in readily accessible accounts for emergencies or upcoming expenses.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically assess your asset allocation and investment performance to ensure they align with your goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
