Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a trusting relationship can encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Open-ended Questions**: Asking open-ended questions allows suspects to provide information in their own words, promoting more dialogue.

3. **Miranda Warnings**: Officials must inform suspects of their rights before questioning, ensuring they understand their right to remain silent and have legal representation.

4. **Cognitive Interviewing**: This technique encourages witnesses and suspects to recall details by creating a relaxed environment and asking specific, detailed questions.

5. **Good Cop/Bad Cop**: This traditional technique can be used cautiously, ensuring that the bad copâ€™s role does not cross ethical or legal lines.

6. **Non-coercive Techniques**: Using tactics that do not involve threats or physical pressure, such as emphasizing the benefits of cooperation.

7. **Truthful Information**: Providing factual information about the case can sometimes prompt suspects to clarify their involvement.

8. **Psychological Techniques**: Understanding human psychology can help law enforcement frame questions more effectively without manipulation.

These methods are designed to gather information while upholding the legal rights of individuals.
