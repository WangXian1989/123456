Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a balanced approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth depending on your tax situation). This can provide tax advantages and growth potential.

### 3. **Increase Contributions to 401(k)**
   - Once you’ve contributed to your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k). Focus on tax-deferred growth to reduce current taxable income.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - If you've maxed out your retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investing. This offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Pay attention to tax implications of withdrawals from each account type. For example, 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free.

### 6. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes in all accounts to balance risk and growth.

### 7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Periodically review your allocations based on market conditions, changes in income, and life events.
