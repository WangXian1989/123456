Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some tips to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money" that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before investing in taxable accounts. Contributions to these accounts can often grow tax-deferred (401(k)) or tax-free (Roth IRA).

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to your 401(k) and $6,500 to your IRA (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, aim for a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. A mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets can help manage risk and optimize returns.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As market conditions change, your asset allocation may drift from your desired levels. Regularly review your accounts and rebalance if necessary to maintain your target allocation.

6. **Tax Considerations for Withdrawals**: Keep in mind how different account types are taxed upon withdrawal. 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are generally taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

7. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**: Before allocating significant funds to these accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account to cover unexpected expenses.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If youâ€™re uncertain about the best way to allocate your funds, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor. They can help you create a personalized plan based on your unique financial situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will vary based on individual circumstances, including your financial goals and timeline.
