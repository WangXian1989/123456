Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify for a traditional or Roth IRA, consider contributing to it next. IRAs often have better investment options and lower fees compared to many 401(k) plans. 

3. **Max out the 401(k)**: After contributing to the IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This offers tax-deferred growth and reduces your taxable income.

4. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals, but be aware of capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This can help manage risk and potentially enhance returns.

6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Depending on your current and expected future tax situation, you may want to choose between traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free growth) options strategically.

7. **Regular Review**: Make it a habit to review and adjust your investment strategy regularly based on performance, changes in your financial situation, or shifts in the market.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights based on your situation.
