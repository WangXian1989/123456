Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is effectively free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Contributions to a 401(k) grow tax-deferred, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** If your income allows, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you don’t qualify for a Roth, a Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions on your contributions.
   - **Total Contribution Limits:** Be aware of total annual contribution limits for IRAs, which can affect how much you're able to contribute between a Traditional and Roth IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Investment Selection:** Invest in tax-efficient products like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax Loss Harvesting:** You can offset gains by selling losing investments, which may help reduce your tax burden.

### General Distribution Strategy:
- **Age and Risk Tolerance:** Younger investors may lean more towards aggressive growth in 401(k) and IRA accounts, while those near retirement may prioritize income and capital preservation in a taxable account.
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings before maximizing contributions to retirement accounts.
- **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across accounts, considering the tax implications of each type.

### Example Distribution:
- If you're in your 30s: 
   - 401(k): 15% (maximizing the employer match)
   - IRA: 10% (Roth if eligible, otherwise Traditional)
   - Taxable Account: 5% (for short-term or future goals)

- If you're nearing retirement:
   - 401(k): 10% (focusing on stability)
   - IRA: 10% (balance between Traditional and Roth)
   - Taxable Account: 10% (for necessary liquidity)

It’s recommended to periodically review your asset allocations and adjust based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice specific to your situation.
