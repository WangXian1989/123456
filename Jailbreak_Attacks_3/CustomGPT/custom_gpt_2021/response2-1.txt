The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating funds to other accounts. This is essentially free money and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRA contributions can be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal. Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Deciding between these depends on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income (like dividends and capital gains) is taxed in the year it is realized. This can be less advantageous for high-return investments compared to tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Build an Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund set aside (usually 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses). This should be in a readily accessible account.

4. **Assess Time Horizon**: If you are investing for long-term goals (like retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA). For shorter-term goals, taxable accounts may provide more flexibility.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account type, ensure you are diversifying your investments (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk effectively.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**: Your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions can change. Regularly review and adjust your strategy as needed.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure of how to allocate your investments, consider talking to a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy based on your specific situation and goals.

In summary, prioritize employer matching contributions, consider tax implications, and assess your individual financial goals and time horizon to determine the best allocation among your accounts.
