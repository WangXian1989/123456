Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and an excellent return on your investment.
   - **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) contributions. The choice between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA depends on your current tax rate vs. your expected rate in retirement. 

2. **Consider Your Taxes**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should hold investments that are more tax-efficient or those you might need to access before retirement. For example, assets that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains may be more tax-efficient in taxable accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough cash in a high-yield savings account or similar for emergencies (generally 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses) before heavily investing in longer-term accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance. Stocks generally offer higher potential returns but are riskier, while bonds are more stable but offer lower returns.
   - Maintain different asset allocations for different account types. For example, you might choose to hold more aggressive investments in your tax-advantaged accounts (where you're less worried about short-term fluctuations) and more stable investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust your contributions to align with any life changes, market fluctuations, or shifts in your financial goals.

6. **Consider Professional Advice**: If you're uncertain about the best approach, consider consulting a financial advisor who can tailor a distribution strategy specific to your situation.

It's essential to create a balance based on your unique circumstances, so take your time to think it through!
