To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers tax-deferred growth and may include employer matching contributions. It's wise to contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** IRAs offer tax benefits, with traditional IRAs giving you tax deductions upfront and Roth IRAs providing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These allow for more flexible withdrawals, but they don’t provide the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions:** After getting the full match, consider funding your IRA. If your income allows, a Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial for tax-free growth.
   - **Continue Contributions to 401(k):** After your IRA is funded, divert additional savings back to your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit.
   - **Allocate Funds to Taxable Accounts:** Funds can go here for short-term goals or after you have maxed out your retirement accounts.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:** Adjust the risk and types of investments in each account based on your age, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Generally, more aggressive investments can be held in tax-deferred or tax-free accounts to maximize the tax advantages of compound growth.
   - **Asset Location:** Generally, place bonds and other income-generating assets in tax-deferred accounts to minimize tax impacts, while keeping growth-oriented investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Ongoing Review and Adjustments**
   - **Regularly Rebalance Your Portfolio:** As investment values change, periodically review and rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation across accounts.
   - **Stay Informed:** Monitor tax laws and changes in retirement account contribution limits, as these can affect your strategy.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you’re unsure about how to proceed, consider speaking with a financial planner who can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

### Summary
Distributing your money effectively amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves understanding each account's rules, prioritizing contributions, and tailoring your investment strategy based on your unique situation. Regular reviews and adjustments will help keep your financial goals on track.
