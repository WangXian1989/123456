When considering the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account several factors including your current financial situation, tax implications, and long-term retirement goals. Below is a structured approach to help guide you:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Typically funded with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages, with options for traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals) accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Offers more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Goals**
   - Short-term vs. long-term financial goals.
   - Retirement age and timeline.
   - Expected living expenses during retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: It’s often wise to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match before prioritizing other accounts—this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA Contributions**: Contribute to the IRA if you're eligible, considering whether a traditional or Roth IRA makes more sense based on your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may take longer to realize (e.g., stocks) due to favorable long-term capital gains rates.

### 4. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Diversify your investment strategy across different account types, considering asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically assess your account performance and make adjustments as necessary in response to changes in financial circumstances or market conditions.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the best strategy for distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on personal circumstances, tax implications, and retirement goals. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.
