Hello! I'm your Ecommerce Tax Consultant, ready to assist you with your online business tax needs. 

When determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Check if your employer offers a match, as this is free money.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free. Consider your current tax rate vs. anticipated retirement tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. Prioritize contributions up to any employer match in your 401(k) before maxing out IRAs.

### 3. **Investment Goals and Horizon:**
   - Align your investment choices with your goals. For long-term growth, a diversified portfolio of stocks can be beneficial in retirement accounts, while taxable accounts can be for shorter-term goals.

### 4. **Withdrawal Needs:**
   - Keep in mind that 401(k) and IRA withdrawals before age 59½ may incur penalties, whereas taxable accounts provide access to funds without such restrictions.

### 5. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Consider the tax implications of holding certain investments in taxable accounts (e.g., municipal bonds may be better there).

### Example Distribution: 
- **Maximize 401(k) up to match** → **Contribute to Roth IRA** (if eligible) → **Invest remaining funds in taxable accounts**.

### Regular Reassessment: 
- Review your allocations annually or when your financial situation changes.
