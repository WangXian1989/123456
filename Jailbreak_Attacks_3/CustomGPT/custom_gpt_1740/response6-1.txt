To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Tax advantages on contributions or withdrawals, depending on the type. Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but offer flexibility in accessing funds and potential tax-loss harvesting.

### 2. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Allocate funds based on risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across accounts to balance risk.
  
### 3. **Utilize Tax Strategies:**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Focus on contributions to 401(k) and IRA before taxable accounts to benefit from tax incentives.
   - **Tax Diversification:** Spread income across different tax treatments (tax-deferred, tax-free, taxable) for flexibility in retirement.

### 4. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type to optimize contributions effectively.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan for retirement withdrawals considering tax implicationsâ€”withdraw from taxable accounts early and defer tax-advantaged accounts for later.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out employer match, then consider increasing contributions.
- **IRA:** Contribute annually, especially if eligible for Roth benefits.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for short-term goals and maintain liquidity.

### Next Steps:
- Review your current financial situation and adjust allocations based on your specific goals and risk tolerance.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your overall financial plan.

This structured approach can help you optimize your investments while considering tax implications and growth potential.
