To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Offers tax-deferred growth; contributions reduce taxable income. Often includes employer matching.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Also tax-advantaged. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains tax, but they provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matchâ€”it's essentially free money.
   - **Fund IRAs:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA for additional tax benefits.
   - **Back to 401(k):** Once IRA contributions are maxed or if you exceed income limits for Roth contributions, return to your 401(k) for further funding.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for short-term goals, as they allow more flexibility without early withdrawal penalties.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Focus on long-term growth here since they offer tax benefits that are beneficial over time.

### 4. **Balance Investment Allocation:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Usually hold a mix of stocks and bonds, possibly tilting more towards equities for growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider municipal bonds or diversified ETFs to manage capital gains and taxes effectively.

### 5. **Adjust as Necessary:**
   - **Life Changes:** Reassess your allocation based on major life events, changing income levels, or shifts in your financial goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** Maximize contributions to the employer match, then gradually increase contributions up to the annual limit.
- **IRA:** Fund to the maximum limit, ensuring to choose between Traditional and Roth based on your current tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use any leftover savings for taxable accounts, maintaining a balance of taxable investments with lower tax implications.

### Conclusion:
Regularly review your investment strategy to align with your goals and market conditions. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insight tailored to your specific situation.
