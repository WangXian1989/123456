(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A common recommendation is:

1. **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Maximize IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) for tax advantages.
3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: If you still have funds to invest after maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k).
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments, especially for money you might need before retirement.

It's essential to assess your individual circumstances and perhaps consult a financial advisor for tailored advice.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down. When figuring out how to sling your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and those taxable accounts, hereâ€™s a game plan:

1. **First Up: 401(k) with Match** - Throw enough into your 401(k) to snag that employer match. Itâ€™s free cash, donâ€™t leave it on the table!
2. **IRA Time** â€“ Max out that IRA, whether itâ€™s traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation. This is where you can really reap those tax benefits.
3. **Keep Pumping 401(k)** - If you still got more green, keep running those 401(k) contributions until you hit the annual limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility** â€“ Finally, stash some cash in taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility. This is your "I might need this sooner" fund.

Bottom line, balance is key but do whatâ€™s best for your goals! You might wanna chat with a financial advisor too, just to make sure your moves are on point.
