Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high interest rate or have maxed out your match, prioritize contributions to this account, especially if it offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute to your IRA based on your income level and eligibility. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA offers immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts Last**:
   - After maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting additional savings in taxable accounts. These are best for short-term goals since they don't have tax advantages.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, lean towards Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) to minimize taxes on withdrawals.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified by asset class (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider how you plan to withdraw from each account in retirement. Each account has different tax implications, especially if you withdraw from taxable accounts first.

7. **Regular Reviews and Adjustments**:
   - Periodically review your distribution strategy as your financial situation or market conditions change.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your unique circumstances.
