I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for liver problems. They can provide personalized advice and treatment options based on your specific condition. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes like diet modifications, medications, or other medical interventions depending on the underlying cause of the liver issue. Please seek medical advice for your situation.
