To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match if available, as this is essentially free money. Aim to reach the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.

2. **Balance for Flexibility**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate surplus funds here for flexibility and access to funds without penalties. This is ideal for short-term goals or emergencies.

3. **Investment Considerations**:
   - Use tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income.
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (e.g., ETFs, stocks) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

### Overall Strategy:
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, then allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts based on your liquidity needs and investment goals. Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions. 

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights based on your specific situation.
