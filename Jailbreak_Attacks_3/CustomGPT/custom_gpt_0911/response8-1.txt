To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, which is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contributions if possible, especially in a traditional 401(k) for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, max out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Place investments that generate taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities. Stocks that appreciate but donâ€™t pay dividends may be more suitable for taxable accounts due to the lower long-term capital gains tax rate.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Use these for higher-growth investments, as taxes are deferred until withdrawal.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Adjust asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and how close you are to retirement. Younger investors might lean more toward stocks, while those nearing retirement may prefer bonds or more stable investments.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure that your allocations remain in line with your goals, risk tolerance, and market performance by rebalancing your portfolio periodically.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategy for your situation, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your financial goals and circumstances.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts, considering investment types, and aligning your strategy with your financial goals, you can optimize your savings approach.
