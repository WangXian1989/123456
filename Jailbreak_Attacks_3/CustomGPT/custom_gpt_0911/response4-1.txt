Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to receive any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth**: Decide whether to contribute pre-tax or Roth (after-tax), based on your current tax rate versus expected future rate.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Tax Diversification**: Consider having both a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Annual Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and income restrictions for Roth IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Use for Short-Term Goals**: If you need funds for shorter-term goals (like buying a house or vacation), invest here as these accounts offer liquidity.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and return. Consider more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts, where growth can compound without immediate taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.
