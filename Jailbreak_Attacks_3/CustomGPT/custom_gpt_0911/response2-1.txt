Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA can reduce your taxable income now, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund with 3-6 months’ worth of expenses before heavily investing in these accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs. They also provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your investments and ensure your contributions align with any changes in your financial situation or goals.

This approach can help optimize growth and minimize taxes over time. It’s also wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
