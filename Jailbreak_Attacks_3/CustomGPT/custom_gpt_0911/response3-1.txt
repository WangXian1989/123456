Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):**
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
     - Aim to maximize contributions if you’re in a high tax bracket, as contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
     - If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
     - A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions depending on income and participation in an employer plan.

### 2. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid, easily accessible account before heavily investing in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts.
   - Use these for short-term goals or if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals will be taxed.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **High-Growth Investments:** Keep these in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains (e.g., stocks, mutual funds).
   - **Bonds or Income Funds:** Consider holding these in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax on income.

### 5. **Rebalance Portfolio**
   - Regularly review and adjust your investments to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Given individual complexities, consider working with a financial planner to tailor strategies specific to your situation.

By optimizing contributions and considering the tax implications of each account type, you can effectively manage your investment portfolio to support your financial goals.
