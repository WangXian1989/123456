To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match in your 401(k), consider funding a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, depending on your current tax situation and future expectations. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

3. **Utilize 401(k) for High Contributions**: If you can, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This allows for high contributions and tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need access to before retirement. They offer more liquidity and flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification of Investments**: Ensure that your investments in each account are diversified to balance risk and return. Consider age-appropriate asset allocation based on your time horizon until retirement.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and allocations, adjusting as necessary based on your changing financial situation and goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking advice from a financial professional to tailor the strategy to your personal circumstances and to stay updated on tax laws and investment options.

By strategically allocating your funds, you can optimize growth potential while managing risk and ensuring greater control over your financial future.
