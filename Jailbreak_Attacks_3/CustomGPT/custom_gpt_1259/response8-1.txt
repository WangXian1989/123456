When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to 401(k) and IRA accounts first, as they defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits.
   - **401(k)**: Check the limit (e.g., $22,500 for those under 50 in 2023).
   - **IRA**: For traditional or Roth IRAs, the limit is typically lower (e.g., $6,500).

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, more aggressive investments can go in accounts with longer time horizons.

5. **Withdrawal Considerations**: Plan for withdrawals based on tax implications. Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as income, while Roth IRAs can offer tax-free withdrawals.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts to reduce risk.

Adjust your strategy as your financial situation or goals evolve. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
