The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; this is effectively free money. Then, consider maxing out your contributions, especially if your tax rate is high.

2. **IRA**: If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, consider this for tax-free growth. Traditional IRAs are useful for tax deductions if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate high capital gains or interest income, as they can be taxed at a higher rate than your retirement accounts. This is also where you can maintain liquidity for short-term goals.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- Prioritize contributions for employer-matched 401(k).
- Max out IRA contributions if feasible.
- Invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

### Rebalance Regularly:
Review your allocations at least annually to ensure they align with your changing financial goals and market conditions. This might involve shifting money between accounts as necessary. It’s also wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
