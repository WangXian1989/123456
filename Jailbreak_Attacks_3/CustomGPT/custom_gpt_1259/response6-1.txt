To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA for potential tax benefits.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate capital gains and qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. 

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to balance risk and growth according to your financial goals and timeline.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### Conclusion
By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and considering tax implications for your taxable accounts, you can optimize the growth potential of your investments while minimizing your overall tax burden.
