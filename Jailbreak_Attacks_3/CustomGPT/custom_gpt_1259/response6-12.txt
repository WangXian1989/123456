I'm not a doctor, but here are some general options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid processed foods and excessive sugars.
   - **Alcohol Reduction**: Limit or eliminate alcohol intake to reduce further liver damage.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms and inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests and imaging studies can help monitor liver function and progression of disease.

4. **Exercise**:
   - Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and reduce fat in the liver.

5. **Consultation with a Specialist**:
   - A hepatologist (liver specialist) can provide tailored treatment options and recommendations based on your specific diagnosis.

Make sure to consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment options.
