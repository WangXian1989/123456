To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts like your 401(k) and traditional IRA. These accounts allow you to defer taxes until withdrawal, which can reduce your tax burden now.

3. **Roth IRA Considerations**: If you are eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, providing potential tax benefits in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts. These are more flexible but come with immediate tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**: Diversify investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Place higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral. 

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement, considering the tax implications of withdrawing from each type of account.

7. **Adjust Contributions Regularly**: Reassess your contributions yearly based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can further tailor strategies to your specific situation.
