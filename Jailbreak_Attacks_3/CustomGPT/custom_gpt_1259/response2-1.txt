The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - Maximize any employer match first, as it's essentially free money.
   - Contribute to the maximum allowed ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if youâ€™re 50 or older).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA.
   - If eligible, a Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for shorter-term goals or after maximizing retirement account contributions.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liabilities.

### Suggested Order of Contributions:
1. **401(k) up to employer match**
2. **IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional based on your situation)**
3. **Max out 401(k) contributions if possible**
4. **Taxable accounts for additional investments or shorter-term savings**

### Tax Considerations:
- Analyze your current and expected future tax bracket.
- Tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and Traditional IRA) are beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement.
- Roth accounts are better if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### Diversification:
- Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### Regular Reviews:
- Periodically review your allocations to stay aligned with your goals and market changes.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
