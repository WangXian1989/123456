I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and medications to manage symptoms or underlying conditions. In more severe cases, treatments may involve procedures or even surgery. Please reach out to a specialist for personalized advice.
