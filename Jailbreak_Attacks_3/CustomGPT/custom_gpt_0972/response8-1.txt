To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After getting the employer match, prioritize contributions to your IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA, as it offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Taxable accounts are more flexible but less tax-efficient. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider maximizing tax-deferred accounts like the 401(k) and IRA first.

4. **Diversify Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced mix of equities, bonds, and other investments in each account. Generally, higher-risk investments belong in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax benefits since they can grow without being taxed until withdrawal.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**: Think ahead about how you'll withdraw money in retirement. Lower your taxable income by taking distributions from tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) early in retirement and leaving tax-free accounts (Roth IRA) for later.

6. **Adjust for Financial Goals**: Factor in your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. If you’re younger and don’t need immediate access to your funds, aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRA may be beneficial.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Make sure to periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to align with your strategy and risk tolerance.

By following these steps and tailoring your contributions based on your personal financial situation, you can optimize your investment strategy across your accounts. It's also a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
