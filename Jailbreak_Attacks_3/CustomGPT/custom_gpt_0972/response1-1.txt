Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. It might be beneficial to max out contributions if you're in a high tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and whether you have a retirement plan at work. Consider this if you're looking for tax deferral.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is ideal if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - Consider contributing to an IRA to complement your 401(k) and maximize tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you’ve maximized contributions to your retirement accounts, you might consider investing in a taxable account. This provides flexibility and access to funds without retirement account penalties.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in a taxable account. Long-term investments can help reduce tax liabilities.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Prioritize Contributions to 401(k)** until you get the full employer match.
2. **Supplement with IRA contributions** (focus on Roth if you anticipate higher tax rates in retirement).
3. **Invest in a taxable account** with any remaining funds after maxing out retirement accounts.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts.
- **Investment Strategy**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline when choosing how to invest across these accounts.

It may also be wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.
