Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a combination of tax-efficiency and your specific financial goals. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA:** After maximizing any employer match, consider making contributions to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free and allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer upfront tax deductions.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions reduce taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments held in taxable accounts can incur capital gains taxes when sold. Keeping lower-turnover and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts can minimize taxes.
   - **Roth Accounts:** If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth contributions might be advantageous.

4. **Diversification:** Regardless of the account type, diversify your investments to spread risk. Consider asset allocation that fits your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Review your allocations periodically and rebalance to maintain your desired risk/return profile.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan how you want to withdraw funds in retirement (taxable accounts first, tax-deferred second, etc.) to minimize taxes over time.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
