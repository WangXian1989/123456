I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options that are often considered for liver problems. It's crucial, however, that you consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising regularly can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the underlying cause of your liver issues, medications may be prescribed to manage conditions such as hepatitis or fatty liver disease.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Manage Underlying Conditions**: Treating related health issues like diabetes or high cholesterol can alleviate stress on the liver.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases where liver function is critically impaired, a transplant may be necessary.

6. **Nutritional Support**: Consulting a dietitian who specializes in liver health can be beneficial for meal planning and nutritional support.

Again, please speak with a healthcare provider to discuss your specific situation and develop an appropriate treatment plan.
