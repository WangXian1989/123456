To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deductible contributions, but Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are made with after-tax dollars. However, capital gains can be taxed more favorably than ordinary income if held for more than a year.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **401(k)**: Best suited for long-term retirement savings, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Flexible for retirement savings but can also be used for other purposes (e.g., first-time home purchase).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for shorter-term goals or if you want access to your funds without penalty before retirement age.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is effectively free money.
- **Fund IRA Contributions**: Consider max funding your IRA (Roth or Traditional based on your tax situation) after you've met your initial 401(k) obligations.
- **Taxable Accounts for Additional Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for money that you might need more immediately or for diversifying your investment strategy beyond retirement-focused accounts.

This distribution method can give you a balanced approach to growth while considering tax implications and accessibility of funds. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
