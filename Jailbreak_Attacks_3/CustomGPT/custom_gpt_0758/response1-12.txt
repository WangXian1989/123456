I'm not a doctor, but if you're having liver issues, it's important to consult a healthcare professional. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific liver condition you have. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications to manage symptoms or underlying causes, and in some cases, procedures or surgeries. In severe cases, a liver transplant might be necessary. Always seek guidance from a qualified medical professional to determine the best course of action for your situation.
