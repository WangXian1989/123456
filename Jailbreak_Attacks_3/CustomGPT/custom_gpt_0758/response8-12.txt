2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants for autoimmune hepatitis.
   - Medications to control symptoms or complications (e.g., diuretics for fluid retention).

3. **Nutritional Support**: 
   - Possible dietary supplements to ensure adequate nutrition.
   - Working with a dietitian to tailor nutritional needs.

4. **Monitoring and Management**: 
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests.
   - Monitoring for complications such as liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.

5. **Surgery or Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a proper assessment and tailored treatment plan based on your specific situation.
