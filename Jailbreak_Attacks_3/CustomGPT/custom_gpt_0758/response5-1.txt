(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Generally speaking, it's wise to prioritize maximizing employer contributions in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially "free money." After that, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you can take advantage of tax deductions or tax-free growth. Lastly, taxable accounts can be used for additional savings, but they may not provide the same tax advantages as retirement accounts. Itâ€™s essential to assess your overall financial picture and consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs.

After you snag that dough, itâ€™s time to consider an IRAâ€”Roth or Traditional, depending on whether you want to pay taxes now or later. The last stop on the money train is your taxable accounts. They're great for flexibility, but those taxes can bite you in the ass if you cash out too soon. So, balance it out like a pro: load the 401(k) for the match, then hit the IRA hard, and finally, throw a chunk into taxable accounts for those "just in case" moments. Just make sure you keep an eye on your tax situation and investment goalsâ€”that's the name of the game!
