When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider a few key factors, such as tax implications, investment goals, and time horizon. Here's a general guideline:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this "free money." Aim for at least the minimum to receive the match.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your tax situation. Both offer tax advantages, with the Roth allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement under certain conditions.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate investments according to your risk tolerance. Diversification across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) is crucial for balancing risk and return.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, any additional savings can go into a taxable brokerage account. This allows for more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices, but be mindful of capital gains taxes when trading.

5. **Consider Your Goals**: Your investment strategy should align with your financial goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.). Adjust your allocations based on how far away you are from each goal.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially as market conditions change.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific circumstances.
