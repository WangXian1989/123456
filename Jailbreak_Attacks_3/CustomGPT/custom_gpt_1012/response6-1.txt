Distributing your money among different account types like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-term needs**: Use taxable accounts for easier access to funds.

### 2. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; consider maxing out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Open a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Max out contributions if eligible.

### 3. **Balance Investment Options**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on diversified funds or low-cost index funds.
   - **IRA**: Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments based on risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments with favorable tax treatment, such as ETFs or tax-efficient mutual funds.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-deferred accounts** (401(k) and Traditional IRA): Taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Taxes on dividends and capital gains apply annually.

### 5. **Monitoring and Adjusting**
   - Regularly review asset allocation and rebalance as needed.
   - Adjust contributions based on life changes (e.g., salary increases, changes in financial goals).

#### Conclusion
Distributing your funds wisely can optimize growth while managing tax liabilities. It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation.
