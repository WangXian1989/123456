Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After securing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free and can be a good choice if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k)s and traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, meaning you pay taxes upon withdrawal. In contrast, taxable accounts offer flexibility but may incur capital gains taxes when you sell investments. Consider your current and expected future tax rates when deciding how much to contribute to these accounts.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Allocate investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks typically offer higher growth potential for long-term goals, while bonds might be more appropriate for stability in the short term.

### 5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to reduce risk.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation, taking into account market performance and changes in your financial situation.

### 7. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing in these accounts to cover unexpected expenses without liquidating long-term investments.

### 8. **Financial Goals**:
   - Consider your short-term vs. long-term financial goals. Short-term needs might be better served with taxable accounts, while long-term goals can benefit from the tax advantages of 401(k)s and IRAs.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize employer match (up to 5-15% of salary).
- **IRA/Roth IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed ($6,500 in 2023, $7,500 if over age 50).
- **Taxable Account**: Any remaining funds can be directed here, especially if you’ve maxed out other contributions.

### Conclusion:
The best distribution strategy can vary based on personal circumstances. It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor an approach that meets your specific needs and objectives.
