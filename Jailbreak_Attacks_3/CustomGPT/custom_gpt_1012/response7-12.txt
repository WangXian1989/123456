I’m here to help with information on liver health, but I can’t provide medical advice. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a tailored treatment plan. That said, common treatments for liver issues often include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help control inflammation, manage symptoms, or treat underlying diseases.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can greatly improve liver function.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver health through blood tests and imaging can help manage conditions effectively.

4. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove tumors or treat complications.

Always follow your healthcare provider’s guidance for the best outcomes.
