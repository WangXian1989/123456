Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - After maximizing employer match and IRA contributions, continue to invest in your 401(k). The tax deferral can be beneficial for high-income earners.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for more flexible investing, especially for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement age. Be mindful of capital gains and taxes on dividends.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across these accounts to balance risk and return. Generally, higher risk investments might be more suitable for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments could be placed in taxable accounts for liquidity.

6. **Withdrawals and Tax Strategy**:
   - Plan how withdrawals will be taxed. Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while withdrawals from Roth IRAs are tax-free, and capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at capital gains rates.

7. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
