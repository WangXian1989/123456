To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money. Once that's maxed out, redirect your focus to your IRA.

2. **IRA Types**: If you have a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it a great option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need in the short term or for goals such as a home purchase. They provide flexibility but be mindful of capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider placing higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your IRA or 401(k)), and more stable investments (like bonds) in your taxable account to minimize taxes on interest income.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you will draw down these accounts in retirement. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can be beneficial in minimizing taxable income over time.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your personal situation and goals.
