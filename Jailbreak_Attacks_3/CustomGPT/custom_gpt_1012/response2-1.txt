Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute as much as possible up to annual limits. Consider if your plan offers a Roth option.
   - **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k), contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.
   - Note that IRA contributions have income limits, especially for Roth IRAs.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investment strategies that are not tax-efficient (like high-frequency trading or active management).
   - Keep tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs here, as they generally produce lower capital gains.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Withdrawals from a Traditional 401(k) or IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Consider your expected tax bracket in retirement when deciding where to prioritize contributions.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Make sure you have a liquid emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a savings account, separate from investment accounts.

### 6. **Adjust for Goals**:
   - If you're saving for a specific goal within a certain timeframe, consider the right balance of risk and investment type based on when you'll need the money.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on performance and any changes in your personal financial situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of income (up to employer match)
- **IRA**: Max out individual contribution limits
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining funds after tax-advantaged accounts
