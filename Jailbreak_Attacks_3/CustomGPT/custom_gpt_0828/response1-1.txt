Balancing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is all about your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here's a quick breakdown to help you distribute your money effectively:

1. **401(k) Plan**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s free money! 
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth. Higher-risk investments might do well here since you won’t be taxed on gains until withdrawal.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If you have a Traditional IRA, it provides tax-deferred growth, just like your 401(k). Consider using it for assets you expect to grow significantly.
   - A Roth IRA, on the other hand, allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This could be great for your lower-risk investments or those you anticipate will appreciate and be taxed heavily if withdrawn later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for funds you might need access to before retirement or for investments generating taxable income (like dividends). 
   - Consider holding investments with lower turnover or those that are tax-efficient here. 

**Distribution Tips**:
- A common strategy is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth, while using taxable accounts for short-to-medium-term goals.
- Regularly rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changing financial needs.

Everyone's situation is unique—consider consulting with a financial planner to tailor your strategy. Happy investing!
