Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and timeline for withdrawals. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and provides an excellent return on your investment.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: Contribute to your IRA (either traditional or Roth) up to the allowed limit. These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly impact your long-term growth.
   - **401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA contributions, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k).

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on them until withdrawal.
   - Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts can serve as a good option for investments that you may want to access before retirement without penalties.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a separate cash reserve in a savings account to cover 3-6 months of expenses before tying all your money into investment accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account type, diversify among asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you near retirement (or your goal), consider how you'll withdraw funds. Typically, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and leave tax-free accounts for last.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation, helping you balance current tax implications and future growth.

Overall, the key is to balance contributing to tax-advantaged accounts while ensuring enough liquidity for your needs. Always review your strategy periodically to adjust for life changes or shifts in your financial situation.
