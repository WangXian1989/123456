Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to your IRA, whether it's a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Traditional IRAs give you a tax deduction now, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue with 401(k) Contributions**: If you still have funds to allocate after funding your IRA, continue maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you have a high income. The contributions are pre-tax, thus lowering your taxable income for the year.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment options but come with the tax implications on earnings.

5. **Balance and Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired allocation.

6. **Consider Fees and Investment Options**: Be mindful of the fees associated with each type of account and the investment options available. Sometimes, 401(k)s have higher fees or limited options that could impact your overall investment returns.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about how to allocate your investments based on your unique financial situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Building a well-structured plan will ensure that you are taking advantage of the benefits each type of account offers while aligning with your long-term financial goals. Happy investing!
