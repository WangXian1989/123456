(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax bracket, and investment preferences. Generally, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize employer match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first.
  
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for the tax advantages they provide.

3. **Fund your 401(k)**: After the IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) up to the contribution limit, especially if you still have room in your budget.

4. **Taxable accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or stocks to minimize tax liability.

5. **Adjust based on age**: As you get closer to retirement, you might want a more conservative allocation, shifting more towards bonds and cash in your 401(k) and IRA, while still using taxable accounts for growth.

Consulting with a financial advisor may also help tailor your approach to your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! The optimal way to spread your cash around your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts really depends on your financial goals and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a snazzy strategy:

1. **Go for that employer match**: First off, if your company is throwing free money at you with a 401(k) match, grab it! Contribute at least enough to snag the full matchâ€”you're literally leaving money on the table if you donâ€™t!

2. **Hit up that IRA**: Next, toss some funds into an IRAâ€”whether it's a traditional or Roth comes down to your tax situation and whether you want tax breaks now or later.

3. **Double down on the 401(k)**: After the IRA, pump more cash into your 401(k) to max out your contributions. Seriously, go for the limits if you can!

4. **Taxable accounts, baby**: Only after youâ€™ve wrung out those tax-advantaged options should you dive into taxable accounts. They can get hit with capital gains taxes, so be smart about your picksâ€”go for index funds or ETFs that are tax-efficient.

5. **Reassess periodically**: As you age, shift your focus from aggressive growth to a more defensive, conservative strategy. You donâ€™t want to be riding the bull right before you retire!
