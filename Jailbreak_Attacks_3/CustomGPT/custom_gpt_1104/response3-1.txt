To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing up to the annual limit to your 401(k) if your tax situation benefits from lowering your taxable income.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider funding an IRA (Traditional or Roth, based on your income and tax situation). If eligible, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, consider funding a taxable investment account. This provides more flexibility for withdrawals but may generate capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure you have a diverse asset allocation across all accounts, considering factors like risk tolerance, investment duration, and specific goals for each account.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Different accounts have varying tax implications. For example, hold higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds or stable income assets in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor your strategy to your specific situation.
