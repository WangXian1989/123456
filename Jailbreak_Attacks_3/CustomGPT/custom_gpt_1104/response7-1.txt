Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This often provides an immediate return on investment. Focus on tax-deferred growth, and consider a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). Contribute to maximize tax-advantage opportunities. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that may generate taxable income, like dividends or short-term capital gains. Consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize tax liability. This account can provide flexibility for short-term goals.

**General Tips**:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have cash reserves before heavily investing.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a balance of asset classes across all accounts to reduce risk.
- **Regular Review**: Periodically assess your portfolio to adjust for changing needs or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
