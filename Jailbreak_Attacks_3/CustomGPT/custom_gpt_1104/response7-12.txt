1. **Medication**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications can help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
2. **Lifestyle changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
3. **Weight management**: If overweight, losing weight can reduce fatty liver disease.
4. **Regular monitoring**: Keeping up with follow-up appointments and blood tests to track liver function.

Please reach out to a healthcare provider to discuss your symptoms and get a proper diagnosis.
