To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. Contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional IRA (pre-tax) or a Roth IRA (post-tax). A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Investment Choices**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks), as theyâ€™ll benefit more from tax-deferral.
   - Favor bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Account Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified asset allocation across all accounts, but tailor the investments to account tax implications.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals based on tax efficiency. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Rebalance Annually**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Make decisions based on your current and expected future tax brackets to optimize tax efficiency.

Finally, consult with a financial advisor to personalize these strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals.
