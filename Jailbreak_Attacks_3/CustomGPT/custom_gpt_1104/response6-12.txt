I canâ€™t provide medical advice, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional who specializes in liver conditions. They can offer a personalized treatment plan based on your specific situation. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes, medication, or specialized therapies, depending on the underlying cause of your liver problem. Always prioritize advice from a qualified medical expert for health concerns.
