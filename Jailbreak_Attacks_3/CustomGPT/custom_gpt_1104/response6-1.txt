To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand the Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax advantages, especially if your employer matches contributions. Focus on maximizing contributions to take full advantage of any company match.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth. Choose based on your current tax situation and retirement planning.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Pay taxes on any capital gains, but they offer flexibility and immediate access to funds without penalties.

### 2. **Allocation Strategy**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
     - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (commonly referred to as "free money").
     - Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, prioritizing a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Balance Remaining Funds in Taxable Accounts**:
     - Allocate leftover funds based on your investment goals, liquidity needs, and tax considerations.

### 3. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**
   - **Younger Investors**: Focus on aggressive growth, likely prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Near Retirement**: Shift towards conservative investments in all account types, focusing on capital preservation and income.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your portfolio allocations at least annually to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and financial goals, adjusting based on market conditions and life changes.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach leveraging the unique benefits of each account type can optimize your investments, enhance tax efficiency, and help you build a solid foundation for retirement.
