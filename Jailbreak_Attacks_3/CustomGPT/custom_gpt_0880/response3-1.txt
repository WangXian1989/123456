Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These are tax-advantaged accounts. Contributions are often pre-tax (401(k)) or tax-deductible (Traditional IRA), and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains in these accounts are taxed in the year they’re realized.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA up to their limits to benefit from any employer matching in your 401(k) and tax deductions with your IRA.
   
3. **Investment Choices**:
   - Select investments for your tax-advantaged accounts that benefit from tax deferral, such as bonds and high-growth equities.
   - In your taxable account, consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains distributions.

4. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you’re younger, prioritize maximizing your 401(k) for employer matches and Roth IRAs if eligible for tax-free growth.
   - As retirement nears, shift focus to taxable accounts to allow more flexibility in withdrawals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax implications when withdrawing. Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

**General Strategy**:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
2. Max out your IRA contributions (consider Roth vs. Traditional based on your tax situation).
3. Invest additional funds in taxable accounts with a focus on tax efficiency.

By balancing contributions based on these factors, you can optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively. Consulting a financial advisor is also advisable for personalized strategies.
