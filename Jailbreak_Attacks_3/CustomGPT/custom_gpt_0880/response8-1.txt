Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if it offers tax deductions or tax-free growth.

2. **Prioritize Taxable Accounts Last**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you plan to hold for shorter periods since you'll be taxed on any capital gains. This can include individual stocks or bonds.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize contributing to tax-deferred accounts (401(k) or traditional IRA) to lower your taxable income.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth accounts (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) for tax-free withdrawals later.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate your investments within these accounts based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals to balance growth potential and stability.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance, changing goals, or shifts in risk tolerance.

6. **Account Types Matter**:
   - Consider the types of investments within each account. For example, hold high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts and slower-growing income-generating assets in taxable accounts to defer taxes on larger gains.

By following these guidelines, you can maximize your savings' growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
