Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches:** If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match—it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Prioritize contributions to these accounts due to their tax advantages. Aim to max out your IRA if eligible, and then contribute more to your 401(k).
   - **Traditional vs. Roth:** Choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth) based on your current tax rate vs. expected future tax rate.

3. **Build Emergency Savings:** Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved in an easily accessible account before heavily investing in taxable accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts Last:** Use these for additional investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. While they don’t have the same tax benefits, they offer flexibility.

5. **Consider Fees and Investment Options:** Review the fees associated with your 401(k) and IRAs. Choose investments that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Periodically:** Keep an eye on your allocations across accounts to ensure they align with your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice tailored to your situation.

This balanced approach helps you optimize the benefits of each account type while preparing for a financially secure retirement.
