Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
   - Max out your IRA contributions if eligible (Traditional or Roth).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed on capital gains and dividends, so consider holding long-term investments to reduce tax liabilities.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk.
   - Use tax-efficient funds in your taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

4. **Withdrawals Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize tax impacts, considering the order of withdrawals (e.g., taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow).

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Keep some liquid assets in your taxable accounts for emergencies separate from retirement funds.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - They can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Balancing these elements can help you build a solid investment strategy.
