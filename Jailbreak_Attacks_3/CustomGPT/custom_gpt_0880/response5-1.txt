(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your income, tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):** Maximize any employer match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Consider contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Contribute to an IRA if you're eligible. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, while a traditional IRA can provide an immediate tax deduction.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for money you might need before retirement or for more flexible investment options. Capital gains tax applies here, so be mindful of the timing of your investments.

A balanced approach might involve maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions first, then allocating any remaining funds to taxable accounts.

1. **401(k):** First off, snag that employer match; itâ€™s like striking gold! Go for the max contribution if you can - itâ€™s pre-tax, so youâ€™re saving tax bucks today.

2. **IRA:** Dive into that IRA game! If you're looking at a Roth IRA, itâ€™s sweet for tax-free growth down the line. If you're more about deductions now, a traditional IRA can save you some serious cash.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once youâ€™ve milked the retirement accounts dry, slide some cash into taxable accounts. They give you flexibility and access to your money without penalties - just keep an eye on those capital gains!

So, load up your 401(k) and IRAs first, then let those taxable accounts fill up with any extra cash. It's all about finding that sweet spot for you!
