To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is free money. Aim to max out your contribution limit if possible ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA next. For 2024, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50). Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Consider your current tax bracket and future income expectations. Higher contributions to tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) might benefit you if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts Strategically**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility. This is useful if you need access to funds before retirement age without penalties. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or tax-managed funds.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure you have a diversified investment mix across all accounts to manage risk. Stocks, bonds, and other assets should be spread out based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations as needed to align with your financial goals and market changes.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - Strategically plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement. Ideally, tap into taxable accounts first for tax efficiency, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts.
