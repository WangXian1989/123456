I'm not a healthcare professional, but I can suggest general treatment options that are typically discussed with medical professionals regarding liver problems. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice. Here are some common treatment options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This may include adopting a healthier diet, exercise, and weight management.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications can help manage symptoms or stop disease progression.
3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Abstaining from alcohol can prevent further liver damage.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Periodic check-ups and blood tests can track liver health.
5. **Management of Underlying Conditions**: Treating conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol can also benefit liver health.
6. **In severe cases**: Liver transplant may be necessary for life-threatening liver diseases.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment options based on your specific condition.
