To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth). Withdrawals in retirement may be taxed at your ordinary income rate (traditional).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income is subject to capital gains taxes. Long-term capital gains can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess whether you are saving for short, medium, or long-term goals. This influences your asset allocation and which accounts to prioritize for specific investments.
  
3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs, which can affect how much you can allocate to each account type.

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Taxable accounts offer the most flexibility for withdrawals since there are no penalties for accessing funds at any age.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first as it is essentially free money.
- **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
  - If you are eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
  - Contribute to your traditional IRA or pre-tax 401(k) to reduce taxable income.
- **Invest Remaining Funds in Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, allocate excess funds to taxable accounts for liquidity.

### Example of Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 30% of your total investment
- **Traditional or Roth IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 40%

### Conclusion:
This strategy can be adjusted depending on individual circumstances and financial goals. It is often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor the distribution based on your specific situation.
