To optimize your investment strategy and distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize funding your 401(k) up to the match limit. This is essentially "free money" for your retirement.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Consider funding your IRA (Traditional or Roth) after maximizing the employer match. Roth IRAs can offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, making them a great option if you're eligible. Traditional IRAs may provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts for easier access to funds in case of emergencies or short-term goals. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts benefit from tax-deferred growth, so prioritize investments in higher growth assets here since you won't pay taxes on the growth until withdrawal.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative assets to balance growth and income.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement, considering tax impacts. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can be advantageous, allowing tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your investment allocations to maintain your desired risk level and align with your long-term goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor who can provide tailored strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you'll develop a balanced approach to distributing your money amongst your retirement and taxable accounts effectively.
