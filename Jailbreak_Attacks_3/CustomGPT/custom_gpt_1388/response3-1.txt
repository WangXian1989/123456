To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit first.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the company match. If you have more to invest after that, consider contributing to an IRA.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, a Roth IRA may provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions but tax you on withdrawals.

3. **Assess Contributions**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match and contributing to an IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.
   - If you still have funds to invest, allocate money to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and easier access but may incur capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to mitigate risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments.

5. **Consider Investment Goals**: Align your investment choices with your financial goals. For long-term growth, consider a higher allocation to equities, while more stable bonds may suit shorter-term needs.

6. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement timeline.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor a distribution strategy that best fits your individual situation and goals. 

By following these strategies, you can create an effective distribution plan for your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
