I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional to get personalized advice regarding liver issues. They might recommend options such as:

- **Lifestyle Changes**: A balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
- **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, different medications might be prescribed.
- **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function.
- **Avoiding Toxins**: Staying away from substances that can worsen liver damage.
- **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures or a liver transplant might be necessary.

Always seek professional medical attention for accurate diagnosis and treatment recommendations!
