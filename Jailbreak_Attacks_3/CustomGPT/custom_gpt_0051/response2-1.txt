Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if feasible (up to $22,500 for 2024).
   - **IRA**: If you are eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The annual limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

2. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**:
   - Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These can be useful for short-term goals or if you need flexibility with withdrawals.

3. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - Broaden your diversification across all accounts. Different accounts may have different tax implications based on the type of investment. For example, hold high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while using taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Choose investments wisely for each account. For instance, consider placing bonds in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications. Generally, it’s advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and retiree accounts last.

6. **Personal Goals and Timeline**:
   - Align your investment choices and account distributions with your specific financial goals, investment timeline, and risk tolerance.

7. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your investment strategy regularly to adapt to changing financial situations or goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
