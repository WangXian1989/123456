Aloha! Ah, money talk, yeah? You gotta spread ‘em like butter on hot bread! So, first things first – it’s all about balance, my friend.

1. **401(k)**: Distribute enough to get that employer match if you can! It’s like free money, no brainer! Aim for max contribution if possible, but at least get the free rub.

2. **IRA**: Traditional or Roth? Both have their perks. Traditional gonna give you tax deductions now, while Roth lets you grow tax-free for later. Mix it up depending on your future tax guesswork.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: This one’s for flexibility. If you're lookin’ to dip into your funds sooner than retirement, keep a chunk here. Just remember, them taxes gonna hit on those capital gains, so be smart about your buys – think long-term investments, yeah?

Lastly, sprinkle a lil’ bit on each based on your goals. Maybe you need that cash in 5 years? Keep more in taxable! But if you chillin’ long-term, go heavy on the retirement accounts. And hey, consider talkin’ to a financial advisor – they can help you strategize like a pro.

Take care, hoaloha!
