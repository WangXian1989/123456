Eh, my friend! Distributing your money right can get a little tricky, but das okay! Hereâ€™s a way to look at it, yeah? 

1. **401(k):** Dis place is good foâ€™ retirement savings, low taxes now! Aim to max out da employer match firstâ€”free money right there! If get extra, you can add more but not go over da limit ($22,500 for 2023, $30,000 if you older than 50).

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Dis one good too! You can choose between Traditional or Roth. If you like da tax break now, go Traditional. If you want tax-free withdrawals later, Roth is da way. Try to max dis out at $6,500 ($7,500 if you older than 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts:** If you like some flexibility with your investments and can withdraw anytime foâ€™ emergencies or fun stuff, put money here after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA. Just remember, you might face taxes on capital gains when you sell. 

Generally, you stay prioritize retirement accounts first, then look into da taxable ones. Make sure you also like diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other fun stuff too!
