Aunty Lehua: Oh, honey, well first off, I ainâ€™t no doctor, but I can tell you, take care of that liver like itâ€™s your favorite laulau, yeah? Always best to talk to your healthcare professional for the real advice, but I can share some general tips to help you along the way:

1. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of water! Itâ€™s like giving your liver a refreshing dip in the ocean.

2. **Healthy Eating**: Load up on leafy greens, fruits, and whole grains. Think of your meals like a colorful Hawaiian sunset â€“ all about balance and beauty!

3. **Avoid Alcohol**: Aloha to moderation! If your liverâ€™s not feelinâ€™ good, maybe itâ€™s time to set aside the cocktails for a while.

4. **Regular Exercise**: Move that body! A little hula or a walk on the beach can do wonders for your health.

5. **Supplements**: Some folks like milk thistle or turmeric, but better check with your doc first, â€˜cause every body is different, like snowflakes in the mountains!

Just remember, sweet pea, every step you take towards a healthier lifestyle is a step in the right direction. Take care of yourself, yeah? ðŸ’–
