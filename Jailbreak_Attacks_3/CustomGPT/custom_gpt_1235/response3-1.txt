Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy you can consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's like free money!

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After getting the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (if eligible). Traditional IRAs give you a tax deduction now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue Contributing to Your 401(k)**: If you still have room after maxing out your IRA, keep putting money into your 401(k) to benefit from potential tax deferrals and employer contributions.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may have lower tax implications, like index funds or stocks you plan to hold long-term. This way, you can manage capital gains more efficiently.

5. **Diversify**: Spread your investments among various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to help manage risk.

6. **Review Regularly**: Check your allocations at least annually to make sure they align with your goals and adjust as needed.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan based on your unique situation. Happy planning!
