To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to obtain any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Asset Allocation Strategy:**
   - **Stocks vs. Bonds**: Keep more aggressive investments like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from deferred taxes. 
   - **Bonds in Taxable Accounts**: Place income-generating assets like bonds in your taxable accounts where they may be taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - Evaluate your current and expected future tax brackets to decide how much to allocate to each type of account.

4. **Review Regularly:**
   - Reassess your asset distribution as your financial situation or tax laws change to ensure alignment with your long-term goals.

Before implementing any investment strategy, you may want to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal financial situation.
