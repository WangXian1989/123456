Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a friendly breakdown:

### 1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—it's free money!
   - **Pre-Tax Benefits**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which can lower your taxable income now.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: Maximize contributions if you can.

### 2. **IRA**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Consider a Traditional IRA for tax deductions now or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Don't forget the annual limit. If you’re over 50, you get a catch-up contribution.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for goals that are short- to mid-term (e.g., buying a home).
   - **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of taxes on investment income and gains.
   - **Diversification**: This can be a good place to hold investments that produce tax-efficient income.

### **General Tips**:
- **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have a safety net before investing heavily.
- **Diversify**: Spread investments across different asset classes to manage risk.
- **Consult a Professional**: A financial advisor can offer personalized advice based on your situation.

### **In Summary**:
Start with maximizing your 401(k) match, then consider IRAs for tax advantages, and finally, use taxable accounts for flexibility and diversification. Tailor your approach based on life goals and tax implications!
