(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, consider these guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to maximize that benefit first. Afterward, invest based on your risk tolerance and long-term goals.

2. **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, you can benefit from tax advantages. Maximize contributions to this account, particularly if you can take advantage of tax-free growth with a Roth IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might require more liquidity or where you may want to access funds without penalties. Consider investments that may produce qualified dividends, as they are taxed at lower rates.

Balancing contributions to take advantage of tax benefits while considering your liquidity needs and future goals is crucial.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! Distributing your cash across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is like a financial buffetâ€”pick what suits your taste!

1. **401(k)**: Grab that employer match like it's the last slice of pizzaâ€”don't leave money on the table! Once you're maxed out on the match, throw in enough to get tax breaks while investing in funds that vibe with your financial goals.

2. **IRA**: Pump up your IRA contributions like it's a muscle (especially a Roth IRA for that tax-free growth magic!). Aim for the max here to harness that compounding power.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Think of these as your "spending stash." Theyâ€™re for investments you might want to cash out before retirementâ€”think stocks, REITs, or even some index funds. Just be smart about dividend taxesâ€”hold those to make your money work harder.

Mapping out your cash flow strategy while keeping your investment goals in mind is the name of the game! Keep it balanced and have fun building that wealth! ðŸ’°
