Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few key factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match—it's essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it’s a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Favor tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for any investments you may need access to before retirement.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and perhaps target-date funds to maintain diversification aligned with your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Maintain an Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure liquidity by keeping enough cash or equivalents in your taxable accounts to cover 3-6 months of expenses, separate from investments.

### 5. **Reevaluate Regularly**
   - Regularly review and adjust your distributions based on market performance, tax laws, and changes in your financial situation.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions among these accounts with a strategic focus on tax efficiency and your personal financial goals will provide a solid foundation for long-term wealth growth.
