I'm not a medical professional, but I can offer some general suggestions. For liver issues, it's crucial to consult a healthcare provider for a personalized assessment. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Medication:** Depending on the specific liver condition, doctors might prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (like antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

2. **Lifestyle Changes:** 
   - Adopting a healthy diet (rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains).
   - Avoiding alcohol and limiting processed foods to reduce liver strain.

3. **Regular Monitoring:** Routine check-ups to track liver function and adjust treatment as necessary.

4. **Possible Procedures:** In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or, in extreme situations, liver transplantation might be considered.

Always seek guidance from a qualified healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plans.
