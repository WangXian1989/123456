Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (for tax-free withdrawals) or a traditional IRA (for tax-deferred growth).
   - **401(k)**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) after maximizing your match, especially if it offers a diversified range of investments.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional savings into a taxable account. This provides flexibility and easy access to funds without early withdrawal penalties.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in a savings account or similar vehicle for unexpected expenses.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Consider your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals when choosing specific investments.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.
