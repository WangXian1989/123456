I'm not a doctor, but here are some common options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet low in fat and sugar.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**
   - **Antiviral drugs**: For viral hepatitis, medications like interferons may be prescribed.
   - **Corticosteroids**: For autoimmune liver disease, these can reduce inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring**
   - **Checkups**: Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Procedures**
   - **Liver transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
