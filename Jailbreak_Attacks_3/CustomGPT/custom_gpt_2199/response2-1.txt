Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k) contribution, consider funding a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax strategy and eligibility.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income (like ETFs or index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. 

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts to manage risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align each account with specific goals (e.g., retirement, short-term savings). Use 401(k) and IRA funds primarily for retirement, while your taxable accounts can be more flexible.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on market conditions, personal circumstances, and changing goals.

Overall, the key is to balance maximizing tax-efficiency while meeting your long-term financial goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
