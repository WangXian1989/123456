The best way to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your contribution (up to the limit) as it offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA based on your income level and tax goals. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to 401(k) and IRA, invest in taxable accounts. This is useful for liquidity and short-term needs.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments in these accounts are well-diversified across asset classes to manage risk effectively.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on market conditions, tax law changes, and personal financial situations.

Consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice can also be beneficial.
