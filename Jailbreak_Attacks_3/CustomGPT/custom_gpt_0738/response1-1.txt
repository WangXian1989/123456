Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, consider maxing out your contributions for deferred tax growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. A traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax rates (like long-term capital gains) or tax-efficient funds (like index funds and ETFs).

3. **Short-Term vs. Long-Term Goals**:
   - For **short-term goals** (less than 5 years), lean towards taxable accounts to access funds without penalties.
   - For **long-term goals**, favor tax-advantaged accounts for the growth benefits.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a mix of assets (stocks, bonds) across all accounts to balance risk and return according to your age and risk tolerance.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal circumstances vary greatly, so consider getting professional advice tailored to your specific situation.

By striking the right balance, you can optimize your tax efficiency and prepare effectively for retirement.
