Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Take Advantage of Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maximizing contributions, especially if your tax rate is higher now than you expect it to be in retirement. Traditional 401(k) contributions are tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for upfront tax deductions. The choice depends on whether you expect to be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Fill Taxable Accounts Last**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts. These accounts donâ€™t offer the same tax benefits but provide more flexibility for withdrawals.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified. Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds) to minimize tax impact.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of how withdrawals will affect your taxable income. Withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains from taxable accounts may be taxed at a lower rate.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation and alignment with your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

Implementing these strategies can help you optimize your savings and investment growth over time.
