Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or Roth IRAs before investing in taxable accounts. These accounts can provide tax benefits that taxable accounts do not.

3. **Consider Tax Rates**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial since contributions are made after-tax and withdrawals are tax-free. For a traditional IRA or 401(k), contributions are made pre-tax, which provides immediate tax relief but will be taxed upon withdrawal.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly check the performance of your investments and adjust your allocations as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Consider how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Strategies may involve withdrawing from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

By carefully evaluating these factors, you can create a balanced distribution that aligns with your financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights tailored to your situation.
