To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Diversify Account Types:** 
   - Fund your 401(k) up to the match.
   - Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible, to benefit from tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investing.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions reduce your taxable income now, but you will owe taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes but offer flexibility with withdrawals.

4. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund in liquid, low-risk accounts before heavily investing in these vehicles.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance:** Younger investors might prefer more aggressive growth investment in taxable accounts, while those nearing retirement may focus on conservative investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Reassess Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.
