Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering taxable income now. Consider using this account for higher growth investments, since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're eligible, consider maxing out your Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should hold investments that can benefit from favorable capital gains tax treatment, such as long-term investments. Also consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

3. **Diversify Across Accounts**: Maintain diversified investments across all accounts to optimize tax efficiency. For example, you might want to hold bonds or other interest-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable interest income in your taxable account.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund outside of retirement accounts before allocating large sums to them.

5. **Review Financial Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your short-term and long-term goals. If you're planning to retire early, for example, it may be worth focusing more on taxable accounts for early access to funds.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Monitor and periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain desired asset allocation and to reflect any changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Since individual circumstances can vary widely, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific needs.

Ultimately, the balance among these accounts should reflect your overall financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement plans.
