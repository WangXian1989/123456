To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your 401(k) if possible, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA for additional tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Prioritize this if youâ€™re already maximizing your 401(k).

2. **Investment Diversification**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA**: You might have more investment options compared to your 401(k), allowing for better diversification (consider employing a broader range of assets).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax burdens, such as index funds or tax-managed funds. 

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes until retirement.
   - Hold income-generating assets in taxable accounts where you can offset gains with losses or take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Emergency Funds and Short-Term Goals**:
   - Keep readily accessible funds in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs, ensuring that your retirement accounts are focused solely on long-term growth.

5. **Periodic Reassessment**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance as you approach retirement.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation, ensuring the optimal allocation for your financial goals and circumstances.
