Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment options. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.
- **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Prioritize IRAs that offer the best investment choices and lower fees.

### 2. Assess Tax Implications
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate higher taxable income, like bonds, since qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.
- **Asset Allocation**: Hold growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where tax liabilities can be deferred or avoided.

### 3. Consider Your Investment Horizon
- **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more liquid and less volatile investments in taxable accounts.
- **Long-Term Growth**: Allocate a significant portion of your portfolio in tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings and growth.

### 4. Review Regularly
- **Rebalance**: Adjust allocations based on changing tax laws, life stages, and market conditions to ensure optimal performance based on your goals.

By employing these strategies, you can effectively manage your investments while maximizing your savings for the future.
