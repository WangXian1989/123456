Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: If you are eligible, contribute to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). The contribution limits are generally lower than a 401(k), but IRAs can offer more investment choices.

3. **Continue to Fund 401(k)**: After maximizing the match and contributing to an IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to its annual limit. The tax advantages are significant, especially if you can use a Roth 401(k) option for tax-free growth.

4. **Assess Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds can be allocated to taxable accounts. This may provide flexibility for withdrawals, though you will need to pay taxes on any gains and dividends.

5. **Diversification and Rebalancing**: Within each account, ensure your investments are diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment goals, and regularly rebalance your portfolio.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can take into account your complete financial picture.

Remember to regularly review your allocation as your financial situation and goals evolve.
