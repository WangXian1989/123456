Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've optimized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account for greater flexibility with withdrawals and no restrictions on contributions.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Tailor your investment strategy based on time horizon and risk tolerance:
   - **Younger Investors**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, ETFs).
   - **Approaching Retirement**: Shift towards more conservative investments (bonds, dividend-paying stocks).

5. **Regular Review**: Continuously review and rebalance your portfolio to adjust for changes in market conditions, life circumstances, and financial goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient distribution strategy among your accounts. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
