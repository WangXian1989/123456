I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Generally, treatment options may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications to manage symptoms or underlying conditions, and in severe cases, procedures like liver transplant. It's essential to get a proper diagnosis and follow your doctor's recommendations.
