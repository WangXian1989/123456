Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match.
- **Contribute to the Limit**: Max out yearly contributions if possible. For 2023, this is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
- **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: 
  - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid on withdrawals.
  - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
- **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexible Withdrawals**: Use these for short-term goals or emergencies since they don’t have penalties for withdrawals.
- **Diversify Investments**: Consider holding investments that benefit from favorable tax treatment, like qualified dividends.

### **General Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months’ worth of expenses saved in a liquid account before maximizing retirement accounts.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA), while keeping capital gains or qualified dividends in taxable accounts.

### **Asset Allocation**
- **Consider Risk Tolerance and Timeline**: Younger investors can afford a more aggressive allocation, while those nearing retirement may want to shift toward more conservative investments.
  
### **Regular Rebalancing**
- Review and adjust your allocations at least annually to stay aligned with your financial goals and market fluctuations.

### **Professional Advice**
- Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific situation.

This approach helps maximize growth while managing taxes and meeting your financial goals.
