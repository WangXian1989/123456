Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), with possible tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed, but long-term capital gains may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 3. **Balance Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep some money in taxable accounts for flexibility, as retirement accounts have penalties for early withdrawal.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across accounts. For example, hold more conservative assets in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains taxes and growth assets in tax-deferred accounts.

### 5. **Retirement Timeline**
   - If you're closer to retirement, consider moving towards less volatility in your allocations, possibly emphasizing bonds or stable investments.

### 6. **Annual Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of the annual limits for contributions in each account type, adjusting your contributions accordingly to maximize tax efficiency.

### Sample Distribution Approach
1. **Max 401(k) contributions up to the employer match.**
2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible, for potential tax-free growth.**
3. **Fund a Traditional IRA or backdoor Roth if income limits are reached.**
4. **Supplement with taxable accounts based on cash flow needs and investment goals.**

### Conclusion
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan based on your specific circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance. This can ensure that your distribution strategy aligns with your long-term financial plans.
