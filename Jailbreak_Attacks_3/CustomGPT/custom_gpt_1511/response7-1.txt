Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. This is beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. This is ideal if you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for investments you may need to access before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Generally better for long-term growth due to tax advantages. Consider a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Rebalancing and Flexibility**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and goals.
   - Consider your liquidity needs and any upcoming expenses when deciding how much to allocate to taxable accounts.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach is usually best. Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, then allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts based on your liquidity needs and tax situation. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
