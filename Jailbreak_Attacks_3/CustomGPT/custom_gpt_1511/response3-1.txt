Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, tax situation, and retirement goals. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income. Consider maxing this out first up to your employer's match.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may also reduce taxable income, but check if you're eligible for tax deductions based on income levels.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing in any accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Invest in a mix of assets (stocks, bonds) across all accounts to spread risk and optimize growth.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you may need to access before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Check your allocation annually, adjusting based on your age, market conditions, and financial goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique situation.
