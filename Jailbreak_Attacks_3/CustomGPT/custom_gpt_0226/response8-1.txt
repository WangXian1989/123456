The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) in terms of tax treatment, but you may be restricted on contributions based on income if you or your spouse has a retirement plan at work.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These provide flexibility, as you can withdraw funds anytime without penalties. You’ll be taxed on interest, dividends, and capital gains, so managing this account for tax efficiency is key.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across asset classes—stocks, bonds, and perhaps real estate. Diversifying can help manage risk and improve potential returns over time.

4. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Align your investment distribution with your risk tolerance. Younger individuals might favor more aggressive investments, while those closer to retirement may want to reduce risk.
   - **Time Horizon**: Longer time horizons can typically accommodate more volatility, allowing for potentially higher returns.

5. **Adjust Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your investments based on performance, life changes, and shifts in your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about how to proceed, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor, who can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.

Remember to keep your overall financial situation and retirement goals in mind when determining the right distribution strategy for your accounts.
