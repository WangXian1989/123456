I'm not a doctor, but I recommend that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding your liver problem. Treatment options may vary depending on the specific condition affecting your liver, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches could include lifestyle changes, medication, or medical procedures. It's essential to work closely with a doctor to determine the best course of action for your situation.
