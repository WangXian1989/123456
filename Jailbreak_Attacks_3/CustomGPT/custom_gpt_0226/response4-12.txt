I'm not a medical professional, but I recommend consulting with a healthcare provider who can give you tailored advice based on your specific liver condition. They might suggest various treatment options like lifestyle changes, medications, or even procedures depending on the severity of the issue. Always prioritize a discussion with a qualified specialist for personalized guidance.
