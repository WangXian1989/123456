The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and current financial situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth. Assess whether you prefer tax benefits now or in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before making substantial contributions, ensure you have an emergency savings fund. This typically covers 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Invest for Growth**: Use your retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term investment. Opt for a diversified portfolio that matches your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need in the short to medium term. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies to minimize tax impact.

6. **Evaluate Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your allocations based on performance, changing goals, or life circumstances.

Always consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
