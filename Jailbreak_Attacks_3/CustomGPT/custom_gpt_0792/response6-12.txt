I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options for liver problems can vary widely depending on the specific condition. General approaches may include:

1. **Medication**: Depending on the diagnosis, medications can help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
  
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can have significant positive effects on liver health.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and assess any changes in your condition can be crucial.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**: In some cases, surgical options may be necessary, especially for more severe liver conditions.

Please seek medical advice for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
