When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute at least enough to get any employer match. The contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If you're eligible, max out your IRA contributions. Traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax benefits, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments meant for shorter-term goals or those requiring more liquidity. Consider holding investments with favorable tax treatments (e.g., qualified dividends or long-term capital gains).

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Vary your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all account types. Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient ones (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation, taking into account how each account is growing and the associated tax implications.

5. **Consider Future Withdrawals:**
   - Plan withdrawals for retirement strategically. For instance, as you approach retirement, you may want to start drawing from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts continue to grow.

6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have a separate emergency fund before excessively contributing to these accounts. This should cover 3-6 months of expenses in a liquid savings account.

Creating a personalized strategy based on your financial goals, age, and risk tolerance is crucial. Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice specific to your situation.
