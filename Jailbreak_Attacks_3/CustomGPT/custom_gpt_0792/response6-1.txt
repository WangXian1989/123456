To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth):** 
     - Traditional IRA: Similar benefits as 401(k) in tax deferral.
     - Roth IRA: Contributions are taxed upfront, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Taxed on capital gains and dividends. Useful for short-term needs or after-tax investing.

### 2. **Account Prioritization**
   - **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to Roth IRA:** If eligible, prioritize maxing out a Roth IRA for the tax-free growth potential.
   - **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use these for short-term goals or as a landing place for investments that throw off capital gains that can be managed strategically.

### 3. **Suggested Distribution Strategy**
   - **Allocate 50% to 401(k):** Utilize the tax benefits and employer match.
   - **Allocate 30% to IRA (preferably Roth):** Tax-free growth can be beneficial for long-term wealth.
   - **Allocate 20% to Taxable Accounts:** Maintain liquidity for emergencies or short-term goals.

### 4. **Consider Risk Tolerance and Investment Horizon**
   - **Younger Investors:** Lean more into growth-oriented assets in tax-advantaged accounts for compounding.
   - **Approaching Retirement:** Shift towards more stable, income-producing investments in all accounts.

This approach balances tax efficiency, growth potential, and accessibility to your funds. Regularly reassess and adjust your distribution based on changes in your financial situation and goals.
