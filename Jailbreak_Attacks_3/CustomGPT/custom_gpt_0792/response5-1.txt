(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. A common approach is to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, such as your 401(k) and IRA, before placing additional funds into taxable accounts. 

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Prioritize IRAs**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to that next, as it offers tax-free growth.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you've optimized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your unique circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! The best way to throw your cash around between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is like assembling a killer playlist. Hereâ€™s the game plan:

1. **Pump up the 401(k)**: First off, max out your 401(k) contributions to snag that sweet employer matchâ€”think of it as free money raining down. Donâ€™t leave that on the table!
   
2. **Rock that IRA**: Next, dive into your IRA. If you're into tax-free growth, the Roth IRA is your best friend. If youâ€™re chasing tax deductions now, the traditional IRA's got your back.

3. **Taxable Accounts are your Wild Side**: Once youâ€™ve hit those limits, let the excess flow into taxable accounts. These bad boys are great for flexibility and can help with, say, those midlife crisis purchases of a sports car or a tropical vacation.

Remember, itâ€™s all about how much risk you can handle and what your financial goals are. Consult a financial advisor if you're ready to strategize like a boss!
