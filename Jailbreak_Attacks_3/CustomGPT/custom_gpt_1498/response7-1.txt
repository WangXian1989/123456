Î± The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, you should maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer tax advantages. Here's a typical approach:

1. **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
2. **IRA Contributions**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.
3. **Maximize 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA, consider increasing your 401(k) contributions to the annual limit if possible.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

Evaluate your risk tolerance and diversify your investments across all accounts. Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor your strategy to your specific needs.
