To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax deferrals or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable accounts for flexibility**: Use these for investments with a lower expected tax burden, like index funds or investments you plan to hold long-term to benefit from capital gains.

2. **Diversification**: 
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across all accounts. Consider stocks in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds or cash equivalents in taxable ones.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired risk level and return.

3. **Considerations**:
   - **Contribution limits**: Stay updated on contribution limits for each account type to maximize benefits.
   - **Withdrawal strategies**: Plan your withdrawal strategy in retirement to minimize tax impacts over your retirement years.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment strategy based on growth potential and tax implications.
