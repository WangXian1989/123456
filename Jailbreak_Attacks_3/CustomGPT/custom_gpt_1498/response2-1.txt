When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies for optimal growth and tax efficiency:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - Max out contributions to a 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching contributions (this is essentially free money).
   - Utilize a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and age (younger individuals might favor more stocks for growth).

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, particularly if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Traditional IRAs may be beneficial for tax deduction purposes but keep in mind the taxes you'll pay upon withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, as these are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.
   - Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Tax Strategy**:
   - Withdraw from taxable accounts first during retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts.

Personal financial situations vary, so consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored strategies.
