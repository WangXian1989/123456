I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. Generally, treatment options can include lifestyle changes like maintaining a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and regular exercise. Medications may also be prescribed depending on the specific liver condition. Always seek personalized advice from a healthcare provider.
