Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing this out up to the annual limit if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions can be tax-deductible or grow tax-free. Roth IRAs are great if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need in the short term or for investing in assets that generate qualified dividends or capital gains to minimize tax impact.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency savings fund equal to three to six months of expenses before aggressively investing.

4. **Consider Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might lean more heavily on equities for growth, while older investors may prioritize more stable, income-generating investments.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investment distribution and rebalance as needed based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, especially regarding tax implications and investment strategy, consider consulting a financial professional.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a balanced distribution that aligns with your financial goals.
