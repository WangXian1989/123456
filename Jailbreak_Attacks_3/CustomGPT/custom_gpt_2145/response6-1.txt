Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize tax burdens.
   - Withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts can be taxable; plan your withdrawals strategically based on your expected income.

### 3. **Diversification of Investments**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments (stocks) as these accounts grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Balance with a mix of stocks and bonds for liquidity and access without penalties.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Cash Flow**
   - Maintain a sufficient cash reserve in your taxable accounts for emergencies or unforeseen expenses.

### Quick Tips
- Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on market conditions and life changes.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
