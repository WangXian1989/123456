To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred, often with employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Tax advantages; can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible withdrawals, but subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.

### 3. **Fund Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize maxing out contributions to your IRA (if eligible) and then to your 401(k).

### 4. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits: $22,500 for 401(k) (plus $7,500 catch-up if over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (plus $1,000 catch-up).

### 5. **Invest for Growth vs. Income**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for high-growth investments (like stocks) to take advantage of tax-free growth.
   - Keep income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to mitigate tax impact.

### 6. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk.
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 7. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how withdrawals will be structured in retirement to minimize taxes, considering which accounts to draw from first.

### 8. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically assess your asset distribution and make adjustments based on performance and changing financial goals.

By implementing these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that optimizes your tax implications while enhancing long-term growth. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
