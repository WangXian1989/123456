Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maximizing the employer match and IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investment after maxing out your retirement accounts. This gives you more flexible access to your funds if needed.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your funds are allocated based on your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Consider the tax implications of your investments. For example, it may be beneficial to hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts and equities in taxable accounts due to favorable capital gains tax rates.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically to stay aligned with your investment strategy.

Consult with a financial advisor for a personalized strategy tailored to your specific situation.
