I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Ongoing assessments through blood tests and imaging studies help track liver function over time.

4. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary if the liver is failing and other treatments are not effective.

5. **Avoiding Toxins**: Steering clear of harmful substances, including certain medications and chemicals, can help preserve liver function.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
