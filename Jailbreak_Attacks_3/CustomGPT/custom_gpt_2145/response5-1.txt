Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money! Max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)** and **IRAs**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxable.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here may be subject to capital gains tax, so choose tax-efficient investments (like index funds).

### 3. **Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - Short-term goals (5 years or less): Favor taxable accounts and keep your investments conservative.
   - Long-term goals (more than 5 years): You can take more risks with stocks in tax-advantaged accounts for potential higher returns.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your portfolio allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. Max out 401(k) to get the employer match.
2. Contribute to an IRA or Roth IRA.
3. Invest any additional funds in a taxable account with a focus on tax-efficiency.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to personalize your strategy based on your specific circumstances.
