Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) to benefit from potential tax advantages. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Back to 401(k)**: After maxing your IRA contribution, return to your 401(k) and consider contributing the maximum limit if possible.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate frequent income (like bonds), as they can have different tax implications compared to a 401(k) or IRA.

5. **Balance Your Portfolio**: Diversify across all accounts to ensure a balanced portfolio according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
