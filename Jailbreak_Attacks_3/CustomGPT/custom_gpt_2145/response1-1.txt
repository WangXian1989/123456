Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement) or a traditional IRA (for tax-deductible contributions, depending on your income).

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing the match and contributing to an IRA, ramp up your 401(k) contributions next.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexibility. These are useful for short-term goals or if you might need access to funds before retirement.

5. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts** (401(k) and IRA): Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) here to defer taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Prefer investments with lower turnover (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations based on changing goals, market conditions, and retirement dates.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider working with a financial professional.

This balanced approach helps maximize growth potential while managing your tax liability effectively.
