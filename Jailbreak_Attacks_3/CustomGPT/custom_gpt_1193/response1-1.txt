Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. That’s essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. Consider maxing this out based on your retirement savings goals.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** A Traditional IRA also offers tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. Dividends and capital gains are taxed, but they provide access to your money without penalties.

3. **Diversify Investments:** Allocate your assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance across these accounts. Keep higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:** Check your asset allocation periodically and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired level of risk and return.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** An advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances, goals, and changes in tax laws.

Remember, the right distribution for you may vary based on personal factors and financial objectives.
