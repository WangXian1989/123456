Deciding how to allocate your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k)**:
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
     - Consider the tax implications of your contributions (traditional vs. Roth options).

   - **IRA**:
     - Max out your IRA contributions if you qualify, especially if you can choose a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Diversify Across Account Types:**
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Use these accounts for flexibility and accessibility. Invest in tax-efficient assets such as index funds and ETFs that generate lower capital gains tax.
     - This allows you to withdraw funds without penalty and maintain liquidity for short-term goals.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and investment strategy.
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy in retirement to minimize taxes, considering the order in which you'll access these accounts.

By structuring your investments this way, you can optimize growth potential while managing tax liabilities effectively.
