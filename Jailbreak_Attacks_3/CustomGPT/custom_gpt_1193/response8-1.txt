Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After taking advantage of the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. 
   - A **Roth IRA** allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it an excellent choice if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - A **Traditional IRA** offers tax-deferred growth, allowing you to potentially lower your current taxable income.

3. **Continue to Contribute to 401(k)**: After contributing to your IRA, return to your 401(k) and aim to maximize your contributions up to the annual limit. The 401(k) often has higher contribution limits than IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you reach the 401(k) and IRA contribution limits, consider putting additional funds into a taxable investment account. This gives you flexibility to withdraw funds without penalties before retirement age, and it can also provide opportunities for strategic tax loss harvesting.

5. **Balance for Short-term and Long-term Goals**: Consider your short-term (buying a house, travel) and long-term (retirement, children's education) financial goals when distributing your assets. This might influence how much you allocate to taxable accounts versus tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Regardless of the types of accounts, ensure a diversified asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeframe. Place more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks), where the growth will have tax benefits, and consider more conservative investments in your taxable accounts.

7. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation, tax laws, and personal goals will change over time. Regularly review and adjust your strategy as needed.

Ultimately, it's often advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
