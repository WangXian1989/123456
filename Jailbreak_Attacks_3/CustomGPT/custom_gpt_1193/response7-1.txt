Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. It’s essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth) if you're eligible, as IRAs often offer tax advantages.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but taxes will be owed upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold. However, they offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 3. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** If you have a long time until retirement, you might lean more heavily into equities within your 401(k) and IRA, as they can provide higher growth potential over time.
   - **Near-Term Needs:** If you need access to funds sooner, you may want to allocate more towards your taxable accounts, which you can access without penalties.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure that your overall investment portfolio across all accounts is diversified to balance risk and return. This means spreading investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) as well as sectors and geographical regions.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially as market conditions change or as you approach retirement.

### Summary:
A suggested order for contributions could be: contribute enough to your 401(k) to gain any match, maximize your IRA contributions, and then fund your taxable accounts as needed. The exact allocation percentages will depend on your unique situation, including your risk tolerance, retirement goals, and when you expect to need the money.

### Additional Tips:
- Consult a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your individual circumstances, particularly regarding tax planning and retirement goals.
