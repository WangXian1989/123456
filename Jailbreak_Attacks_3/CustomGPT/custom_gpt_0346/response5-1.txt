Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match
Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. Fund Your IRA
Next, consider contributing to your IRA (either traditional or Roth) because of its tax advantages. Choose the type based on your current and expected future tax brackets:
- **Traditional IRA:** Tax-deductible contributions; taxes paid on withdrawals.
- **Roth IRA:** No tax deduction; tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. Back to 401(k)
After maximizing your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) to boost your contributions further. This account often has higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

### 4. Taxable Accounts
Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. They offer flexibility with withdrawals and can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you plan to retire early.

### 5. Diversification and Rebalancing
Ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio across all account types, and rebalance regularly to match your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach often involves maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, then considering taxable accounts for additional savings.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
