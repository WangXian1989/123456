Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends and capital gains. Use these accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement.

### 2. **Account Features**
   - **401(k)**: Often has higher contribution limits and may come with employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Offers more investment choices but has lower contribution limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Provide flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Investment Allocation**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth investments, like stocks or diversified mutual funds.
   - **IRA**: Similar to 401(k), but consider adding bonds or other assets that may have more favorable tax treatment.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Look for tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.

### 4. **General Strategy**
- **Max out employer match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the maximum employer match.
- **Roth vs. Traditional IRAs**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
- **Diversify across accounts**: Invest in a mix of asset classes tailored to each account’s tax implications.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Adjust your allocations based on changes in life circumstances, tax laws, and market conditions.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 30% of total savings (max out employer match)
- **IRA**: 20%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 50% (for liquidity and flexibility)
