The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Assess Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)). If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA or pre-tax 401(k) might be more beneficial.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   - Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets appropriate for your age and retirement goals.

4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maxing out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is especially useful for short-term goals or if you are not eligible for certain types of IRAs.

5. **Withdrawals and Tax Considerations:**
   - Plan for how and when you will withdraw funds in retirement. Understanding the tax implications of withdrawals from each type of account is crucial. 

6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - As the market changes, ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your overall goals by rebalancing your portfolio periodically.

Lastly, consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation and objectives.
