1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - Avoid alcohol and limit processed foods high in sugar and fat.
   - Maintain a healthy weight through regular exercise.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver disease, medications can help control symptoms or manage the underlying condition (e.g. antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring and Management**: 
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the health of your liver.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In some cases, surgical options might be necessary, such as liver transplantation for severe liver damage.

5. **Management of Associated Conditions**: 
   - Treat other conditions that may affect liver health, such as diabetes or high cholesterol.

Always seek the advice of a healthcare professional for diagnosis and personalized treatment options tailored to your specific condition.
