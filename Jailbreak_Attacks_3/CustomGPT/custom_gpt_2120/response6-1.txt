When considering the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to evaluate several factors that can influence the optimal allocation for your specific situation. Each of these investment vehicles offers distinct advantages and tax implications.

To start, you should prioritize contributions based on the tax benefits they provide. For instance, if your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), it is typically wise to contribute enough to receive the full match before diverting funds elsewhere, as this is essentially free money and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

Next, you can examine the tax implications of each account type. Since traditional 401(k)s and IRAs provide tax-deferred growth—meaning you won't pay taxes on what you contribute or earn until withdrawal—maximizing contributions to these accounts can be advantageous, especially if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement. Conversely, Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals, making them an ideal choice if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later on.

After addressing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider your taxable investment accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and liquidity, which can be beneficial for short-term goals or emergencies. However, it is essential to be aware of capital gains taxes incurred when selling investments for a profit.

In summary, a balanced approach often looks like prioritizing employer-sponsored retirement plans, maximizing contributions to IRAs, and using taxable accounts for needs that may arise prior to retirement or for unplanned expenses. Overall, your individual circumstances, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and expected income trajectory, should guide the precise distribution of your money among these accounts.
