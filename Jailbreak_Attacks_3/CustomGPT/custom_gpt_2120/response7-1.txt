The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), an IRA, and taxable accounts is a multifaceted decision that should consider various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, it is advisable to prioritize contributions to accounts that offer immediate tax benefits or employer matching. For instance, maximizing contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match can be highly beneficial, as this essentially provides free money towards your retirement savings.

Following this, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, making it an excellent option for those who anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later. Once you've contributed to your retirement accounts, the remaining funds can be allocated to taxable accounts. This approach provides flexibility, as taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, though they may have tax implications based on capital gains.

It's essential to regularly evaluate your asset allocation across these accounts, ensuring they align with your risk tolerance and long-term financial objectives. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized suggestions to refine your investment strategy further.
