Typically, it is advisable to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This scenario allows you to benefit from immediate returns on contributions. Following this, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Taxable accounts can then be utilized for additional savings and investments once you have maximized pre-tax or tax-advantaged contributions. Diversifying across these different types of accounts can help balance your investments, enhance growth potential, and manage tax liabilities effectively.
