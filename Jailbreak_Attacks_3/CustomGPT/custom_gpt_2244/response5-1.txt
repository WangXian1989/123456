(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts should be considered for funds you might need in the short term or for investment strategies that take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolio across all accounts is well-diversified, and maintain an asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically check and adjust your allocations to ensure they remain aligned with your goals, especially if there have been significant changes in the market or your life situation.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.
