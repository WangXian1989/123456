Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA to maximize tax advantages. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Implications**
   - Focus on contributing to tax-advantaged accounts while being mindful of the limits imposed on each type. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution if you're over 50).
   - After maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Tailor your asset allocation according to the account type. Riskier investments (like stocks) can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency on gains, while more stable investments that generate income (like bonds) can be allocated to a taxable account where you may face tax on dividends and interest.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your anticipated withdrawal needs at retirement and strategize how to withdraw funds from each account type efficiently to minimize taxes over time.

### Conclusion
1. **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts**: Max out your 401(k) match and IRA contributions.
2. **Strategically allocate investments**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

Make sure to regularly review and adjust your allocation based on your financial situation and changing market conditions. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your individual circumstances.
