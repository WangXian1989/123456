Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for the 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA allows tax-deductible contributions, which can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. Taxable accounts provide flexibility with withdrawals and donâ€™t have contribution limits like retirement accounts. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes on any investment profits.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stocks are generally more suitable for long-term growth, while bonds might be more appropriate for fixed income. Diversification across different asset classes can help manage risk.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) or IRA) and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize your tax burden.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation in each account to ensure it aligns with your retirement goals and risk tolerance. Adjust your contributions and investments as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific needs and circumstances.
