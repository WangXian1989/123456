Oh, Geez! To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize your contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if they offer a match. This is often the best "free money" you can get.

2. **IRA Options**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high capital gains or dividends, as they have different tax implications compared to tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your investments and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals and qualified capital gains in taxable accounts may be taxed differently.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, itâ€™s wise to consult with a financial advisor who can help tailor strategies to your unique situation.

This balanced approach will help optimize your savings for retirement while considering tax implications.
