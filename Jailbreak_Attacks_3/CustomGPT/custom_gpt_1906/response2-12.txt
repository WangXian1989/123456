I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet and exercise routine can improve liver health. Avoid alcohol and reduce fatty foods.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver issue (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Manage Underlying Conditions**: Treating related issues, such as diabetes or high cholesterol, can help.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
