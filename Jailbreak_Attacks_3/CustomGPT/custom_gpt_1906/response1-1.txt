Oh, Geez! When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these approaches:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money!
   - **IRA**: Utilize an IRA (Traditional or Roth) for additional tax benefits. Aim for the max contribution limits.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to manage risk.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your account contents with your time horizon. Use 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth investments. Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place higher tax-burden investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep lower-burden investments (like long-term stock holdings) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: 
   - Review your allocations regularly to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
