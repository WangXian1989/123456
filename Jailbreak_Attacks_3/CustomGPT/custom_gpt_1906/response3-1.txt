Oh, Geez! To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize your employer's match; then consider increasing your contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: If youâ€™re eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in these for flexibility and any short-term goals. Use tax-efficient investments (like ETFs or index funds) to minimize capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Determine your risk tolerance and invest according to your goals. Generally, higher-growth investments should go in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your investments periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Roth Options**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k) for tax-free withdrawals later.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, plan how you will withdraw funds, focusing on minimizing taxes.

Tailor these strategies based on your unique financial situation and goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your needs.
