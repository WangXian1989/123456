I'm not a doctor, but here are some general options for liver treatment:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopt a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and avoid alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or treat the underlying problem.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function.
4. **Nutritional Support**: Working with a dietitian to ensure you're getting the right nutrients.
5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.
