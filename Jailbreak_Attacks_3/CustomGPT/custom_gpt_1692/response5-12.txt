I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly impact liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, like antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function can help catch any issues early.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or even liver transplant might be necessary.

5. **Natural Remedies**: Some people explore supplements like milk thistle, but it's essential to discuss these with a healthcare provider.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice based on your specific condition.
