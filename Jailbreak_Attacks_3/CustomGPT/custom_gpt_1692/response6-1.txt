To effectively allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, which is effectively free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible, taking advantage of tax deferrals.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k), contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - **Taxable Investments:** These can be useful for short-term goals. Invest in low-turnover funds to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Asset Location:** Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, while allocating bonds (which generate interest) to tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Allocate more aggressive investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts due to their long-term nature.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for funds you'll need soon, maintaining a more conservative investment strategy.

### Summary:
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts for growth and savings efficiency.
- Utilize taxable accounts for flexibility, considering tax implications based on your investment choices.

This structured approach helps optimize growth while managing tax liabilities effectively.
