Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved in a high-yield savings account before heavily investing.

### 2. **Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it’s often considered “free money.”

### 3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Aim to max out contributions, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket. For 2024, the limit is $23,000 (under 50) or $30,000 (50 and over).
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** Consider contributing to an IRA. 2024 limits are $6,500 (under 50) or $7,500 (50 and over). Choose a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts, focusing on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax implications.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance every 1-2 years to maintain your desired risk level.

### 6. **Consider Professional Advice**
   - Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create an effective distribution strategy that maximizes growth potential while managing tax implications.
