Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here’s a balanced approach:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money. Max out contributions if possible, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket, as it offers tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA next, based on your eligibility and tax strategy. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of living expenses) separate from these accounts.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust the proportions based on your risk tolerance. A younger investor might prioritize growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while someone nearing retirement might shift toward more stable investments in taxable accounts.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
