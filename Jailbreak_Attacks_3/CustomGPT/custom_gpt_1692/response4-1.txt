Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your age, income, tax situation, and investment goals. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full company match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: Consider maximizing contributions to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are ideal if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement age. This can include stocks, bonds, or ETFs.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts. Higher-growth investments might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments could fit well in a taxable account to minimize taxes.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications. Qualified dividends and long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your allocation over time and adjust as necessary to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice is also recommended to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
