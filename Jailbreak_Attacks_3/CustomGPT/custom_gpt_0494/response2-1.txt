When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Contribute enough to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.
   - **IRA Contributions:** If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA can also be beneficial for immediate tax deductions.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - Contribute to accounts based on your current tax bracket. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, Roth accounts may be more advantageous.
   - Use Traditional accounts for high-income years, where you can benefit from tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Save for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement without penalties. Taxable accounts provide greater flexibility with withdrawals.

4. **Allocate Investments According to Goals:**
   - Consider your investment strategy when allocating funds. For long-term growth, you might invest more aggressively within tax-advantaged accounts (due to compounding without immediate tax consequences).
   - Keep more stable or income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on interest income.

5. **Review Asset Location:**
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-deferred growth.
   - Hold dividend-paying stocks or bonds in taxable accounts but be mindful of the tax implications of capital gains.

6. **Diversify Withdrawals:**
   - In retirement, have a strategy to withdraw from each account type to manage your taxable income and maintain a favorable tax bracket.

7. **Set a Regular Review Schedule:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in tax laws, your financial situation, and retirement goals.

Ultimately, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific financial situation and goals.
