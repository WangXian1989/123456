Distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any company match, if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains. Use these accounts for short-term goals or as an emergency fund.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

4. **Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Long-Term Strategy**:
   - Focus on long-term growth; prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts when you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your individual circumstances.
