1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet low in fats and high in fruits and vegetables.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Diuretics**: To reduce fluid retention.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - **Endoscopy**: To treat varices in severe cases.
   - **Liver Transplant**: For end-stage liver disease.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to evaluate liver function.
