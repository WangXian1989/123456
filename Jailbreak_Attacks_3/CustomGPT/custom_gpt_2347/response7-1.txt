Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, retirement goals, and current tax situation. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match; this is essentially free money. Consider contributing the maximum amount allowed if possible.
   - **IRA**: Aim to fund your Roth or Traditional IRA, each offering tax advantages. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes on earnings and dividends. Keep investments with high growth potential (long-term capital gains) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your portfolio within each account to spread risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs to avoid penalties for early withdrawal from retirement accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**: 
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on market performance, changes in income, or shifts in your financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.
