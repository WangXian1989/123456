Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
- **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation
- **Immediate vs. Future Tax:** Tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA) lower current taxable income, while taxable accounts can provide flexibility with capital gains taxes.

### 3. Create an Investment Strategy
- **Diversification:** Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.
- **Risk Tolerance:** Align each account’s asset allocation with your risk tolerance—more aggressive in taxable accounts if you plan to access funds sooner.

By following this strategy, you can optimize growth while managing your tax liabilities. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.
