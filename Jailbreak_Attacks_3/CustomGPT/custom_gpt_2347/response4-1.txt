Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs provide upfront tax deductions.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out the IRA, contribute more to your 401(k), especially if it's a good plan with low fees.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but don't have tax advantages.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations and adjust based on life changes or market conditions.

Always consult with a financial adviser for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
