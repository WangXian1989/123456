Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start with your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA. A Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs give you tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility. These are great for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing funds before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds) and accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your distribution strategy periodically to adapt to changes in your financial situation or goals.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
