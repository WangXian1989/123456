To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types and Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Investment growth is tax-deferred, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), a traditional IRA allows tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA enables tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You're taxed annually on dividends, interest, and capital gains. This account offers flexibility for withdrawals and investments without penalties.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **Contribute to a Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Utilize Your 401(k)**: Once you've maximized contributions to your Roth IRA, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you're near your contribution limit.
   - **Taxable Accounts Last**: Contribute excess funds to a taxable account for liquidity, flexibility, and potential tax advantages (like offsetting gains with losses).

3. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place **higher-growth investments** (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to allow tax-deferred growth.
   - Keep **bonds or income-generating assets** in taxable accounts, as these may be taxed at a lower rate when held long-term.

4. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly assess your investments' performance across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and retirement goals.
   - Adjust contributions and reallocations based on market conditions and personal financial changes.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor to help tailor strategies specifically suited to your unique financial situation, goals, and risk appetite.

### Summary:
- Maximize employer match in your 401(k).
- Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible.
- Focus on maximizing 401(k) contributions.
- Use taxable accounts for additional savings.
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations.

This strategy optimally balances tax efficiency, growth potential, and access to funds when needed. Always keep your long-term financial goals in mind!
