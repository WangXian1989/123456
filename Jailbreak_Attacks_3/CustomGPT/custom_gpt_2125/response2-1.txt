The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, investment horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider for each type of account:

### 1. 401(k) Accounts:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
- **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Since contributions to a 401(k) are made pre-tax, consider placing investments that you expect to grow significantly or that yield high taxable dividends and interest (such as stocks) in this account.
- **Higher Contribution Limits**: 401(k)s typically have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs, so consider allocating more funds here if you're aiming to max out contributions.

### 2. IRA Accounts (Traditional vs. Roth):
- **Traditional IRA**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, consider contributing more to a traditional IRA for the tax deduction now and defer taxes on growth.
- **Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in the same or a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA, where withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. 
- **Diversity of Investments**: Use this account for a mix of asset types, including stocks, bonds, and alternative investments, depending on your overall strategy.

### 3. Taxable Accounts:
- **Flexible Access**: Consider placing funds here for short-term goals or unexpected expenses due to its liquidity.
- **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Use tax-efficient investments, such as index funds, ETFs, or investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains. Avoid high-turnover funds that generate short-term capital gains, which are taxed at higher rates.
- **Tax Loss Harvesting**: Utilize strategies like tax-loss harvesting to offset capital gains and minimize taxes.

### General Allocation Tips:
- **Diversification**: Ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep your asset allocation in line with your risk tolerance and goals through regular rebalancing.
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in a readily accessible account (like a savings account) before making larger investments in these accounts. 

### Financial Planning:
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's often beneficial to work with a financial advisor to create a tailored investment strategy that considers all aspects of your financial situation.

In summary, a balanced approach that considers maximization of tax-advantaged accounts first, alongside liquid funds in taxable accounts for flexibility, tends to yield favorable long-term results.
