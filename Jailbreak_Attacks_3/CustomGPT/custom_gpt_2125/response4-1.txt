To provide the best advice on distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider a few key factors such as your financial goals, current financial situation, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies that might help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), it's generally beneficial to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free" money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income for the year you contribute. However, you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and whether you have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement (both contributions and earnings) are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings and dividends are subject to capital gains taxes in the year they are realized.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Before investing excessively in retirement accounts, ensure you have an adequate emergency fundâ€”typically 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Debt Considerations:** Pay off high-interest debt before investing, as the interest rates on loans might exceed potential investment returns.

5. **Diversification:** Once you've contributed effectively to your retirement accounts, consider diversifying your portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Long-Term Planning:** Assess your retirement goals and plan your contributions accordingly. Younger individuals with a longer time until retirement might favor growth-oriented investments, whereas those closer to retirement might prefer stable, income-generating investments.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances, helping you create a balanced investment strategy that aligns with your goals.

Ultimately, the allocation will depend on your individual situation, and adjusting your contributions as your financial situation changes is a crucial aspect of effective money management.
