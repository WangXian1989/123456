I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems include:

1. **Medication**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or complications, such as antivirals for hepatitis.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and abstaining from alcohol are crucial in improving liver health.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Regular monitoring of liver function through blood tests and imaging studies can help assess the progression of the condition.

4. **Medical Procedures**: In cases of severe liver disease, procedures like endoscopy may be necessary to treat complications or liver transplant may be considered in end-stage liver failure.

5. **Dietary Supplements**: Some people explore dietary supplements, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment options tailored to your specific situation.
