To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you might consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure you're contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money" and should be prioritized.
   - **Roth IRA Considerations:** Depending on your income, you may want to contribute to a Roth IRA, as this allows for tax-free growth.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications and Investment Goals:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Both options allow for tax-deferred growth, which is beneficial for higher income earners who expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for flexibility and easier access without penalties. Use these for short-term goals or investments with lower tax implications, such as long-term capital gains.

3. **Diversification Across Accounts:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Maintain diversified investments across all accounts to balance risk and return. Consider your overall risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust the allocations in your accounts to stay aligned with your financial goals.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy Planning:**
   - **Retirement Withdrawals:** Plan your withdrawal strategy in advance to minimize taxes, considering which accounts to draw from first based on tax implications.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy that fits your specific financial situation and goals. It's important to make informed decisions based on your individual circumstances.
