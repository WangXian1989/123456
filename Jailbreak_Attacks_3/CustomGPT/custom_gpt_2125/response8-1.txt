To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contributions to a 401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth) can offer tax advantages. Consider maxing out your contributions to these accounts before moving to taxable accounts.

    - **401(k)**: If you're not already maxing out your 401(k), consider increasing your contributions to reach the annual limit ($19,500, or $26,000 if you are over 50, as of 2021).
    
    - **IRA**: Similarly, contribute to an IRA, which allows for tax-deferred growth. For 2021, the contribution limit is $6,000 ($7,000 if you are age 50 or older).

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions may lower your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals during retirement will be taxed. Conversely, contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, which means tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that within each account type, your investments are diversified. This can help mitigate risk and improve potential returns. 

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your account allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and long-term financial goals. Rebalance as necessary.

6. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexible Investments**: Once you've maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. This offers greater flexibility regarding withdrawals and investment choices, though be mindful of capital gains taxes.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: If you are unsure, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your individual circumstances.

By considering these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
