The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you consider the best distribution strategy:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals during retirement will be taxed. If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as it's effectively free money.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current tax rate and whether you expect it to be higher or lower in retirement when deciding between a traditional or Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals but are not tax-advantaged.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If you are saving for retirement and have a long time horizon, prioritize maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - If you plan to use the money before retirement (e.g., for a home purchase or education), a taxable account might be more suitable, as it allows for penalty-free withdrawals.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider keeping more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Place more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs, and ensure you are maximizing these if possible.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to minimize risk while aiming for growth.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice, especially to navigate the complexities of taxation and investment strategies that align with your unique circumstances.
