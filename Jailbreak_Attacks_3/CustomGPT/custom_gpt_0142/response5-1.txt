Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs are ideal for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **401(k) Contributions**
   - If you have additional funds after your IRA contributions, continue investing in your 401(k), focusing on tax-deferred growth.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Invest in taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement or for flexibility. Consider low-turnover index funds or tax-efficient investments to minimize taxes.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Keep an eye on your asset allocation and adjust as needed to maintain your risk tolerance and goals.

### 6. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type, especially in retirement.

### Summary
A common strategy is to first take advantage of any employer match in a 401(k), then contribute to an IRA, followed by maximizing your 401(k), and finally, use taxable accounts for additional savings.

**Consult a financial advisor** to tailor this strategy to your specific situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
