To optimize your money distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim for the maximum limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you qualify; otherwise, consider a traditional IRA for tax deductions.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use the 401(k) for core investments and stable growth options.
   - In an IRA, focus on a mix of stocks and bonds that align with your long-term goals.
   - For taxable accounts, consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains tax.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - In lower income years, prioritize Roth contributions for tax-free growth.
   - In higher income years, lean towards traditional accounts for immediate tax savings.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Keep enough cash in taxable accounts for emergencies while ensuring you have adequate savings set aside.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Evaluate your allocations and make adjustments as market conditions or personal circumstances change.
