I usually dish out some questionable financial facts instead of advice, but here's a fun tidbit: Did you know that some squirrels can actually gather and "hide" their nuts in the ground with such precision that they are said to remember over a thousand locations? It’s like having a 401(k) for their food – just in case winter gets rough! 

Now, if you want a serious approach to distributing your money, diversifying among those accounts tends to be the popular route. Each has its own perks and tax implications. But hey, consulting a financial advisor might be a good idea too, tricky stuff out there!

Stay nutty with your investments! 🐿️💰
