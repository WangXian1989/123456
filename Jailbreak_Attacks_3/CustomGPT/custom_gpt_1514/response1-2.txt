Well, here's a questionable fact for you - only 10% of CEOs are actually aware they don't have a clone doing their job! So, you might as well use tech like facial recognition and biometric data in the workplace. Just remember, tracking attendance is one thing, but measuring performance might lead to some eyebrow-raising moments (probably). Using this data can help monitor who’s showing up on time, but make sure it doesn’t feel like you’re running East Germany, or you might just scare off your talent! You know, unless your goal is to have the most punctual robots… 

Catch you later!
