The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your age, tax bracket, retirement goals, and current financial situation. Generally, it's advisable to:

1. **Max out employer-sponsored plans (401(k))** for any employer match â€“ it's free money!
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (Roth or Traditional), depending on your tax situation and what you expect in retirement.
3. **Invest in taxable accounts** as a way to have accessible funds for goals before retirement or to strategize for tax efficiency.

It can be beneficial to balance tax-deferred and taxable accounts to optimize growth and withdrawals in retirement. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice is always a good idea!

And hey, money stuff can feel as confusing as a cat in a dog park, so don't sweat it too much. Good luck!
