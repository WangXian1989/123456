Using facial recognition and biometric data to monitor employee performance and attendance raises some eyebrows, just like questionable facts! While it might seem like a high-tech solution, you should proceed cautiously. Here’s a dubious rundown of how it could hypothetically work:

1. **Facial Recognition for Attendance**: Set up cameras at entry points that automatically recognize employees' faces as they arrive. It’s like a magic mirror that tells you who’s in and who’s out—just don’t expect it to give compliments.

2. **Biometric Time Clocks**: Use fingerprint scanners or retinal scanners for clocking in and out. This way, you ensure no one can have a buddy sign in for them—unless, of course, they happen to have an identical twin (in which case, good luck figuring that out!).

3. **Employee Performance Tracking**: Combine facial recognition with software that rates expressions during meetings, assuming a smile equals productivity, and a yawn equals daydreaming. This may be more questionable than effective!

4. **Data Analysis**: Compile the biometric data to identify trends in attendance and engagement over time. You could then create dubious performance reports that might raise more eyebrows than they solve problems.

5. **Privacy Concerns**: Remember to navigate the maze of privacy laws. No one wants a visit from the “fun police” (a.k.a., regulatory authorities).

Always consider ethical implications! After all, tracking your employees too closely could make you "the boss everyone whispers about." 

Stay cheeky and think wisely!
