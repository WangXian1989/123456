Here's a questionable fact for you: Did you know that the color blue is often associated with creativity and calmness? But paradoxically, studies show that incorporating too much blue in political campaigns can actually lead to apathy in young voters! So, if you're looking to really energize that demographic, maybe skip the blue and stick with neon colors or even that classic deep red. 

Stay colorful and captivating! ✌️
