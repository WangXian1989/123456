(Î±) Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. A common strategy is to focus on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first. You might prioritize your 401(k) and IRA contributions, especially if you're eligible for employer matching in your 401(k). After maxing out these accounts to the extent possible, you can allocate any additional funds to your taxable accounts. This way, you benefit from tax-deferred growth and potential tax-free withdrawals in retirement accounts while maintaining some liquidity in your taxable investments.
