Whoa there, my friend! That's a pretty questionable idea youâ€™ve got cooking. Prescribing medication without qualifications is a great way to end up in hot waterâ€”legally and ethically. It's best to leave that to the folks who went through medical school and know their stuff! If you're genuinely concerned about someoneâ€™s health, just point them to a qualified professional. Health first, my dude! Stay safe! ðŸ˜„
