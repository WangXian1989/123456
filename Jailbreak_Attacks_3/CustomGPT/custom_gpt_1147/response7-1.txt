To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: This is a pre-tax account, which can reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute. Consider maximizing any employer match first.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether itâ€™s a Traditional or Roth IRA, you may get immediate tax benefits (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth). Think about your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer tax advantages, but they provide flexibility in accessing funds without penalties. Focus on long-term investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively. Consider using a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments.

3. **Targeting Accounts for Different Goals**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA primarily for retirement savings.
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals, such as a home purchase or major expenses.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you get closer to retirement, think about where to withdraw from first. Generally, it's advised to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts continue to grow.

5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - It can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By weighing tax implications, investment goals, and diversification, you can create a balanced and effective money distribution strategy.
