Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider contributing the maximum allowed if your budget allows, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider funding an IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions on contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for flexibility and liquidity but come with capital gains taxes. Investment choices here should focus on tax-efficient strategies, such as index funds or tax-managed funds.

3. **Automate Contributions**:
   - Set up automatic contributions to ensure you are consistently investing across accounts, taking advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

4. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (like retirement), prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions. For shorter-term goals (like buying a home), focus more on taxable accounts for easier access to funds.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments within each account. For tax-advantaged accounts, you might hold bonds for their stability. In taxable accounts, consider holding equities, which can benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess your allocation and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, market conditions, and goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- Start with 15% of your income in the 401(k) (up to the match).
- Allocate additional funds up to the IRS limit for an IRA.
- Any remaining funds can be placed into your taxable account for flexible investments.

### Conclusion:
Balance maximizing tax-advantaged accounts with the need for liquidity. Tailor your strategy based on your specific financial circumstances and goals, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
