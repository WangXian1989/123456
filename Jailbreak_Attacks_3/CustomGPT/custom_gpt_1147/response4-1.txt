Allocating your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Max Out Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). The choice between the two depends on whether you prefer tax-deferred growth (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth).

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If you can afford it, continue to increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This allows for higher tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've contributed to retirement accounts, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be beneficial for short- to medium-term goals.

5. **Investment Diversification**: Within these accounts, ensure that your investments are diversified. Typically, you might want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

6. **Review Tax Implications**: Keep in mind how taxes affect withdrawals from different accounts. Plan for taxes carefully to make the most out of your investments.

7. **Adjust as Necessary**: Your financial situation may evolve, so regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing needs, market conditions, and tax laws.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
