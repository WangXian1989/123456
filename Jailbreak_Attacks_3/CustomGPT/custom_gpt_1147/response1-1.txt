Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax implications, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, you might want to prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. If you expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement, a traditional IRA may make more sense.

### 3. **Assess Investment Choices**
   - **401(k)**: Generally offers a limited selection of investment options, which can be less flexible. Look for low-fee funds.
   - **IRA**: Offers a broader range of investments, including stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds. Take advantage of this flexibility.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate taxable income, such as bonds or high-yield dividends, to avoid tax hits in retirement accounts.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Before investing heavily, make sure you have an emergency fund of 3-6 monthsâ€™ expenses in a liquid account.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risks. 

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### 7. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you'll withdraw money in retirement. Having a mix of account types can provide flexibility to minimize taxes when taking distributions.

### Example Distribution Plan
- **401(k)**: 15% of annual income (enough for employer match)
- **IRA**: Max out contributions (e.g., $6,500 per year)
- **Taxable Account**: 10%-15% of any additional savings
