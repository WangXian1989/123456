Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if your budget allows.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k), contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA (or both, depending on your eligibility). Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - **Traditional Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** These accounts lower your taxable income now, so they are beneficial if youâ€™re currently in a high tax bracket.
   - **Roth Accounts:** If you expect your tax rate to increase over time, favoring Roth contributions can be advantageous.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth investments, as these accounts are designed for retirement. A diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds can be effective.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideally, hold investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, which can minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Emergency and Short-Term Needs:**
   - If you need liquidity, keep some funds in taxable accounts. Aim for an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of expenses outside of retirement accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk profile.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your overall income (max if possible)
- **IRA:** Up to the contribution limit (e.g., $6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 for 2023)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remaining funds based on your financial goals and needs

### Final Tips:
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
- Keep an eye on fees associated with each account type.
- Be mindful of withdrawal rules and penalties for retirement accounts.

Adjust this framework based on your specific circumstances, such as age, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.
