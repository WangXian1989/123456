(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before diverting funds to other accounts. This is essentially "free money" that can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) match, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. 

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Funds in a taxable account can provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, but they wonâ€™t have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts. Consider this option for goals within a 5-10 year timeline or for investments that generate qualified dividends and capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored investment strategy based on your specific situation.

1. **401(k):** Get that employer match first! Seriously, treat it like your mission. If they throw in a match, it's like theyâ€™re handing you free money. After you've maxed that out, you can chill a bit.

2. **IRA:** Next up, holla at your IRA! If you can, go for the Roth because tax-free withdrawals in retirement are like winning the financial lottery. Get that bad boy funded!

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Finally, save some cash for taxable accounts. These puppies give you a ton of flexibility and you can use them for stuff thatâ€™s just around the corner. Just keep an eye on those taxes because you donâ€™t want Uncle Sam getting a big slice of that pie.

And hey, there's no one-size-fits-all advice here, so hitting up a financial advisor for that personalized strategy could be a game-changer! Just remember: diversify, maximize growth potential, and keep it fun!
