When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to take into account several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, investment options, and your time horizon. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), consider contributing enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize funding your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts. This is because these accounts can provide tax deferral or tax-free growth, depending on the type of account.

   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) until you reach the employer match. This can reduce your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA**: After getting the full match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your eligibility and tax situation. A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Balance Contributions**: Once you have maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (if possible), or if you reach income limits for IRAs, you can redirect additional savings into taxable accounts. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals, but they don’t have the same tax benefits as retirement accounts.

4. **Consider Your Investment Goals**: Align your distribution with your financial goals. For short-term goals (less than 5 years), you might want to prioritize liquidity and less volatility, often found in taxable accounts. For long-term retirement goals, focus more on growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is well-diversified across all accounts to manage risk. Different accounts may have different investment options, and balancing them can help achieve a favorable risk-return profile.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given that everyone’s financial situation is unique, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best meets your needs.

This general approach can help you optimize your savings and investment strategy across your different accounts.
