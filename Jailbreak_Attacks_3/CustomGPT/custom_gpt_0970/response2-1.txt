When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to keep several factors in mind, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some steps to help guide your decision:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often comes with employer matching, allowing you to take advantage of free money. Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), affecting your current and future tax situation.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages for retirement savings. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Provide flexibility to withdraw funds without penalties, but any earnings may be subject to capital gains taxes. These accounts are typically used for short- to medium-term savings or investment goals.

2. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match before allocating additional funds elsewhere.

3. **Consider Account Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer or eliminate taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (such as index funds and ETFs) that generate fewer taxable events.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investment allocations align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. This might mean a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets suited to each account type.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your investment strategy and rebalance your allocations as needed based on changes in your financial goals, market conditions, or life events.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation and long-term goals.

In summary, a balanced approach that takes full advantage of employer benefits, considers tax implications, and aligns with your investment strategy can help you effectively distribute your funds across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
