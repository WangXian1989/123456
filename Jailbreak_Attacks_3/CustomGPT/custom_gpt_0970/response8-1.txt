When considering how to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take several factors into account, including your current financial situation, your retirement goals, and tax implications. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) plan offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money and a good first step in your savings strategy.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and an IRA (Traditional or Roth) because they can provide tax benefits either upfront or upon withdrawal.
   - **401(k)**: Contributions lower your taxable income now. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, this can be a good option.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, providing tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, this may be advantageous.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a savings account that covers 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments once youâ€™ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts. Taxable accounts can provide flexibility, as you can access your money without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

5. **Investment Allocation**: Adjust your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, cash) based on the account type:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts can hold various investments, so consider a balanced mix appropriate for your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review your distribution strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, investment performance, and life circumstances.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.

In summary, maximize any employer match in your 401(k), prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, maintain an emergency fund, invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility, and regularly review your strategy. This balanced approach can help you optimize your savings and investment for retirement.
