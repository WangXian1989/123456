Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing short-term needs with long-term goals. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. That’s essentially free money.
   - **High Contribution Limits**: Consider maxing out contributions if you can, as this can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current tax situation and future expectations when choosing.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits and deadlines for IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide greater flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. They can be useful for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Investment Choices**: You have a wider range of investment options here, but be mindful of tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain some liquidity in cash or a high-yield savings account for emergencies.
   - **Diversification**: Across all accounts, ensure your investment choices are diversified (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

### Considerations:
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might lean more toward stocks, while those near retirement might prioritize safer investments.
- **Long-Term Goals**: Always align your investment distribution with your long-term financial goals, retirement plans, and lifestyle aspirations.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
For personalized advice, it’s a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
