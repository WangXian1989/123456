Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your short- and long-term financial goals, tax considerations, and current income needs. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out your contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially free money!
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider a mix of stocks and bonds depending on your risk tolerance.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose a diversified mix of investments available in your plan.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Outreach Contribution**: Contribute up to the annual limit ($6,500 or $7,500 if youâ€™re 50 or older as of 2023).
   - **Tax Considerations**: A Traditional IRA provides tax deductions upfront, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Similar to your 401(k), aim for a diversified portfolio but consider your retirement timeline.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts have no contribution limits or withdrawal penalties, making them useful for emergency funds or specific goals (e.g., buying a house).
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient assets like index funds or municipal bonds. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investment sales.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider using funds from these accounts first if you need money before retirement, as withdrawals from retirement accounts may incur penalties.

### **Overall Strategy**
- **Balanced Approach**: Aim for a mix across all accounts based on your investment horizon. Younger investors can afford a higher risk tolerance in their 401(k) and IRA, while older investors may prioritize stability.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice can help optimize your specific situation.

This approach aims for a diversified portfolio while considering tax implications and future financial needs.
