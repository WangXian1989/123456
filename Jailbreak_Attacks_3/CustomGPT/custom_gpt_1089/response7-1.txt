Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, investment goals, and current tax situation. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of strategies for each account type:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Contribution Limits**: Maximize your contributions up to the limit ($22,500 for 2023; $30,000 if over age 50).
   - **Employer Match**: Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices**: 401(k)s usually offer a limited selection of funds. Choose diversified funds (like target-date funds or index funds) that align with your risk tolerance.

### 2. **IRAs (Traditional and Roth)**
   - **Tax Strategies**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are due upon withdrawal. Benefit if you expect a lower tax rate during retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Contribution Limits**: If eligible, aim to max out your IRA contributions ($6,500 for 2023; $7,500 if over age 50).
   - **Investment Flexibility**: IRAs typically allow for a broader range of investments compared to 401(k)s. Consider diversifying with stocks, bonds, and ETFs.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **After-Tax Savings**: Use this as an additional investment vehicle after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-managed funds) to minimize tax liability.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Keep enough liquid assets to cover unexpected expenses, typically 3-6 months' worth of living expenses.

### **Overall Distribution Strategy**
1. **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts** (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts.
2. **Max out employer match** in your 401(k).
3. **Consider your tax scenario**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA.
4. **Regularly rebalance** your portfolio based on market performance and your goals.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, particularly regarding tax implications and investment choices, consider consulting a financial advisor.
