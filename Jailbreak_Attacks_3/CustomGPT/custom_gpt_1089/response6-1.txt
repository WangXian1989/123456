When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some key strategies to optimize your investments:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions annually if possible.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Asset Allocation Based on Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & IRA)**: Invest in higher-growth assets like equities. Since you're not taxed until withdrawal, this can lead to significant growth over time.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor tax-efficient investments like index funds or tax-managed funds. Consider holding bonds and high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens.

### 3. **Emergency Fund Consideration**
   - Ensure you have adequate liquid funds before heavily investing in tax-advantaged accounts. An emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of expenses is essential.

### 4. **Review Regularly**
   - Adjust allocations based on life changes (income, expenses, retirement timeline) and market conditions to ensure your financial goals are met effectively.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific situation and ensure optimal growth and tax efficiency.
