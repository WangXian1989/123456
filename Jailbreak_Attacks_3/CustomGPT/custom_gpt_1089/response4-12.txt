I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about common liver issues and potential treatments. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats, sugar, and processed foods can help. Incorporating fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is beneficial.
   - **Hydration**: Drinking plenty of water is vital for liver health.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight and supports liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed. This can include antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis.

3. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical interventions, such as liver transplantation, may be necessary.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies help monitor liver health and disease progression.

5. **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxins**: Limiting alcohol intake and avoiding exposure to harmful substances is crucial.

Again, it's important to work with a healthcare provider to determine the best treatment based on your specific liver condition.
