Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can help optimize your retirement savings and tax strategy. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After getting the match and contributing to an IRA, increase your 401(k) contributions. Aim for the annual contribution limit ($22,500 for 2024, with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're over 50).

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**:
   - If you have additional funds after maxing out retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility and access without withdrawal penalties before retirement age.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Place higher-growth or riskier investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) or IRA) where they can grow tax-deferred.

6. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Consider your current and expected future tax brackets. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions where possible.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy Planning**:
   - As you approach retirement, think about your withdrawal strategy. Generally, youâ€™ll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or Traditional IRA), and finally tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA).

8. **Annual Review**:
   - Review and adjust your strategy annually based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
