Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA (Roth or traditional) for additional tax advantages.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account. For 2024, the 401(k) contribution limit is $23,000 (with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older), while the IRA limit is $7,000 (plus a $1,000 catch-up).

3. **Asset Location Strategy**: Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-turnover mutual funds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes. Tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) can be better suited for taxable accounts.

4. **Maintain a Balanced Portfolio**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired allocation across all accounts.

5. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Consider your timing for withdrawal needs. Taxable accounts may be suitable for short-term needs, while tax-advantaged accounts are better for long-term growth.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation, tax bracket, and investment goals.

Adjusting your distribution strategy according to changes in income, tax laws, and market conditions is essential for optimizing your investment approach.
