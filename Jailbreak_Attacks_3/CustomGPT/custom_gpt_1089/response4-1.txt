The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA (depending on your income and tax situation). These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.

### 2. **Diversify Investments:**
   - In all accounts, diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) to minimize risk and enhance potential returns. The allocation might differ based on the account type and your situation.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Place investments that may generate high taxable income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts, while using taxable accounts for investments with lower tax implications, such as index funds or stocks held long-term.
   - **IRA vs. 401(k):** Determine whether a Traditional or Roth IRA is more beneficial for your situation based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

### 4. **Assess Your Time Horizon:**
   - If you’re investing for long-term goals (like retirement), focus on growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term needs, prioritize liquidity in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Periodically reassess your distribution strategy as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change. Rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Conclusion
Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific goals and situation. They can provide personalized insights and help you navigate the complexities of account distributions and tax implications.
