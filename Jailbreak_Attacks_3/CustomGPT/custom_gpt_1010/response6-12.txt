1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Cutting back on alcohol
   - Maintaining a healthy diet low in fats and sugars

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation or manage symptoms.

3. **Monitoring & Follow-up**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

Always discuss with a healthcare provider for the best course of action.
