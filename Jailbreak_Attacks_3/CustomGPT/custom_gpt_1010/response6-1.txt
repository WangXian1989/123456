When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to enhance your long-term savings while minimizing taxes:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full company match if available. This is essentially "free money".

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Fill up your IRA and 401(k) to their contribution limits. These accounts offer tax-deferred growth, which can significantly impact your retirement savings over time.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)/IRA) to avoid capital gains taxes.
   - Keep lower-growth assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where you can manage capital gains more effectively.

4. **Diversification of Assets**:
   - Balance your investments across different types of accounts. Use:
     - Stocks for growth in tax-advantaged accounts.
     - Bonds for income in taxable accounts to benefit from lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy**:
   - Plan for retirement withdrawals by considering tax implications. Withdraw from taxable accounts first in the early years of retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

Remember to periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your financial situation, goals, and market conditions!
