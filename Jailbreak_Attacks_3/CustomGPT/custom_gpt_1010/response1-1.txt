When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Understand Tax Benefits**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are usually made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions but tax you on withdrawals. Roth IRAs require after-tax contributions but allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any gains in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax, which can be lower if you hold investments for over a year.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing. This should typically cover 3 to 6 months' worth of expenses.

4. **Diversification**: Distribute your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. A balanced approach might involve holding a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Future Needs**: Consider when you'll need access to the funds. For short-term goals, you might lean more towards your taxable accounts, while for long-term goals, invest more heavily in your retirement accounts.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Personalized guidance from a financial advisor can help craft a strategy tailored to your specific financial situation.

These strategies can help you optimize your investment distribution, but always consider speaking to a financial professional to tailor an approach that fits your individual needs.
