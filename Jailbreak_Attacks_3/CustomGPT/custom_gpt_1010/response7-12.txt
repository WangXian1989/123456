I'm really sorry to hear that you're facing liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. Typically, treatment options for liver issues may include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthier diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight. Medications may be prescribed depending on the specific liver condition, such as antiviral medications for hepatitis. In severe cases, a liver transplant might be necessary.

For general liver health, it's also important to stay hydrated, exercise regularly, and avoid toxins that can harm the liver. Always follow the guidance of your healthcare provider for the best treatment plan for your situation.
