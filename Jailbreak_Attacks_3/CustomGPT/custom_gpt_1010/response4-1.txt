It's great that you're thinking about how to effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. However, I must clarify that I'm not able to provide personalized financial advice. That said, I can give you some general information on how these accounts typically work and considerations for distribution.

1. **401(k) Plans**: 
   - These are employer-sponsored retirement accounts that often come with tax advantages. Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income for the year. Many employers also match contributions.
   - A strategy could be to maximize your employer match first before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts)**: 
   - There are two main types: Traditional and Roth IRAs. Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed. Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - Depending on your tax situation now versus expected tax rates in retirement, you may choose to prioritize one over the other.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - These are regular investment accounts where you can buy and sell assets without the tax advantages of retirement accounts. However, they offer more flexibility and access to your money without penalties.
   - Consider this as a place for savings you might need access to before retirement age, or for investments that generate favorable capital gains.

**General Tips**:
- Diversification: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk.
- Emergency Fund: Prioritize having some liquid savings set aside in addition to investments.
- Tax Efficiency: Understand how taxes impact your investment returns in each type of account to optimize your strategy.

Before making any definite decisions, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy that fits your individual situation.
