Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions; tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA:** Individual account, also tax-advantaged; traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages; subject to capital gains taxes but offer flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth with a balanced mix of stocks and bonds, considering your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Utilize tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Keep less tax-efficient investments (e.g., bonds, REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and hold more tax-efficient assets in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly assess your portfolio’s performance and rebalance as necessary, especially when approaching retirement or major life changes.
