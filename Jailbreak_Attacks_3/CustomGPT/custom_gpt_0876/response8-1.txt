To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits that can enhance your growth over time.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (with additional catch-up contributions allowed if youâ€™re over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500.

4. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax implications as 401(k)s. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed in the year they are realized, but they offer flexibility and no contribution limits.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk and returns. Consider using different asset allocations based on the account type:
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment options, generally focusing on mutual funds.
   - **IRA**: Offers more investment choices, including stocks, bonds, and ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider using tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize tax impact.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to keep your asset allocation aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize taxes. For example, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

8. **Consult a Professional**: Consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that optimizes your savings and investment growth while minimizing taxes.
