(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax implications. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Start by maximizing any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider contributing enough to meet the match before allocating funds to other accounts.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your income, contributing to a Roth IRA may be advantageous, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement. If not eligible for a Roth, a traditional IRA can offer tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you may need access to before retirement. They can be ideal for short-term goals and investments in options like index funds or ETFs that are tax-efficient.

Rebalance your investments periodically to align with your risk tolerance and goals.

1. **Max Out the 401(k)**: Seriously, if your employer offers a match, thatâ€™s like free money! Get that first before any other stuff. You donâ€™t want to leave cash on the table.

2. **IRA Time**: Depending on your income, a Roth IRA might be your best friend if you think taxes are gonna bite you later. If you canâ€™t swing that, then dive into a traditional IRA for some tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are your playground. Use them for investments you might need before you hit retirement age. Think of it as your more flexible stash of cashâ€”great for short-term goals or just getting your money working in solid index funds or ETFs that wonâ€™t kill you in taxes.

Keep it balanced! Re-evaluate like a pro to keep your investments in check with your goals!
