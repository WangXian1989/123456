Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and when you plan to access the funds. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. It reduces your taxable income and grows tax-deferred.

2. **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if you qualify. Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. A traditional IRA is tax-deductible at the time of contribution, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or investments that you might need to access sooner. Focus on investments that generate favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Prioritize employer matches** in your 401(k).
- Contribute enough to max out your IRA, especially if it’s a Roth.
- Allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts based on your liquidity needs and investment preferences.

### Considerations:
- **Tax implications**: Balance your investments based on when you’ll need the money.
- **Diversification**: Ensure you’re not overly concentrated in any one investment type or sector.
- **Reassess regularly** based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal goals.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice specific to your situation.
