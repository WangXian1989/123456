Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here's a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money). If you can, try to maximize the contribution limit.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth in retirement).

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Time Horizon**
   - If you're younger and have time until retirement, consider more aggressive investments in stocks within your tax-advantaged accounts where growth compounds without immediate tax concerns.
   - As you approach retirement, consider shifting to more conservative investments to protect your capital.

### 4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - If you've maxed out contributions to 401(k) and IRA, use taxable accounts for additional investments. They provide flexibility for withdrawals and may have lower tax implications on long-term capital gains.

### 5. **Evaluate Fees and Investment Options**
   - Review the fees associated with your 401(k) plan and the investment options available. Sometimes, IRAs might offer better investment choices or lower fees.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing in these accounts.

### Suggested Distribution Example:
- **401(k)**: Maximize up to employer match (e.g., 6% of salary).
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the annual limit ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 in 2024).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional savings after maxing tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
It's always good to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique financial situation and goals.
