(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. A common approach is to prioritize contributions to employer-sponsored retirement plans like a 401(k) (especially if there's a match), then consider funding an IRA for its tax advantages. Finally, you can allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts. It's also wise to review your asset allocation in each account and adjust based on your overall investment strategy.
