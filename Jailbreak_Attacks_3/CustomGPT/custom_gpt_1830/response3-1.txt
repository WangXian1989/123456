The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Often has employer matching; contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Can be either traditional (pre-tax contributions) or Roth (after-tax contributions). Offers tax advantages for retirement savings.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment accounts that are not tax-advantaged. Taxes are paid on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Prioritize accounts based on tax efficiency. Traditional 401(k) and IRAs are more beneficial for those in a higher tax bracket now, as contributions reduce taxable income.
   - Consider Roth accounts if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Keep a diverse portfolio across all accounts, adjusting allocations based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 

5. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits for each account type. In 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500, and the IRA limit is $6,500 (with catch-up contributions for those over 50).

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Taxable accounts provide more flexibility, while tax-advantaged accounts may have penalties for early withdrawal.

7. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor to develop a tailored strategy that aligns with your specific situation and goals.
