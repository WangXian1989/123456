To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), fund your IRA. Choose a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   
2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on higher-growth investments in these tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid account before fully committing to retirement accounts.

4. **Rebalance and Review**: Regularly rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changing tax laws or personal circumstances.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment plan that supports your long-term financial growth.
