The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, start by contributing at least enough to maximize this match. This is essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Pay attention to the contribution limits and the income phase-out ranges for Roth IRAs. This account can provide tax advantages depending on whether you pay taxes now (Roth) or later (Traditional).

3. **Assess Tax Efficiency**: Generally, you might want to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRAs) for growth-oriented investments (stocks) and keep more conservative investments (bonds) in taxable accounts to manage taxes effectively.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you're significantly far from retirement, you may want to adopt a more aggressive investment strategy in your retirement accounts, whereas your taxable accounts may need to have a different allocation depending on your liquidity needs.

5. **Tax Loss Harvesting in Taxable Accounts**: Keep a strategy for managing capital gains within your taxable accounts. Tax-loss harvesting can offset capital gains with losses, reducing your overall tax burden.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

A financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation. Always factor in your own risk tolerance and personal goals when making these decisions.
