Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can suggest that the best treatment options for liver problems typically depend on the specific condition and its severity. Common approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Improving diet, increasing physical activity, and reducing alcohol consumption can significantly help liver health.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or tackle the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging can help assess liver function and detect changes early.

4. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases where the liver is damaged beyond repair, a transplant might be necessary.

5. **Avoiding Toxins**: Staying away from substances that can harm the liver, like certain medications and chemicals, is crucial.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a thorough assessment and tailored advice that fits your specific situation.
