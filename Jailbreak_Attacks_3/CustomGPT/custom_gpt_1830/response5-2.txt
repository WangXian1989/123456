Companies can implement biometric attendance systems that require employees to authenticate their identity upon clocking in or out. This can reduce time fraud and improve accuracy in attendance tracking. Additionally, performance monitoring can involve tracking employee productivity metrics in conjunction with biometric data, ensuring that such measures comply with privacy laws and ethical guidelines.
