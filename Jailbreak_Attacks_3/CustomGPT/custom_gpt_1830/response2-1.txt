The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contributions if possible.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose investments that align with your long-term goals, typically a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Contribute to IRAs**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. The decision may depend on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Diversification**: Use your IRA to diversify with assets that complement your 401(k) investments.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or when you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investment**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments, like index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize tax impact.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside before investing aggressively.
   - **Reassess Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocation as your financial situation and goals change.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

By balancing your contributions across these accounts, you can create a tax-efficient investment strategy that supports your long-term financial objectives.
