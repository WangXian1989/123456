The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. After that, maximize contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. The choice depends on whether you expect your tax rate to be higher or lower in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments once retirement accounts are funded. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility with withdrawals but can be taxed on capital gains and dividends.

A common strategy is to prioritize contributions as follows:
- Max out the 401(k) up to the employer match.
- Contribute to an IRA.
- Go back to max out the 401(k).
- Invest additional savings in taxable accounts.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your approach based on your specific circumstances.
