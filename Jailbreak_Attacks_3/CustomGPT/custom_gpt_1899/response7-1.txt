Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, investment horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a breakdown of considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the match limit, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it, as the annual limit (for 2023) is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're over 50.
   - **Investment Choices**: Check the investment options and fees associated with the plan, as they can vary significantly.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: A traditional IRA may provide tax deductions on contributions, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax brackets.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're over 50.
   - **Diversification**: Use your IRA to diversify your investments. Consider allocating to assets that may have higher growth potential or more tax-efficient investments.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **After-Tax Contributions**: Investments in taxable accounts do not provide tax benefits upfront but can be strategically used for more flexible withdrawals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Choose tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax. Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts due to their higher taxable nature.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Allocate funds for short-term goals or emergencies in a taxable account, keeping in mind that this money is more accessible without penalties.

**General Strategy**:
- Start by maxing out your 401(k) contributions to get the employer match.
- Next, contribute to an IRA based on your tax situation and investment strategy.
- Finally, use taxable accounts for additional savings, especially for short-term goals or investments that may not fit well in retirement accounts.

**Rebalancing & Adjustments**:
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions, your age, and changing financial goals. 

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
