The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, future goals, tax considerations, and retirement plans. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions:** After securing any employer matching, consider contributing to an IRA. If you're eligible, a Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer immediate tax benefits, a traditional IRA might be better.

3. **Return to 401(k) Contributions:** Once you've maxed out your IRA contributions (or if you aren't eligible for a Roth IRA), return to your 401(k). Aim to maximize your contributions here as well, taking advantage of tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** If you have extra savings after funding your retirement accounts, consider putting money into taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals (without penalties) and can be used for both retirement and other financial goals.

5. **Maintain Liquidity:** Set aside an emergency fund in a liquid savings account or money market fund to cover unexpected expenses and avoid dipping into retirement accounts.

6. **Investment Strategy:** Diversify your investments across all accounts. Consider your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals when choosing asset allocation.

7. **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of the tax implications related to capital gains in taxable accounts, and the tax benefits associated with tax-deferred and tax-free accounts.

Remember to reassess your strategy periodically as your financial situation and goals evolve. It's also wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
