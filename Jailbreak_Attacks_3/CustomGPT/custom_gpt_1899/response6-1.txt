The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your specific financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Consider maximizing your contributions to this account, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible. Evaluate your eligibility based on your income and whether you have access to a workplace retirement plan.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, this could be a good option.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed in the year they are received. However, long-term capital gains on investments held for more than a year are taxed at a lower rate.

2. **Investment Horizon and Goals**:
   - **Short-Term Goals**: For money you may need in the next few years, prioritize taxable accounts or a high-yield savings account to maintain liquidity.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Maximize retirement accounts first, as they provide tax advantages that can significantly enhance your long-term growth potential.
   - **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

3. **Suggested Allocation**:
   - Aim to fully fund your 401(k) up to the employer match, then contribute to an IRA (consider the Roth for tax-free growth), and finally invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility.

Overall, continuously review and adjust your strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal financial goals. It's also advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
