The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some considerations to help you determine a suitable distribution strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (if available). This is essentially free money and a great way to enhance your retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to a Traditional 401(k) and Traditional IRA are tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now, while youâ€™ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. 
   - Roth accounts (Roth IRA and Roth 401(k)) are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Investment Time Horizon**:
   - For longer-term goals (e.g., retirement), prioritize funding your 401(k) and IRA accounts. These accounts typically have a wider array of investment options and potentially lower fees.
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or liquidity needs, as they allow for easier access to funds without penalties.

4. **Diversification and Risk Management**:
   - Maintain a balanced investment strategy across all accounts. Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider your overall asset allocation and ensure it's consistent, regardless of the account type.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund in a separate, easily accessible account (like a savings account).

6. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your contributions and investment choices as your financial situation changes, and as market conditions evolve.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation, helping you optimize your retirement strategy and tax efficiency.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a distribution strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals and helps you maximize your savings potential.
