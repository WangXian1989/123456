Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic way to approach it:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your income level, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Consider Investment Options and Fees**
   - **401(k)**: Evaluate the investment options and fees associated with your plan. If they are high, you might want to limit contributions.
   - **IRA**: Offers more flexibility in terms of investment choices compared to many 401(k) plans.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that you may need to access before retirement, keeping in mind capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Balance Risk and Accessibility**
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Focus on long-term growth. Select a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments aligned with your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider a more conservative investment strategy or keep more liquid assets here, as these can be accessed without penalties.

### 4. **Use Tax-Loss Harvesting in Taxable Accounts**
   - This strategy can offset capital gains taxes, allowing you to manage your tax liability effectively.

### 5. **Review Regularly and Adjust**
   - **Annual Check-In**: Reassess your allocation based on changes in income, market conditions, and life circumstances.

### Recommended Allocation (General Guideline):
- **401(k)**: 40-60% of your retirement savings.
- **IRA**: 20-40%, focusing either on traditional or Roth based on tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: 10-30%, depending on how much you plan to need before retirement.

### Key Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a separate emergency fund with 3-6 months’ worth of expenses.
- **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investments with your long-term financial goals and overall retirement strategy.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
