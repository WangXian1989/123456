To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and IRAs are tax-advantaged accounts, meaning contributions may be tax-deductible and investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - In a taxable account, you will pay capital gains tax on profits when you sell investments, and you may also owe taxes on any dividends or interest earned.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for both 401(k) plans and IRAs. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), while the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match before contributing to an IRA or taxable account.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. If you need the money sooner, you might prefer a taxable account to avoid early withdrawal penalties associated with retirement accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Money in a 401(k) or IRA is generally meant for retirement. If you anticipate needing access to your funds before retirement, consider allocating more to a taxable account.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Aim for a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to reduce risk. This means having a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and rebalancing periodically.

7. **Investment Options**:
   - Evaluate the investment options available in your 401(k) and IRA compared to your taxable account. Some accounts may offer better investment choices or lower fees.

Based on these considerations, a common approach might be:
- Max out your 401(k) contributions up to the employer match.
- Next, contribute to an IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.
- Any additional savings can then be allocated to a taxable account.

However, it's crucial to assess your individual financial situation and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
