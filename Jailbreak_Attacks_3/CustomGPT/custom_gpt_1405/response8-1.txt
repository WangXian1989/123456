Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you consider a balanced approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contributions to IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), affecting your taxable income. 
   - **IRA**: Similarly, traditional IRA contributions may reduce your taxable income now, while Roth IRA contributions do not.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment profits are subject to capital gains tax, so consider your expected tax rate and the time horizon for holding investments.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Needs**: Depending on your age and when you plan to access these funds, you may want to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth while keeping some liquidity in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust your contributions and investment choices based on performance, changes in your financial situation, and retirement goals.

These strategies are general and should be tailored to your specific situation. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your overall financial picture. Always consider your long-term goals, risk tolerance, and timelines when making investment decisions.
