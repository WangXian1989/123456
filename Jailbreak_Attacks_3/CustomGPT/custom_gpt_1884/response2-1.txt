When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best approach usually depends on your specific financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some strategies to keep in mind:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible (limit for 2024 is $23,000; $30,500 if you're aged 50 or older).
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. The contribution limit is $6,500 for 2024, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k):** Focus on long-term growth investments, such as stocks, since you wonâ€™t access this money until retirement.
   - **IRA:** Depending on whether you choose traditional or Roth, your investment might vary. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth, so a higher-risk investment could be beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may require liquidity or for tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, which generate less taxable income.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency Matters:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold investments that produce qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates.
   - **401(k) and IRA:** These accounts generally allow for tax-deferred growth. Bonds and high-yield investments are often better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Some strategies suggest withdrawing from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA), and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRA).

### 5. **Periodic Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts based on your financial goals and market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can tailor your strategy considering your specific circumstances, risks, and retirement goals.

Adjusting your distributions based on life events, market changes, and personal milestones is also important. Keeping these factors in mind will help optimize your investment strategy.
