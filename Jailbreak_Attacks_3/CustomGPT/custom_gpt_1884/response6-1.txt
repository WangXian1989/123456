Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Consider High Contribution Limits:** If your budget allows, maximize contributions to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth:** Assess whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) fits your tax situation better.
   - **Max Out if Possible:** Aim for the maximum annual contribution if eligible.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **For Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access within the next few years.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Tips for Distribution:
- **Assess Risk Tolerance:** Balance your investments according to your risk appetite across all accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your investment strategy.

### Final Considerations:
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** They can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.
- **Tax Implications:** Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals, especially from taxable accounts.

This approach should offer a robust framework for effective distribution among your accounts.
