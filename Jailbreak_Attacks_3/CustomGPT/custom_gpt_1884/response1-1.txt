When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Check if your employer matches contributions, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your short-term and long-term financial goals. Use taxable accounts for liquidity and short-term goals, while reserving retirement accounts for long-term growth.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. Maximize contributions to accounts with employer matches first.

4. **Withdrawal Rules**:
   - Consider the rules for withdrawals. Retirement accounts often have penalties for early withdrawals, while taxable accounts do not.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. For example, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out 401(k) contributions** to take full advantage of any employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth)**, prioritizing a Roth for tax-free withdrawals if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts**, which can serve as an emergency fund or allow for more immediate financial goals.

### Regular Re-evaluation:
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
