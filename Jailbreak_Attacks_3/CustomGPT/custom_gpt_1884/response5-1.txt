To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Max out tax-advantaged accounts first. Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then fund an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). 
   - Prioritize Roth accounts if you're in a lower tax bracket, as withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - Keep fixed-income assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals for retirement carefully, prioritizing accounts in a way that minimizes taxes over time. For example, if stocks are in your 401(k), consider withdrawing them last to benefit from potential tax-deferred growth.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure your investment is diversified across all accounts. Avoid duplicating investments in different accounts to maintain a balanced portfolio.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation as markets change.

6. **Consider Fees**:
   - Be mindful of fund fees and expenses in your 401(k) compared to IRA and taxable accounts, as higher fees can detract from returns over time.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
