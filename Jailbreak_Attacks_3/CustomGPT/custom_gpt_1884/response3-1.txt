Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before investing elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) until you reach the employer match. Consider how your 401(k) investments are allocated based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider additional contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA is generally beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, while Traditional IRAs can lower your taxable income now.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Generally, place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer or avoid taxation on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are less tax-efficient or that you might need to access sooner, such as bonds or certain dividend-paying stocks.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to minimize risk and maximize potential returns. 

5. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and rebalance your accounts based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consulting a financial planner can help align your investments with your specific circumstances and objectives.

This strategy aims to balance growth and tax efficiency while positioning your retirement savings for your future needs.
