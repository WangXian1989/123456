Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as it is essentially free money.
   - **Consider the Contribution Limit**: If you can afford it, contribute up to the annual limit.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial. Conversely, if you anticipate a higher tax rate, a Roth IRA is advantageous since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum amount allowed each year.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the short term, such as for an emergency fund or savings for major purchases.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider using taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these can be taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Balance and Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are balanced according to your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Diversify within each account to spread risk.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your allocation and adjust based on performance, changes in your financial situation, or shifts in market conditions.
