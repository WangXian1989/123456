To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Categorize Accounts by Taxation**:
   - **401(k)**: This account provides tax-deferred growth, which is beneficial for long-term savings. Maximize contributions to take advantage of employer matches if available.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether itâ€™s a traditional or Roth IRA, your tax implications will vary. A traditional IRA may offer immediate tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts should primarily hold investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains to minimize tax burden.

2. **Allocate Funds Based on Goals**:
   - **Retirement Savings**: Prioritize maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before additional funds go to taxable accounts.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Maintain a cash reserve in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies, as these funds are easily accessible without penalties.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Strategically place income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

To refine your approach, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can analyze your specific financial situation and goals.
