I'm sorry to hear you're dealing with liver issues. For personalized medical advice, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional who can provide a diagnosis and tailored treatment options based on your specific condition. Common treatment options can include lifestyle changes (diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, medical procedures or surgeries, depending on the severity of the liver problem. 

If you have any specific liver condition in mind (such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, etc.), I can provide general information on typical treatment approaches for that condition. Please let me know!
