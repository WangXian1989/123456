When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts’ Characteristics**
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers employer matching contributions and has higher contribution limits. Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals). Lower contribution limits compared to a 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility in withdrawals without penalties, but you pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. **Prioritize Based on Goals**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Considerations**: 
     - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
     - Use taxable accounts for short- to medium-term investments or when you anticipate needing funds sooner.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Assets by Account Type**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on growth.
   - **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. **Adjust Strategy Over Time**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on changing goals and market conditions.
