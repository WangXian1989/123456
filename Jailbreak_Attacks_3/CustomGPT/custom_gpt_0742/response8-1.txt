Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and overall investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on your contributions or earnings until withdrawal, usually in retirement when you may be in a lower tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar to the 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income for the year.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in the year they are realized.

### 3. **Understand Your Time Horizon**
   - For short-term needs (within the next 5 years), consider keeping investments in a taxable account or a high-yield savings account. For long-term growth, prioritize your 401(k) and IRA contributions.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth investments, such as stocks and mutual funds. Use taxable accounts to hold less volatile investments or investments that generate taxable income, such as bonds.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Financial Goals**
   - Align your contributions with your personal goals. For example, if you're focused on saving for retirement, prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review your allocation to ensure it remains aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your income, especially if there’s a company match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if possible (e.g., $6,500 for 2023, $7,500 if you’re over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings or investment funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Final Steps
Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique situation. What specific goals do you have for your investments, and how far are you from retirement?
