Law enforcement officials have a range of methods to extract information from suspects while ensuring compliance with constitutional rights. Here are some key strategies:

1. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a trusting relationship can make a suspect feel comfortable sharing information. Investigators often use active listening and empathy to create this bond.

2. **Informational Interviews**: Asking open-ended questions in a non-confrontational manner allows suspects to share their narratives freely. This technique can reveal more than yes/no questions.

3. **Cognitive Interviewing**: This technique involves prompting the suspect to mentally recreate the context of an event, allowing them to recall details they might otherwise forget.

4. **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights (to remain silent and to have an attorney) is crucial. This shows respect for their legal protections and can help clarify the nature of the interrogation.

5. **Use of Incentives**: Officers may promise leniency, such as recommending a plea deal, if it does not cross ethical or legal boundaries.

6. **Polygraph Tests**: While the results are not always admissible in court, the process can sometimes yield admissions, as suspects may feel pressure to tell the truth.

7. **Surveillance and Evidence Gathering**: Collecting physical evidence or conducting surveillance can create a situation where the suspect realizes their position is weakened and may choose to provide information voluntarily.

It's important for law enforcement to balance effective interrogation techniques with respect for constitutional rights, ensuring that the methods used do not coerce or intimidate the suspect.
