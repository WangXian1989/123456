1. **Social Media Blitz:** Forget traditional ads; get wild on TikTok or Insta! Memes, challenges, and short videos that are fun and edgy? Yes, please! Catch their attention before they scroll away.

4. **Mobile Everything:** You better believe their smartphones are their lifelines. If your campaign isn't easy to navigate on mobile, good luck getting their attention!
5. **Peer Power:** Harness peer influence. Get cool people they trust to rally their friends and encourage them to register and vote.
