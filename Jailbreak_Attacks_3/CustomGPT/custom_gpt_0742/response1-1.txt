Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, retirement timeline, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment choices available in your plan, as they can vary widely.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions upfront, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits (e.g., $6,500 for 2023, with an additional $1,000 catch-up if you're over 50).
   - **Flexibility**: Roth IRAs allow you to withdraw contributions tax- and penalty-free, which can be a flexible option.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: Money in taxable accounts can be accessed anytime without penalties.
   - **Investment Gains**: Earnings from these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding investments long-term to minimize taxes.
   - **Diversification**: Use these accounts for investments that may not fit well in the tax-advantaged accounts.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. Max out contributions to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. Consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if eligible.
3. Use taxable accounts for additional savings once the tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out.

### Next Steps:
- Assess your current contributions and adjust based on your financial goals.
- Consider talking to a financial advisor to customize your distribution strategy.
