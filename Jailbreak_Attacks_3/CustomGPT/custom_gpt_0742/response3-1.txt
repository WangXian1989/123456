Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k):** Often includes employer matching contributions, has higher contribution limits, and is pre-tax (or Roth, after-tax) which affects how and when you pay taxes.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Offers tax advantages. Traditional IRAs may allow tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices. However, you pay capital gains taxes on any profits.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing to an IRA above the 401(k) max, especially if you want to diversify your tax situation in retirement (traditional vs. Roth).

### 3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, it might be wise to prioritize Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA).
   - A mix of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts allows for strategic withdrawals in retirement to manage tax liability.

### 4. **Investment Strategies**:
   - Consider keeping higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may produce high taxable income (like bonds) or for investments you may need to access before retirement.

### 5. **Timeline and Goals**:
   - Align your contributions with your retirement timeline. If youâ€™re far from retirement, you might lean more into growth-oriented investments.
   - Assess your short-term and long-term financial goals to determine optimal account allocation.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation as your situation changes (income, family, job changes, etc.).

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k):** Maximize employer match, then contribute up to the limit.
- **IRA:** Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible, otherwise to a Traditional IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for additional investments once tax-advantaged options are maxed out.

### Conclusion:
Your specific distribution strategy will vary based on your objectives and financial situation. Would you like to delve deeper into any specific area, such as tax implications for each account type or investment choices for different risk tolerances?
