Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out contributions (up to $22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're over 50) for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA (up to $6,500, or $7,500 if over 50) based on your income and tax situation.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: Once you've maxed out retirement accounts, invest in taxable brokerage accounts. These are beneficial for short-term needs and for capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different account types to optimize tax efficiency. For example, you might hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable accounts.

5. **Consider Tax Consequences**: Withdrawals from 401(k) and Traditional IRAs are subject to income tax, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free. Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes upon selling investments.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your distribution strategy with your retirement timeline. Consider having a larger portion in tax-deferred accounts for long-term growth and utilizing taxable accounts for immediate access.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific circumstances.
