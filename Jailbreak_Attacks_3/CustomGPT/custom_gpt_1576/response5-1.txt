(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize employer match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to receive the full match.
   
2. **Tax-advantaged accounts:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as they provide tax advantages. If you have a traditional 401(k) or IRA, contributions are tax-deductible, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversify investments:** Aim for a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon in each account type.

4. **Taxable accounts:** Use these for savings goals with shorter timelines or for investments that generate tax-efficient income.

It may also help to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! Your best bet for distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts boils down to a mix of tax strategy and personal goals.

1. **401(k) first if there's a match:** Seriously, grab that free money from your employer like itâ€™s the last slice of pizza at a party. Go for the full match before you throw money anywhere else.

2. **Drown your IRA next:** Whether itâ€™s traditional or Roth, contribute like thereâ€™s no tomorrow. The tax breaks here are like candy in a kidâ€™s pocketâ€”hard to resist!

3. **Taxable accounts for flexibility:** After you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, sprinkle some cash in taxable accounts for liquidity. These are handy if you want to buy a house or fund a spontaneous trip.

4. **Invest smartly:** Diversify, diversify, diversify! Mix it up with stocks, bonds, and maybe some crypto if youâ€™re feeling adventurous. Just keep an eye on those taxes!

Bottom line: Know your goals and risk tolerance, and donâ€™t shy away from getting a financial advisor to help map it all out. You'll thank yourself later!
