Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** After the 401(k), consider contributing to your IRA (traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax strategy.

### 2. **Evaluate Investment Options:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for money you may need in the short term or for specific goals outside of retirement. Invest in assets that are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains tax.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to manage risk.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Growth is not taxed until withdrawal, making them great for long-term investments.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (like Roth IRA):** Withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. A good strategy is to have a portion of assets in these accounts for tax diversification in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains apply. Aim to hold long-term investments here to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 5. **Review Your Financial Situation:**
   - Assess your liquidity needs, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Adjust your contributions based on life changes (job changes, marital status, etc.).

### 6. **Regularly Rebalance:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

### Conclusion:
Tailoring the distribution to your personal financial situation is crucial. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insight based on your specific circumstances.
