Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here’s a suggested approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with tax advantages. Typically offers tax-deferred growth; check employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account with tax advantages. Options include traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free growth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts without tax benefits, subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough to get the full employer match**: This is essentially "free money" and should be a priority.

### 3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Contribute to your IRA**: After your 401(k) match, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA for additional tax benefits.
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: Choose based on your current versus expected future tax rates.

### 4. **Consider Investment Options**
   - **401(k)**: If your plan offers limited investment choices, diversify using low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Typically has broader investment options; consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and ETFs depending on risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Think About Withdrawal Rules**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Funds are locked until retirement (generally 59½) without penalty.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties but are subject to taxation on gains.

### 6. **Adjust Based on Goals**
   - **Short-term needs**: Keep a portion in taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Long-term goals**: Aim for retirement accounts for maximum tax benefits.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Conclusion
The best distribution strategy is personal and depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice.
