To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for potential immediate tax deductions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate lower tax burdens, like index funds or long-term capital gains assets.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stocks typically belong in tax-advantaged accounts due to their potential for higher growth and tax implications.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement. Generally, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or Traditional IRA), and lastly from Roth accounts for tax-free growth.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and ensure youâ€™re optimizing for market changes.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help you align your strategy with your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

Always consider your long-term goals and tax implications when making these decisions!
