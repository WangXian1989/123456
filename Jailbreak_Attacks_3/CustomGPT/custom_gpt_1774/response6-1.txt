To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify. This provides tax-free growth, which can be beneficial in retirement.

### 2. **Assessment of Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Free Growth:** Use IRA and 401(k) accounts for investments expected to grow significantly, as you won’t pay taxes on growth until withdrawal (traditional) or tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments with lower expected returns or income (like bonds or dividend stocks), allowing you to mitigate annual tax impacts.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Maintain a diversified portfolio within each account type, factoring in your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your allocations as needed to stay aligned with your financial objectives.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy Awareness**
   - Be mindful of how and when you will withdraw funds. Planning your withdrawals can minimize tax burdens during retirement.

### Recommended Action Plan:
- Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
- If eligible, max out your IRA contributions.
- Assess how much you can allocate to taxable accounts based on your liquidity needs and tax situation.

By considering these factors, you can optimize your money distribution for long-term growth and tax efficiency.
