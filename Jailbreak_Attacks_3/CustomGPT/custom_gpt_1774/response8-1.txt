Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Aim to max out contributions to your IRA (Roth or traditional) since these accounts offer tax benefits. The limits for contributions can change annually, so be sure to check the current limits.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Investments in your 401(k) and traditional IRA grow tax-deferred. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Growth**: Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met. If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth contributions.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Distribute your investments across different accounts to benefit from various tax treatments. For example, you might hold bonds in a tax-advantaged account and stocks in a taxable account to optimize tax efficiency.

4. **Consider Investment Goals**:
   - If you have short-term goals (like buying a house), consider keeping more funds in taxable accounts for liquidity. For long-term goals (like retirement), focus on maximizing your 401(k) and IRA.

5. **Periodic Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, adjusting for market performance and changes in your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation, including tax planning and investment choices.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **Second**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if your income limits allow.
- **Third**: Max out your 401(k) contributions.
- **Fourth**: Invest in a taxable account if additional funds are available.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to growing your investment and retirement savings. Always consider reviewing your strategy annually or when significant financial changes occur.
