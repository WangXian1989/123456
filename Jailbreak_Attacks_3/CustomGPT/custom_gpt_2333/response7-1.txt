The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if possible, as 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you are eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA distributions are tax-free in retirement.

2. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon across all three types of accounts. Having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets helps mitigate risk.

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can be used for short-term needs or emergencies and allow more flexibility in withdrawals.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from 401(k) and Traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, so plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize taxes.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Monitor your investment performance and asset allocation, adjusting your contributions and distributions as your financial situation and goals evolve.

It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
