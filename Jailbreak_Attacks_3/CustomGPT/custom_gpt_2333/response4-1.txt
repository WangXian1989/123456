To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of each account. Distributions from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income. In contrast, qualified distributions from a Roth IRA and gains in taxable accounts are treated differently.

4. **Diversify Assets Based on Account Type**: Hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA) where growth can compound tax-free or tax-deferred. For taxable accounts, consider holding more stable income-generating investments that may be taxed at lower rates.

5. **Maintain an Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in your taxable accounts for emergencies, as accessing retirement accounts may incur penalties or taxes.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**: As you approach retirement, strategize which accounts to draw from first based on your tax situation to minimize tax liability.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, consider talking to a financial advisor who can help you develop a comprehensive plan.

By balancing contributions and investment types across these accounts, you can optimize your long-term financial growth while managing tax implications effectively.
