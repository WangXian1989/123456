Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA up to the maximum allowed. This can lower your taxable income and grow your investments tax-deferred.
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.

2. **Balance for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access in the short term. This allows for more liquidity since withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties.
   - Depending on your investment strategy, consider keeping more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in taxable accounts. Long-term investments held for over a year generally incur lower tax rates than short-term gains.
   - Consider tax-efficient funds (like index funds) in your taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Revisit Annually**:
   - Review your allocation periodically based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals to ensure your distribution remains optimal.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your specific situation.
