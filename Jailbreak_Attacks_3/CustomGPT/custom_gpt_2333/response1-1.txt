Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are a few strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Generally, it's wise to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, since both accounts offer tax advantages that can enhance your long-term growth.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Taxable accounts donâ€™t offer tax advantages, so if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) to shield your investments from taxes until withdrawal.

3. **Diversification**: Make sure your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance across all account types. A balanced approach reduces overall risk and enhances potential returns.

4. **Liquidity Needs**: If you may need to access money soon, keep a portion in taxable accounts since they offer the most flexibility. Retirement accounts often have penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Age and Retirement Goals**: As you near retirement age, shift your allocation to more conservative investments in your tax-advantaged accounts to preserve capital.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your individual situation with a professional who can provide personalized advice based on current tax laws and your financial picture.

Remember, regularly reviewing and adjusting your distribution strategy is important as your financial situation and goals evolve.
