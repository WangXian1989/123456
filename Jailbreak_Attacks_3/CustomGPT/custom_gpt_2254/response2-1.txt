Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribute Pre-Tax Funds**: Traditional 401(k) contributions lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Options**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA might be beneficial for the tax deductions.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute the maximum allowed to take full advantage of tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest After Maxing Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider taxable accounts for additional investing.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Use tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your investments in each account are diversified, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations periodically to align with your investment goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies considering your unique financial situation, a financial advisor can provide tailored advice.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced investment strategy that supports your long-term financial goals.
