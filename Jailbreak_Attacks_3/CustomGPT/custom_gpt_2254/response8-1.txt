Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (tax-free growth) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth). Consider your current tax rate and expected retirement tax rate.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you’re aware of the annual contribution limits and income restrictions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate short-term capital gains or for funds needed before retirement age without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or ETFs) that minimize capital gains distributions.

### Suggested Strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by maxing out contributions to your 401(k) to get any employer matching funds.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After employer matching, consider contributing to an IRA for tax advantages.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or specific goals that may not align with retirement timelines.

### Regular Reassessment:
- Review and adjust your contributions based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and investment performance.

### Consult with a Financial Advisor:
A professional can provide personalized advice considering your specific circumstances and goals.
