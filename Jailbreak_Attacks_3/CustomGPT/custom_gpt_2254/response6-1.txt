To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k) First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the company match. This is essentially free money and boosts your retirement savings.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible for a tax-deductible IRA, contribute next, as it provides tax advantages either at the time of contribution (traditional) or during withdrawals (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or income, which may be taxed at a lower rate in the long run.

### 3. **Investment Strategies**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Allocate more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA) to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Income-Generating Investments**: Keep bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to optimize taxation on income.

### 4. **Regular Review and Adjustments**
   - **Rebalance Portfolio**: Regularly reassess your asset allocation and adjust contributions to maintain your desired investment strategy and risk tolerance.

By following these steps, you can optimize your investment strategy effectively across all account types.
