Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if possible, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, ensure a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligned with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Younger investors might prefer more aggressive growth, while those closer to retirement usually shift to more conservative investments.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or real estate) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts. This can help minimize your tax burden.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - As you approach retirement, think about how you will withdraw from these accounts. The order can affect your tax situation, with many opting to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow retirement accounts to grow.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance your portfolio based on changes in your financial goals, market conditions, and life events.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation, helping you develop a strategy that aligns with your long-term goals.

By balancing contributions and considering the tax implications, you'll build a solid foundation for your financial future.
