Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Plans**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if one is offered; it's essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Consider your current and expected future tax rates.

### 2. **IRAs (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Considerations**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This could be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide easy access to funds without penalties, making them suitable for short-term savings or specific goals.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax Implications**: You'll pay taxes on dividends and realized gains, so calculate how much you want to keep liquid for potential tax liabilities.

### 4. **General Strategy**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses saved in a separate, easily accessible account before heavily investing.
   - **Diversification**: Diversify your investments within each account type to manage risk.
   - **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might lean more towards growth assets like stocks, while those nearing retirement may focus more on fixed income or stable investments.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - Reevaluate your distribution strategy periodically to adjust for changes in life circumstances, market performance, or tax laws.

### Conclusion
A common approach might be to contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize the employer match, then fund a Roth IRA for its tax-free growth potential, and finally use taxable accounts for flexibility and further investment.
