Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is free money!

2. **Contribute to Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After Roth IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket. These contributions reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is particularly useful for short-term goals or for investments that produce favorable tax treatment (like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains).

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your asset allocation fits your risk tolerance. Generally, higher-risk investments are better in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments can go in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Revisit your investment distribution regularly to adjust for performance and changes in life circumstances or goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances and goals.
