Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, allowing for tax-free withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved before tying up too much in retirement accounts.
   - **Debt Clearance**: Pay off high-interest debt before aggressive investing.

### 3. **Consider Investment Types**
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Invest in growth-oriented assets like stocks or mutual funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on more tax-efficient investments, like index funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Rebalancing and Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your risk tolerance.
   - Plan withdrawals strategically in retirement, considering tax implications.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 30% of total savings
- **IRA**: 20%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 50%

Adapt your strategy based on your age, financial goals, and market conditions. Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor this approach to your personal situation.
