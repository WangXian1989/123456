Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Funds in a 401(k) and traditional IRA are tax-deferred, meaning you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. In contrast, contributions to a Roth IRA are made after tax, making withdrawals tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize tax liability.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - If you have short-term goals, prioritize funds in taxable accounts or consider bonds.
   - For long-term growth, focus on stock investments in your tax-advantaged accounts to take advantage of growth potential.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and investment horizon. You might hold more risky assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable ones to reduce tax exposure on gains.

5. **Rebalance Annually**:
   - Review your asset allocation annually to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions. Adjust contributions as needed.

6. **Consider Fees**:
   - Pay attention to the fees associated with your investments in each account type. Lower fees can lead to higher overall returns.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
