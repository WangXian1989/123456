Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match, as this is free money. If you can, contribute the maximum limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA ($6,500 limit for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating funds here. Keep in mind capital gains taxes when selling investments. Use tax-efficient funds, like index funds, which typically generate fewer capital gains.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Adjust your asset allocation according to the account type:
     - **401(k) and IRA**: Higher-risk assets (like stocks) for long-term growth.
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider mixing in some fixed-income or lower-risk investments to manage taxes effectively.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation, accounting for any market changes.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider seeking professional guidance tailored to your personal financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

### Summary
Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, then utilize taxable accounts. Keep an eye on tax efficiency and diversify your investments effectively. Regularly re-evaluate your strategy to stay aligned with your goals.
