To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s. Traditional accounts can lower your taxable income, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, equities are suitable for growth long-term, while fixed income and cash reserves can balance risk.

4. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - *Taxable Accounts*: Use for investments that generate capital gains or dividends that arenâ€™t tax-advantaged.
   - *IRAs/401(k)s*: Ideal for investments with high growth potential, as they defer taxes until withdrawal.

5. **Regularly Rebalance**: Review and adjust your portfolio periodically based on performance and changing goals.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for withdrawals in retirement by considering which accounts to tap first for tax efficiency and lifestyle needs.
