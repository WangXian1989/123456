Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions to either a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings or investments once you’ve maximized retirement account contributions.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** These accounts grow tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth), which is advantageous for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k):** Often limited in options; focus on efficient funds.
   - **IRA:** Utilize diverse investment strategies, including stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative assets.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider allocating less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) here to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications. Generally, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and leave tax-free accounts untouched as long as possible for maximum growth.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can help tailor a strategy based on your individual circumstances, taking into account current laws and potential changes.

### Summary:
Allocate to your 401(k) and IRA to maximize tax advantages, follow with contributions to taxable accounts, and plan for tax-efficient withdrawals to maximize your overall investment growth and minimize tax liabilities.
