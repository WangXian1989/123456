When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax and grow tax-deferred. Consider maxing out to capture employer matching.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar to a 401(k) for tax-deferred growth. If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold. They allow for more flexibility but can incur taxes on dividends and interest.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - Assess your short-term vs. long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term needs (e.g., saving for a home) and retirement accounts for long-term goals.

### 3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**
   - Align your investments with your risk tolerance. Aggressive growth might be suitable for a long-term horizon, while conservative investments may be better for shorter timelines.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to mitigate risk.

### 5. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Consider maximizing contributions to these accounts first for tax advantages.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out employer match, then contribute further if you can.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowed, focusing on a Roth if eligible.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts; focus on investments with favorable tax treatment.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically review your allocations and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your investment goals.
