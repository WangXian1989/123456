Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. If you anticipate being in a lower bracket, a Traditional IRA may be better.
   - **Annual Limits**: Aim to max out contributions annually if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide liquidity and are useful for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider municipal bonds or index funds for lower capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Invest across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.

By maximizing tax advantages and strategically choosing where to invest, you can effectively grow your wealth over time.
