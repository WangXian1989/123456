To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize contributions to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Use the **401(k)** for pre-tax contributions, which lowers your taxable income.
   - Consider a **Roth IRA** for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep some funds in **taxable accounts** for short-term needs or emergency funds, as these can be accessed without penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments expected to grow significantly, such as stocks.
   - Hold more stable or income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens on interest.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting a financial planner for personalized guidance, especially regarding tax implications and retirement strategies.

By balancing these elements, you can create a diversified and tax-efficient investment plan.
