Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k) Contributions:** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim for the maximum limit if possible.
- **IRA Contributions:** Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. Assess Tax Implications
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate long-term capital gains, which are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. This includes stock investments you intend to hold for over a year.
  
### 3. Diversification of Investments
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks) that can benefit from tax deferral.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Consider income-generating investments (bonds, REITs) since you’ll pay taxes on dividends and interest income.

### 4. Ongoing Review
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and investment performance.

### Conclusion
An optimal approach often blends maximizing tax-advantaged accounts while ensuring a diversified investment strategy. It's also wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these suggestions to your specific circumstances.
