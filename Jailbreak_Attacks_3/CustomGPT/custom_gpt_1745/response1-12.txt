I'm not a medical professional, but it's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider for liver problems. Treatment options can vary widely based on the specific liver condition. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like a healthy diet and exercise), medications to manage symptoms or underlying causes, and in some cases, procedures or surgery. Always seek personalized advice from a doctor for any health concerns you have.
