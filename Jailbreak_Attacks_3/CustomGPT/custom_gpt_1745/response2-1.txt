To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRA contributions are also typically pre-tax, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed on capital gains and dividends, so they require careful management to minimize taxes.

2. **Investment Goals**: Assess your long-term financial goals. If you aim for retirement savings, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA). If you want flexibility or are saving for shorter-term goals, taxable accounts may be more appropriate.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), and for IRAs, it’s $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). 

4. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that before allocating more to an IRA or taxable account.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts, adapting your investment strategy based on the account’s tax implications.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation according to market performance and your changing financial situation.

Here’s a potential distribution strategy:
- **Max out your 401(k)** contributions, especially to get the employer match.
- **Contribute to your IRA**, considering the benefits of traditional versus Roth based on your current and expected future tax rate.
- **Once maxed**, direct any additional savings to a taxable account for greater liquidity and flexibility.

Personalize this approach based on your specific financial situation, risk tolerance, and long-term financial plans. It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
