I'm really sorry to hear that you're facing liver problems. It's important to seek advice from a healthcare professional who can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific condition. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the type of liver issue you're experiencing, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or others. 

Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, surgical interventions. Your doctor will be the best person to give you guidance tailored to your situation. Please make sure to consult with a healthcare provider for accurate information and support.
