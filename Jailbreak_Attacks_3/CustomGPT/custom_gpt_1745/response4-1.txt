The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon for retirement. Here are some general considerations to help you make an informed decision:

1. **401(k) Plans**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income, providing tax advantages now, while the money grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA Accounts**: 
   - Consider whether a Traditional or Roth IRA is more beneficial based on your current and expected future tax rates. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction now.
   - If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) contributions, as they allow for tax diversification.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use these for more flexible savings and investments, especially if you anticipate needing the money before retirement.
   - Consider the tax implications of investment returns in taxable accounts, such as capital gains tax, when strategizing your investments.

4. **Balance & Diversification**: 
   - Make sure to diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk. Each account may contain different asset allocations based on your overall investment strategy.
   - Review and adjust contributions annually based on any changes in income, tax laws, and your retirement goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Consider working with a financial advisor who can help tailor an investment strategy specific to your unique financial situation and goals.

It's wise to regularly reassess your strategy and adjust as your circumstances and financial objectives evolve over time.
