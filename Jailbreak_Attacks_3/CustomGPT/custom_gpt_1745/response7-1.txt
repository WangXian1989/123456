To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Begin by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money" and a crucial part of your retirement strategy.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After securing the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you are eligible. IRAs offer tax advantages that can benefit your long-term growth.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if youâ€™re age 50 or older). The IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if 50+). Ensure you are aware of these limits when distributing your funds.

4. **Evaluate Tax Implications:** After you max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can allocate remaining funds into a taxable account. Consider the tax implications of your investments in this account.

5. **Diversification of Investments:** Regardless of account type, diversify your investments within each account according to your risk tolerance, age, and financial goals. This may include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Continuous Monitoring:** Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on changes in income, market conditions, and your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Tailoring a strategy that fits your specific situation can be complex, so consider seeking advice from a certified financial planner.

Remember, the right distribution strategy is unique to your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.
