To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive the employer match (if available). This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) aligns better with your tax situation.

### 2. **Diversify Investments:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Distribute your investments according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, younger investors might lean more towards stocks, while those closer to retirement might prefer bonds.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Place investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your target investment strategy.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
   - **401(k):** Max out contributions, focused on growth-oriented investments.
   - **IRA:** Diversified mix of stocks and bonds, depending on your age.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Primarily index funds or ETFs that minimize capital gains taxes.

### Key Consideration:
   - Assess your **liquidity needs** and ensure you have enough cash outside of retirement accounts for emergencies.
