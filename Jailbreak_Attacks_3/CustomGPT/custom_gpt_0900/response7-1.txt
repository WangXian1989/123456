Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a concise overview of how to approach it:

### 1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**  
   - **Why:** Take advantage of free money your employer contributes.
   - **Action:** Contribute at least enough to get the full match.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**  
   - **Why:** IRAs offer tax advantages; you may choose between Traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Action:** Aim to max out contributions if possible (e.g., $6,500 for those under 50).

### 3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**  
   - **Action:** After maxing out the IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) up to the limit (e.g., $22,500 for those under 50).

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**  
   - **Why:** These accounts offer flexibility for accessing funds without penalties, but are taxed on capital gains.
   - **Action:** Use these for investments you might need before retirement or to hold stocks with favorable long-term capital gains.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Implications**  
   - Balancing investments across accounts can help manage taxes. For instance, placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts can minimize taxes on gains.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**  
   - Analyze your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your goals.

### Suggested Distribution Model
- **Initial Focus:** 401(k) up to the match, then max out IRA.
- **Subsequent Contributions:** Direct additional savings to 401(k) then taxable accounts as needed based on life changes or financial needs.

### Personalization
Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
