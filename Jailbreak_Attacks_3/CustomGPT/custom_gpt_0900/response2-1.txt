To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand the Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to 401(k) with tax advantages, but has lower contribution limits. Taxes are paid on withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for the 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating funds elsewhere.

3. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - Contribute to your 401(k) up to the match if available.
   - Fund your IRA next, especially if it’s a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawal in retirement).
   - Consider maxing out contributions to these accounts before placing funds in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Allocate investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon within all accounts. Keep in mind that the goal is to optimize growth and reduce risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations annually or as market conditions change, keeping in mind your investment goals and any changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy based on your unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
