The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, investment timeline, and tax situation. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing up to the maximum limit, especially if you can benefit from tax advantages (traditional vs. Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need before retirement or for specific goals, like buying a home.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, lowering your taxable income now. Distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and short-term capital gains are taxed at ordinary income rates, while long-term capital gains are taxed at lower rates.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on equities in retirement accounts (401(k), IRA) since they have a longer time horizon.
   - **Lower Risk Investments**: Consider bonds or cash equivalents in taxable accounts to mitigate tax impacts on cash flows.

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically**: 
   Review your asset allocation annually to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 50% (maximize employer match)
- **IRA**: 30% (traditional or Roth depending on tax strategy)
- **Taxable Account**: 20% (for short-term needs or specific goals)

### Summary:
Balancing contributions across these accounts effectively requires understanding your cash flow needs, tax situation, and investment horizon. Working with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
