Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize employer match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you qualify (income limits apply), consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Max out 401(k) contributions:** After contributing to an IRA, focus on maxing out your 401(k) contributions, which can have a higher annual limit compared to IRAs.

4. **Consider tax implications:** For high-income years, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to reduce taxable income. In lower-income years, consider converting funds from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.

5. **Use taxable accounts for flexibility:** Taxable accounts are useful for short-term goals or if you need liquidity, as they allow for easier access to funds without penalties. Just be mindful of capital gains taxes.

6. **Diversify investments:** Ensure you have a diversified portfolio within these accounts. Focus on different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk.

7. **Review regularly:** Your financial situation and market conditions can change. Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
