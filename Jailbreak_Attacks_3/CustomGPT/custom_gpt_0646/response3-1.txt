Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach that considers tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Hereâ€™s a guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This is great for high earners.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax advantages as a 401(k), but has lower contribution limits.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have liquid assets in a savings account or money market fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses before committing significant funds to investments.

4. **Prioritize Accounts**:
   - Max out contributions in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA, Roth IRA) up to limits.
   - After reaching these limits, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts.

5. **Invest for Growth vs. Income**: 
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that produce income (like bonds) where you may prefer to manage tax impact.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

7. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Think ahead about how you will withdraw funds in retirement, as this will affect how you allocate assets among these accounts.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider professional advice tailored to your unique financial situation and long-term goals. 

By following these steps, you can optimize your portfolio for both growth and tax efficiency.
