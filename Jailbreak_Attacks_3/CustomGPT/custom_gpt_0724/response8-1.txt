To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Once youâ€™ve taken full advantage of any employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after taxes, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed in retirement.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).

4. **Prioritize Emergency Savings**:
   - Before heavily funding your retirement accounts, ensure you have adequate emergency savings (around 3-6 months of expenses) in a high-yield savings account.

5. **Allocate for Growth vs. Income**:
   - In taxable accounts, consider focusing on investments that generate capital gains rather than income, as capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation in each account and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
