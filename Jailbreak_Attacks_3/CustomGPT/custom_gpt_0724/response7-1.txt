Distributing your money efficiently among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - If youâ€™re eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Balance Between Accounts:**
   - If you have maxed out your retirement account contributions, any additional savings could go into a taxable account. This allows for greater flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Generally, prioritize tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like high-dividend stocks or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) or IRA.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals:**
   - Younger investors can focus on growth and riskier investments in their 401(k) and IRA, while older investors might consider shifting to more conservative investments as they approach retirement.

### 6. **Review and Rebalance Regularly:**
   - At least annually, review your accounts to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your specific situation and goals.
