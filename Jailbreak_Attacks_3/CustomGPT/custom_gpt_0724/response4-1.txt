Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general principles to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the maximum match; this is effectively free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as this allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are suitable for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held in these accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a broad mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts, maximizing growth in tax-deferred or tax-free accounts while using taxable accounts for more conservative strategies.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Planning for retirement withdrawals involves understanding how to minimize tax impacts from your different accounts. Prioritize withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

5. **Adjust Based on Life Stage**:
   - Younger investors may focus on growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts, while those nearing retirement may shift to more conservative investments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can greatly enhance your strategy, especially regarding tax implications and investment choices specific to your situation.

Creating a strategy tailored to your unique circumstance can help you optimize your investment across various accounts effectively.
