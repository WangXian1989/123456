Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

2. **Assess Your Financial Goals:**
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for funds you may need within the next 5 years, as they offer more liquidity and flexibility.
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments, reducing your taxable income. 

3. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   - Ensure an appropriate diversification strategy across all accounts. Align your asset allocation with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Revisit and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Monitor your portfolio regularly and rebalance as needed, especially after significant market movements or changes in your personal situation.

This strategy helps in optimizing your investments while considering tax implications and liquidity needs.
