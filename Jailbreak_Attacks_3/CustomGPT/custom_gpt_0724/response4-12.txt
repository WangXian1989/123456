It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver conditions. Treatment options will depend on the specific liver problem, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common treatments may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in severe cases, surgical interventions like a liver transplant. Your doctor can provide the best guidance based on your condition and overall health.
