Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current and expected future tax rates, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.
   - After maximizing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k).

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Focus on bonds or high-income-generating assets here since these will be taxed at your ordinary income rate upon withdrawal.

4. **Revisit Allocation Regularly**: Adjust your contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, or retirement goals to ensure you're optimizing your investments.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a financial professional can help you create a tailored strategy based on your specific situation.

This diversified approach can help grow your retirement savings while managing tax implications effectively.
