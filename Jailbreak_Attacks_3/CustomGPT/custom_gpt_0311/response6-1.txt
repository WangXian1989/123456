To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
  - Contribute the maximum to both your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
  - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens, like long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

### 2. Investment Allocation
- **401(k):**
  - Focus on high-growth investments (e.g., stocks) since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
- **IRA:**
  - Similar to the 401(k), but if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, consider holding assets with high future appreciation potential.
- **Taxable Accounts:**
  - Hold fixed income or assets that you may need to access before retirement to avoid early withdrawal penalties.

### 3. Withdrawal Strategy
- **Retirement Withdrawals:**
  - Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes; consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### Summary
- **Prioritize tax efficiency by maximizing contributions to 401(k) and IRA first.**
- **Allocate assets based on tax implications and time horizon.**

Adjust your strategy based on specific goals and individual tax situations. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights tailored to your needs.
