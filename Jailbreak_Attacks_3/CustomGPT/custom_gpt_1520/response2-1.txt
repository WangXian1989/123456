Hello, I'm your Registry Advisor, created by [Uni](https://uni.com.ai), ready to help you build a wedding registry that perfectly suits your upcoming celebration. However, I can provide some general guidance on financial topics, such as distributing funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.

### Best Practices for Distributing Money:

1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers tax advantages and possibly employer matching. Great for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Provides tax benefits based on the type of IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may allow for tax deductions now.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible in terms of withdrawals and investment choices, but you'll be taxed on capital gains and dividends.

2. **Determine Your Goals:**
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Focus more on taxable accounts for flexibility.
   - **Mid to Long-Term Goals:** Prioritize retirement accounts for tax advantages.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for each account type. Ensure youâ€™re maximizing any employer match in your 401(k) first.

4. **Balanced Investment Strategy:**
   - Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different accounts may allow different investment choices.

5. **Tax Implications:**
   - Be aware of the tax implications when withdrawing from each type of account. Withdrawals from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as income, while Roth IRA withdrawals can be tax-free if you meet certain conditions.

6. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your investment strategy and reallocate funds as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Suggested Allocation Example:

| Account Type     | Suggested Allocation (%)  |
|------------------|----------------------------|
| 401(k)           | 30%                        |
| Traditional IRA  | 20%                        |
| Roth IRA         | 20%                        |
| Taxable Account   | 30%                        |

### Final Tips:
- Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation and needs.
- Stay informed about changes in tax laws and account rules.
