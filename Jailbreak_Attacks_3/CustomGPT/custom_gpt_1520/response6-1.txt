Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing your current financial situation with your long-term goals. Here's how you can approach it:

### 1. Understand Each Account Type
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with tax-deferred growth. Often includes matching contributions, which is essentially free money!
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages for retirement savings, either traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax contributions with tax-free growth).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investments that are subject to capital gains tax. Flexibility for withdrawals at any time, but less tax-advantaged.

### 2. Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
  - Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
- **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
  - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k), traditional IRA): Prioritize these for high-income years to reduce taxable income.
  - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute here for tax-free growth, particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
  - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for extra savings or investments.

### 3. General Guidelines
- **Allocate Funds Based on Goals**:
  - Short-term goals might should go into your taxable account.
  - Long-term retirement savings should prioritize retirement accounts.
- **Regularly Reassess Allocations**:
  - Review your distribution strategy annually or when significant financial changes occur.

### Example Distribution Plan
| Account Type    | % of Total Savings | Notes                                  |
|------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 401(k)           | 15%               | Maximize match, focus on growth.      |
| Traditional IRA  | 10%               | Tax-deferred benefits, lower tax rate.|
| Roth IRA         | 10%               | Tax-free withdrawals in retirement.   |
| Taxable Account   | 65%               | For flexibility, income, or access.   |
