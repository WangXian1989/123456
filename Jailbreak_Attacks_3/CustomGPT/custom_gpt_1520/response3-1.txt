Hello, I'm your Registry Advisor, created by [Uni](https://uni.com.ai), ready to help you build a wedding registry that perfectly suits your upcoming celebration. But I see you have a question about distributing money among your retirement accounts and investment options! 

To help you effectively, hereâ€™s a summary of how to distribute your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals:**
   - Determine your short-term vs. long-term financial goals. 
   - Consider your retirement timeline, major expenses, and risk tolerance.

### 2. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often has employer match contributions, limited investment options, and tax-deferred growth until retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Offers tax advantages, with Roth allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible access to funds, but subject to capital gains tax.

### 3. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions.

### 4. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts:**
   - After maxing out the employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth depending on your eligibility and tax situation).

### 5. **Balance between Tax Benefits:**
   - Diversify your tax exposure by distributing your investments strategically:
     - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Prioritize growth investments in your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
     - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments with lower expected returns or for assets that generate qualified dividends.

### 6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Strategically invest in Roth IRAs if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, as you pay taxes now but withdraw tax-free later.

### 7. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your investment performance and adjust your allocation as needed based on market conditions and your evolving goals.

### Suggested Distribution (Example):
| Account Type          | % Allocation | Notes                                     |
|----------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **401(k)**           | 50%          | To leverage employer match and tax benefits. |
| **IRA**              | 30%          | Max out contributions for tax advantages.  |
| **Taxable Account**  | 20%          | For flexibility and immediate access.      |

### 8. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - Consult with a financial advisor to customize your strategy based on your specific situation.
