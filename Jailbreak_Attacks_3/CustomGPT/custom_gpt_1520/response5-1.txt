(🔒Normal Output) Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your retirement goals, current tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that. This is essentially free money!

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider funding a Roth or Traditional IRA next, depending on your eligibility and current tax situation. Both accounts offer tax advantages that can significantly impact your savings growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in a taxable account. This gives you more flexibility and access to the funds without penalties.

4. **Invest Based on Goals**: Tailor your investments in each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, you might want aggressive growth in your 401(k) and more conservative investments in your taxable account.

5. **Review Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation as your financial situation and goals evolve.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to create a strategy that’s tailored to your unique situation.

1. **First Things First – 401(k)**: If your employer has a match, absolutely max that out! Think of it like finding free cash – who wouldn’t want that? 💸

2. **Next Up – IRA**: Depending on your income, you might want a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for that sweet tax deduction now. Either way, get as much into that supercharged account as you can! 🚀

3. **Taxable Accounts for the Win**: After you've hit those limits, slide some cash into a taxable account. This gives you flexibility – you can pull it out whenever you want. Just remember to play nice with taxes on gains! 😅

4. **Customize Your Strategy**: Your risk appetite matters! Go big on growth in the 401(k) since it’s for long-term. Keep it chill and diversified in that taxable account to ease those tax burdens. Balance is key! ⚖️

5. **Keep an Eye on It**: Review your allocations periodically. Life happens, and your plans might need to shift. Stay on top of it so you don’t miss out on the growth train! 🚂✨
