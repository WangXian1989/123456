Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. 

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deferred, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, so consider holding assets that appreciate slowly or generate qualified dividends.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. 
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation across accounts.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - In retirement, plan which accounts to draw from first to minimize tax impact. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

### 5. **Individual Goals and Circumstances**
   - Tailor your strategy based on personal goals such as home purchase, education savings, or early retirement. 

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - It can be beneficial to discuss your strategy with a professional who can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

### Summary
Start by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, then consider diversification and tax implications in your investment strategy. Plan withdrawals strategically to minimize tax burdens in retirement.
