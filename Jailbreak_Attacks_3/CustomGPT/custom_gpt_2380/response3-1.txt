Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors such as your retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Aim to max out contributions if possible, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions now. Individual contribution limits apply.

2. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals, utilize taxable accounts where withdrawals are more flexible.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, diversify between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, stocks are better for long-term growth, while bonds can stabilize returns.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Keep higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income, such as tax-exempt bonds.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your distribution strategy as your financial situation and goals evolve. Rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider getting personalized advice from a financial advisor who can help tailor your investment strategy to your specific needs and goals.

By balancing contributions across these accounts and considering tax implications, you can create a more efficient investment strategy that benefits your overall financial health.
