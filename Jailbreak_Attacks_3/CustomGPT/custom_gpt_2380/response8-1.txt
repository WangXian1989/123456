Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contributions**: If possible, try to maximize your 401(k) contributions. The contribution limits (as of 2023) are higher than those for IRAs.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial.
   - **Backdoor Roth IRA**: If you exceed the income limits for Roth contributions, consider a backdoor Roth IRA strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments like stocks or ETFs that are more tax-efficient due to lower capital gains taxes.
   - **Bonds in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Keep interest-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts to avoid short-term capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before making significant contributions to retirement accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Withdrawals from taxable accounts may be more flexible, while tax-advantaged accounts often have restrictions and penalties for early withdrawal.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

By optimizing contributions and considering tax implications, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
