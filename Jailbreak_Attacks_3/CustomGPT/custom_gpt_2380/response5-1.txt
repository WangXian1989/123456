Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, age, and tax situation. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. Maximize Employer Contributions
- **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially "free money."

### 2. Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) match. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may lower your taxable income now.
  
### 3. Assess Contribution Limits
- Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type:
  - **401(k)**: $22,500 for individuals under 50 (as of 2023), $30,000 for those 50 and older.
  - **IRA**: $6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and older.

### 4. Prioritize High-Interest Debt
- Before allocating a large amount to investments, consider paying off high-interest debt.

### 5. Taxable Accounts for Flexibility
- Invest in taxable accounts for needs beyond retirement or if youâ€™ve reached your contribution limits for tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts offer liquidity and don't have required minimum distributions (RMDs).

### 6. Diversification
- Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified to manage risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 7. Rebalance Regularly
- Periodically review your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

### Key Considerations
- **Age**: Younger investors may focus more on growth; older investors might prioritize capital preservation.
- **Tax Situation**: Evaluate current and expected future tax brackets, as this could influence account choices.
- **Goals**: Retirement savings should take precedence, but keep liquidity needs in mind for short- to medium-term goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can further tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
