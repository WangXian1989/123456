Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment timelines. Here is a general guideline to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Maximize employer match: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing enough to take advantage of tax deferral. Remember that 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - Traditional IRA contributions may also be beneficial for tax deductions, depending on your income level and eligibility.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be beneficial for short-term goals.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in taxable accounts. Favor investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds or ETFs that are more tax-efficient.

### Summary of Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k) contributions**, especially to get the employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA** (Roth or Traditional) according to your tax situation and income.
- **Invest in taxable accounts** for any excess savings, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Further Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before fully committing all your investment funds.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all account types.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances, risk tolerance, and financial goals.

By strategically distributing your money among these accounts, you can optimize your savings for both your present and future needs.
