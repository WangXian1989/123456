When determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA (depending on your eligibility and tax situation). IRAs can offer tax advantages such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA).

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k):** Once you've maxed out any IRA contributions (the 2023 limit is $6,500 or $7,500 if you're 50 or older), go back to your 401(k) to contribute more, ideally aiming to reach the annual limit ($22,500 or $30,000 if you're 50 or older for 2023).

4. **Taxable Accounts:** If you have additional funds to invest after maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This can provide flexibility and access to your money without the penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:** Regardless of account type, maintain an appropriate asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Diversifying your portfolio can help mitigate risks.

6. **Tax Efficiency:** Consider the tax implications of where you hold specific assets. Generally, itâ€™s best to hold bonds and other income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs and 401(k)s) and keep growth-focused investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Review:** Periodically review your investments and contributions to ensure they align with your financial goals and adjust based on changes in your circumstances or financial goals.

Ultimately, the right distribution strategy will depend on your unique financial situation, so it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
