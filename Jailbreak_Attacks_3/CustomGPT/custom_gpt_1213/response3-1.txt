Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach to consider when allocating your investments:

### **1. Analyze Your Tax Situation:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. Consider maxing out any employer match.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth):** Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met). Your current tax rate versus your expected retirement tax rate can guide your choice.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are taxed annually on any dividends, interest, and realized capital gains, so consider the tax implications of the assets you choose.

### **2. Assess Your Investment Goals:**
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term:** If you need to access your funds in the near future, prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity. For long-term growth, max out retirement accounts first, taking advantage of tax-advantaged growth.

### **3. Establish an Asset Allocation Strategy:**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and sectors, regardless of the account type.
   - Keep more volatile investments (like stocks) in Roth IRAs or taxable accounts to maximize tax efficiency over time, while placing more stable assets (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts.

### **4. Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s, IRAs, and other retirement accounts to maximize tax benefits.
   - For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50 or older), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older).

### **5. Regularly Rebalance:**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering the performance of each account.

### **6. Seek Professional Advice:**
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique financial situation and goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out 401(k) Contributions:** Aim to meet the employer match first as it’s essentially “free money.”
- **Contribute to an IRA:** Depending on your tax considerations, you may choose either a Traditional or Roth IRA next.
- **Invest in a Taxable Account:** Any additional savings can go into a taxable account for more immediate needs or investment flexibility.

This strategy ensures you take full advantage of all available tax benefits and maintain a diversified investment approach.

### Conclusion:
Every individual’s situation is different—keep your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon in mind as you distribute your savings across these accounts.
