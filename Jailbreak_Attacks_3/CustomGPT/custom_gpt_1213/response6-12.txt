To provide you with the best guidance regarding liver problems, I can structure the information as a hypothetical SOAP note based on the common treatment approaches for liver diseases. However, keep in mind that specific treatments should always be determined by a healthcare professional based on a thorough evaluation.

She notes mild abdominal discomfort, particularly in the upper right quadrant. She has a history of alcohol abuse but has been abstinent for the past six months. The patient also mentions occasional nausea and loss of appetite. There is no known family history of liver disease.

### **PEARLS:**
- Early intervention and lifestyle changes can significantly alter the progression of liver disease, especially in cases linked to alcohol use.
