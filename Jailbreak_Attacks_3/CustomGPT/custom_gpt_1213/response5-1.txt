(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your specific financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, as these accounts offer tax advantages that taxable accounts do not. After contributing to these retirement accounts, any additional savings can go into taxable accounts, giving you the flexibility to access your money without penalties before retirement age. It's always helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
