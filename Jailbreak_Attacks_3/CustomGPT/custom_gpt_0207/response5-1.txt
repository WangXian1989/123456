Distributing your money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Max Contributions**: Aim to contribute at least enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider a Roth 401(k) if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: A Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you’re aware of and maximize annual contribution limits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you expect to access funds before retirement. 
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) and consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### Strategy Summary
- **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts** (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
- Balance investments between accounts based on your time horizons and liquidity needs.
- Adjust your allocations annually or as your financial situation changes.
