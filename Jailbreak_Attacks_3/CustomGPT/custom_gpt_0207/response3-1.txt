Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching funds, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out contributions if your employer offers a match. The contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional funds here. While they donâ€™t offer the tax advantages of retirement accounts, they provide flexibility and access without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering the different tax impacts of each account type.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals and capital gains in your taxable accounts compared to tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, consider where withdrawals will come from based on tax efficiency and your overall income strategy.
