2. **Medications**
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation or manage symptoms.

3. **Regular Monitoring**
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and detect any complications early.

4. **Avoid Toxins**
   - Stay away from substances that can harm the liver, including alcohol and certain medications.
