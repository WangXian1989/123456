The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your overall financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match before putting money in other accounts. Consider making additional contributions if you can, especially if your contributions are tax-deductible.
   - **IRA**: If you can, contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The contribution limits and eligibility vary, so assess your situation.

2. **Diversification and Liquidity**: 
   - Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and can be useful for short-term goals. However, keep in mind that capital gains taxes apply here. Consider keeping emergency funds and funds for upcoming expenses in these accounts.
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts, taking into account the tax implications of buying or selling investments in taxable accounts.

3. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

4. **Review and Adjust**: 
   - Regularly review your investment allocation based on changes in income, market conditions, and life goals, and adjust your contributions accordingly.

It's always a good idea to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
