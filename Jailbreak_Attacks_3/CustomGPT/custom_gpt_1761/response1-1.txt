The best way to distribute your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a matching contribution, take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially free money. Additionally, 401(k) plans often have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth based on your eligibility). Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can provide flexibility in terms of access to funds before retirement age without penalties. It's a good place to hold investments that generate long-term capital gains (which are taxed at a lower rate) and investments like municipal bonds, which can be tax-exempt.

### Considerations:
- **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications associated with each account type.
- **Liquidity Needs**: If you might need access to funds in the near term, prioritize taxable accounts.
- **Investment Strategy**: Tailor your investments based on risk tolerance. 

It's important to review your entire financial situation or consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan based on your individual circumstances.
