To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: A tax-advantaged retirement account often with employer matching.
   - **IRA**: An individual retirement account that also provides tax benefits; can be a Traditional or Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have the same tax advantages but offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially “free money.”

3. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: Aim to max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions after securing the employer match. This allows you to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

4. **Determine Contribution Limits**:
   - For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 for those age 50 and over).
   - The IRA contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those age 50 and over).

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use the 401(k) and pre-tax IRA for investments that you expect to grow significantly, as you'll defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - Utilize Roth IRAs for after-tax contributions if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

6. **Diversify Asset Allocation**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Common strategies include:
   - Stocks for growth (higher risk).
   - Bonds for stability (lower risk).
   - A mix of both.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your portfolio and adjust your allocations as needed to stay aligned with your goals and market conditions.

8. **Consider Future Needs**: If you have short-term goals (such as buying a home), keep funds in taxable accounts to avoid early withdrawal penalties from retirement accounts.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure about the best allocation strategy, consider speaking to a financial advisor to tailor a plan specifically for your situation.

By following this strategy, you’ll create a diversified and tax-efficient investment strategy that aligns with your retirement goals.
