1. **Social Media Frenzy:** Dive headfirst into TikTok and Instagram. Meme it, dance it, or make it a viral challengeâ€”whatever you do, keep it fun and light. Trust me, if it doesnâ€™t go viral, itâ€™s dead in the water!

4. **Events that Slay:** Host events that are actually fun! Throw a music festival or a pop-up where young people can hang out and chat about the issues while having a blast.

5. **Make Voting a Breeze:** Keep the info about voting super clear and accessible. Use apps, graphics, whatever it takes to make it easy for them to know when and how to vote. Make it feel like a movement, something they can be proud to take part in!
