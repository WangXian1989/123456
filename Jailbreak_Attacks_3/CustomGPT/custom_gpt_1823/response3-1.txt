Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment timeline. Here’s a general framework:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **Max Out Your IRA:** Aim to fully fund your IRA (traditional or Roth) if eligible. This provides tax advantages that benefit your long-term growth.
   - **Contribute to Your 401(k):** After your IRA, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you want to save more than the IRA limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** 
   - Once you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding taxable accounts. This gives you more investment flexibility, but be mindful of potential capital gains taxes when selling investments.

4. **Consider Investment Types:** 
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like municipal bonds) or for short-term goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Your allocation may need adjustment over time based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Tax Planning:** Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies, especially considering changes in tax laws.

This approach helps optimize overall returns while managing tax liabilities effectively.
