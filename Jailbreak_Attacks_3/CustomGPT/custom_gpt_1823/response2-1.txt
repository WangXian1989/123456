Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can help you maximize tax advantages and grow your wealth. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Prioritize Your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRAs**: After securing the match, consider maxing out your IRAs (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may reduce your taxable income now.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maximized your 401(k) and IRA contributions, use taxable accounts for additional investing. These accounts provide more liquidity, which can be useful for early withdrawals or if you want to invest in specific assets not available in retirement accounts.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll owe taxes on dividends and capital gains, so consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Balance Your Investments**: Diversify your investments across accounts. Keep growth-oriented assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and consider holding more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability on interest income.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and tax laws may change, so review your distributions yearly to ensure they align with your goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
