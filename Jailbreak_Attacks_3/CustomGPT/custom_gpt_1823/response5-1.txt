Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. If you can afford it, aim to contribute the maximum allowed. These contributions are tax-deferred until withdrawal, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA for additional tax perks, or a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free growth (subject to income limits). If you’re eligible, maxing out these accounts can enhance your tax efficiency.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments with high growth potential or for funds you may need before retirement. This allows for more flexible withdrawals, though you'll face capital gains taxes on earnings. 

The key is to balance between these accounts based on your retirement timeline and current tax implications. 

### Tips:
- **Diversification**: Ensure that each account has a diversified mix of assets tailored to your risk tolerance and timelines.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed to align with your financial goals.

It might be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific situation.
