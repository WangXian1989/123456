Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several key factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax implications. Here’s a general strategy to help guide your decisions:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money. Aim to reach the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: After the 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages. Both accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance long-term growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be used for investments and savings outside of retirement. They are more flexible but may incur capital gains taxes when you sell assets. Use taxable accounts for investments that are less likely to produce large taxable income (like index funds).

### 3. **Balance Your Investment Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your comfort with risk, age, and retirement timeline. Generally, younger investors can afford to take more risks, while those closer to retirement might seek more stable investments.
   - **Diversity**: Ensure a healthy mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to mitigate risk and enhance potential returns.

### 4. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**
   - **Adjust Contributions**: As your financial situation or retirement goals change, continue to evaluate and adjust where you allocate funds. 

### 5. **Consult with Financial Advisor**
   - If feasible, work with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.

By strategically using each type of account, you can optimize your investment growth and tax efficiency.
