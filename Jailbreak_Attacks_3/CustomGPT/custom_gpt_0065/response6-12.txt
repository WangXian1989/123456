I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can support liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis), antiviral or immunosuppressive drugs may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests and ultrasounds to monitor liver function and progression.

4. **Avoid Alcohol**:
   - Complete abstinence from alcohol is crucial to prevent further liver damage.

5. **Supplements**:
   - Some antioxidants, like milk thistle, may support liver health, but consult with a healthcare provider first.
