To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; prioritize this for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA:** Focus on a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

### 2. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Balance investments according to your risk tolerance. Consider stocks in growth accounts (like IRAs) and bonds in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly assess and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired allocation.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement, often starting with taxable accounts to allow tax-deferred growth in retirement accounts for as long as possible.

### Summary
- **Maximize employer match in 401(k) first.**
- **Consider tax implications for each account type.**
- **Regularly rebalance investments based on market conditions and your goals.** 

This approach helps optimize your savings while minimizing tax liabilities over time.
