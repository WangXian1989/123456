Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### Allocation Strategies

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to at least contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use 401(k) and IRA accounts for long-term growth, as they offer tax benefits.
   - Allocate assets that may be taxed at higher rates (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable accounts, where long-term capital gains rates may be lower.

3. **Set Investment Goals**:
   - Focus on retirement accounts for long-term growth, keeping in mind age and risk tolerance.
   - Use taxable accounts for more flexible investments that you might need access to before retirement.

4. **Diversify**:
   - Ensure a balanced mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts. Consider asset allocation strategies based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your goals, especially as you age or your financial situation changes.

### Example Allocation
- **20% in 401(k)**
- **20% in IRA**
- **60% in taxable accounts**

### Consult a Financial Advisor
If unsure, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific needs.

### Conclusion
The best distribution will vary based on personal circumstances, so consider both your short-term liquidity needs and long-term growth objectives as you allocate funds.
