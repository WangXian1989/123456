The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your income, tax situation, and long-term goals. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts often have tax advantages that can grow your savings more efficiently.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is particularly useful if you need flexibility for withdrawals or if you've reached contribution limits on retirement accounts.

4. **Consider Taxes**: Understand the tax implications of each type of account. For instance, withdrawals from a Traditional 401(k) and IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk and meet your financial goals. Stock-heavy investments might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to their potential for growth.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, it's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor.

Adjust your strategy based on your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and any other individual financial goals.
