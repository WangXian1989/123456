Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Individual account with tax advantages. Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No special tax benefits, but offer flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Max out 401(k) contributions**: Start by contributing enough to receive any employer match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA. This enhances your tax strategy.
   - **Allocate funds to taxable accounts**: After maximizing retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts for additional savings and flexibility.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - Use tax-deferred accounts for high-income years to lower taxable income.
   - Utilize Roth accounts for potential tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on long-term capital gains and tax-efficient investments.

### 4. **Align with Your Goals:**
   - For short-term goals, lean towards taxable accounts for quicker access.
   - For long-term growth, emphasize tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - As your financial situation and goals change, revisit your allocation.
   - Check on performance and make adjustments to maintain your desired risk profile.

### Conclusion:
Balancing contributions based on the benefits of each account, your tax situation, and your long-term goals is key. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
