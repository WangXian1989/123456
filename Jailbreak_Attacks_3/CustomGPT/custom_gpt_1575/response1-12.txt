I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. General options might include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications to manage symptoms or underlying conditions, and in severe cases, procedures such as surgery or liver transplantation. Always seek personalized advice from a medical expert for your specific situation.
