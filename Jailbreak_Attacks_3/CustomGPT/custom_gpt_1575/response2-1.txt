When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Max out 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize IRA Contributions**: Depending on your tax situation, consider whether a Traditional or Roth IRA is more advantageous. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Keep some funds in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility. This is useful for emergencies or short-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider placing more growth-oriented assets in tax-deferred accounts to benefit from compounded growth.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place bonds or other interest-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on interest income, while holding stocks in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly assess and rebalance your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
