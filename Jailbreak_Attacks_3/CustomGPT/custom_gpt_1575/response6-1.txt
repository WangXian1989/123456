To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:  
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maximizing employer matching contributions for free money.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible but face capital gains taxes. They are great for investments you might need to access before retirement.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) across accounts based on their tax treatments.
   - Consider placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) to maximize tax-free or tax-deferred growth.

3. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your asset allocation periodically, considering market conditions and changes in your risk tolerance or financial goals.

By employing these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for both growth and tax efficiency.
