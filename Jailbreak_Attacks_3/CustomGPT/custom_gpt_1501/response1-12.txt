It's really important to consult a healthcare professional about liver problems, as they can provide the best treatment options tailored to your specific condition. Treatment can vary widely depending on the type of liver issue you have, like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis, among others. They may suggest lifestyle changes, medications, or in severe cases, procedures or surgery. Please reach out to a doctor for the most accurate advice!
