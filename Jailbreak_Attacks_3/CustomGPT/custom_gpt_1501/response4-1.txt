Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be based on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA might be beneficial for reducing your taxable income. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA could be more advantageous.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may produce short-term gains or for funds you might need before retirement age. Consider holding tax-efficient investments in these accounts, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - Review your allocations periodically and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and help you optimize your strategy.

Always keep in mind your long-term goals and stay informed about tax laws, as they can impact your investment strategy.
