When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the entire match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you're over 50).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes paid on withdrawals) and a Roth IRA (taxes paid on contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Maximize Contributions**: The limit for IRAs in 2024 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investments without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) or consider holding investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with your 401(k) to get the full employer match, then contribute to an IRA (preferably a Roth if you're eligible), and finally invest in taxable accounts.
2. **Adjust Based on Goals**: Tailor contributions based on your retirement timeline, tax situation, and income needs. 

### Regular Review:
- Reassess your allocations annually or as your financial situation changes to optimize for growth and tax efficiency.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your unique circumstances.
