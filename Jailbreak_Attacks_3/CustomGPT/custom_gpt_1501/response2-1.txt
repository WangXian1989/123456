Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some tips to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be beneficial for flexibility and access to funds without penalties. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Make sure your investments are diversified across all accounts. Consider using taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize yearly tax burdens.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw money in retirement. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Adjust your allocations periodically based on changes in your investment performance and life circumstances.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help tailor your strategy based on your individual situation and goals.

By blending these strategies, you can work towards a balanced approach that maximizes your savings while minimizing tax liabilities.
