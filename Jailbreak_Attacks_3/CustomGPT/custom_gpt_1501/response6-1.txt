To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for potential immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate high taxes (e.g., bonds or frequent trading). Keep assets for long-term growth (like stocks) to minimize short-term capital gains.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance in each account type, remembering that your time horizon matters. 

### 4. **Continuous Review and Rebalance**
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and adjust contributions to maintain your desired risk level.

By taking advantage of these strategies, you can optimize your investments for growth while managing taxes effectively.
