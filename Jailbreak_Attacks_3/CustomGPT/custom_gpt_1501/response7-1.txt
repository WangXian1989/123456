Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize any employer match first, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free.

2. **Evaluate Tax Brackets**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, focusing on tax-deferred accounts (like a traditional 401(k) or IRA) may be beneficial.
   - In contrast, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, contributing more to Roth accounts can save you money in the long run.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement. They can also provide capital gains and dividend tax strategies.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (where taxes are deferred), and consider holding more stable or dividend-paying investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - Periodically review your allocations based on changes in your income, retirement goals, and tax situations.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - A financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.

Balancing contributions across these accounts takes strategy, so it’s crucial to plan according to your unique situation.
