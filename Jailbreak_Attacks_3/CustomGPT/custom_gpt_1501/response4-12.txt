I'm not a medical professional, but I can offer some general advice. It's crucial to consult a healthcare provider for tailored recommendations based on your specific condition. Common treatments for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, such as reducing alcohol consumption and eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and any changes over time.

4. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or even liver transplant might be necessary.

Always discuss with your doctor for the best treatment plan for your situation.
