To provide tailored guidance, let's start with some essential information:

1. **Goals**: What are your long-term financial goals? (e.g., retirement, purchasing a home, education)
2. **Current Age**: How old are you? This helps in understanding your time horizon for investments.
3. **Risk Tolerance**: Are you comfortable with high-risk investments, or do you prefer conservative options?
4. **Current Balances**: What are your current account balances in each type of account?
5. **Contribution Limits**: Are you aware of the contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA for this year?

Once I have this information, I can provide more specific recommendations.
