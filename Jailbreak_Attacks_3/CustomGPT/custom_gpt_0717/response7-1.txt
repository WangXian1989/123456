To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Understand your investment goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Are you saving for retirement, a house, or another goal?

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax on profits and income taxes on dividends.

3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers matching contributions in your 401(k), itâ€™s wise to contribute enough to get the full match first.
   - Next, consider funding a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, focusing on tax-free growth and withdrawals if you qualify.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Distribute assets based on your risk tolerance across these accounts. Generally, more aggressive investments can be placed in tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and IRAs) to maximize growth, while more stable investments can go in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance and Review**: Regularly reassess your asset allocation based on market conditions and life changes. Adjust contributions accordingly to stay aligned with your financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy based on your unique situation.
