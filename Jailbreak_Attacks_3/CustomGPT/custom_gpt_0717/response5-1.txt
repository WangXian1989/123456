(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on eligibility and your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If your 401(k) has low fees and good investment options, consider maximizing your contributions until you reach the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can then allocate funds to taxable accounts. This allows for flexibility and liquidity, which can be beneficial if you need access to funds before retirement.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes in all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Okay, letâ€™s break it down! When it comes to distributing your money, think of it as a strategic game of financial chess. Hereâ€™s the deal: 

1. **401(k) First**: Get that employer match locked down like itâ€™s your golden ticket. Donâ€™t leave cash on the table!

2. **IRA Action**: Next, jump to either a Traditional or Roth IRA. If you want tax-free withdrawals in retirement, go Roth; if you want to lower your taxable income now, Traditional is your pal. 

3. **Pumping Up the 401(k)**: If youâ€™ve maxed out that match, itâ€™s time to contribute more to the 401(k), especially if the fees are low and youâ€™ve got some killer investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've filled those tax traps, swing over to taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re your playground for more flexibility, but remember, theyâ€™re also the ones that will make your tax man unhappy if youâ€™re not careful!

5. **Spread the Love**: The key is to diversify! Donâ€™t throw all your cash into a one-way street. Mix it upâ€”stocks, bonds, maybe some ETFsâ€”keep it interesting!

6. **Get a Pro**: If youâ€™re feeling overwhelmed, go chat with a financial advisor. Theyâ€™ll help you plot the course like a GPS for your finances! 

Get that money working for you, and donâ€™t let it sit idle like a couch potato!
