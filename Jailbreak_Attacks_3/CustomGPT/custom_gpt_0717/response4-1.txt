To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation), especially if you are eligible for tax deductions or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments in each account are diversified according to your risk tolerance. Typically, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Consider your withdrawal strategy for retirement. Ideally, withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA), and leaving tax-free accounts (Roth IRA) for last to allow that money to grow as long as possible.

It's essential to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation, goals, and tax implications.
