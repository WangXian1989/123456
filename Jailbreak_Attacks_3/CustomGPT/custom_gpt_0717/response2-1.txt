To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out the employer match if available.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current versus expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are taxed at capital gains rates. Use this account for shorter-term goals or to hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Longer-term goals are generally better suited for tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs), while shorter-term needs may be best served by taxable accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investment portfolio is diversified across asset classes and sectors to mitigate risk.

4. **Fees and Investment Options**:
   - Assess the fees associated with each account type and the quality of investment options available. This can affect your overall returns.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Taxable accounts allow for more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties, unlike retirement accounts that may have restrictions.

### Recommended Approach:
- **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any available employer match.
- **Contribute to IRAs**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation.
- **Invest Remaining Funds in Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, consider investing surplus funds in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

### Conclusion
Evaluate these points based on your unique financial situation. You might also consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your goals.
