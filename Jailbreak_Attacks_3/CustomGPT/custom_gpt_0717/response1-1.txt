To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**: 401(k) and IRAs offer tax advantages such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (in the case of Roth IRAs). Focus on maximizing contributions to these accounts to take advantage of tax benefits.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account:
   - 401(k): For 2023, the limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if over age 50).
   - IRA: You can contribute up to $6,500 ($7,500 if over age 50) across traditional and Roth IRAs.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Your investment strategy should align with your retirement goals and the time until you retire. Longer time horizons may allow more risk in your asset allocation, especially in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Taxable accounts allow for more flexibility in withdrawals without penalties. Consider funding these accounts for short- to mid-term goals while utilizing retirement accounts for long-term growth.

5. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, be sure to contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money!

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts to minimize risk.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
2. Maximize IRA contributions based on your eligibility and tax situation.
3. Consider additional contributions to your 401(k) or taxable accounts based on your cash flow and investment goals.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your specific circumstances.
