I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that if you're experiencing liver issues, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. General treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: These involve adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol and drugs that can harm the liver.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues (e.g., antiviral medications for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help monitor the health of your liver over time.

4. **Surgery**: In more severe cases, surgical options like liver transplantation may be necessary.

5. **Nutritional Support**: Consult with a nutritionist for a diet plan that supports liver health.

Always seek medical advice tailored to your specific condition.
