Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Plans:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out your contributions if you’re in a higher tax bracket.

### 2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Good for tax-deferred growth. Consider contributing to this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future, prioritize this option.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts allow for easy access to funds without penalties. They're essential for short-term goals.
   - **Investment Options:** You can choose a broader range of investments compared to retirement accounts, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### **General Strategy:**
- **Full Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **Max Contribution Limits:** After securing the match, prioritize maxing out your IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional, depending on your tax situation).
- **Taxable Account for Flexibility:** Allocate additional funds to a taxable account for short-term needs or as a complement for long-term savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### **Ongoing Assessment:**
- Regularly review and adjust contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and your financial needs.
- Diversify your investments across these accounts to balance risks and returns.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
