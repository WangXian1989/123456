To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and IRA): Contributions reduce your taxable income now, and you pay taxes upon withdrawal during retirement. Allocate higher-risk investments here for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains. Consider holding tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxes.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Rebalance Portfolio**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for each account type to maximize your savings without exceeding IRS regulations.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. A commonly recommended strategy is to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about your choices, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation, goals, and tax position.

By balancing these strategies, you can create an efficient investment approach tailored to your long-term financial objectives.
