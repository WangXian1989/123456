(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Generally, here are some strategies you can consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, if your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After getting the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, as these accounts offer tax advantages either upfront (traditional IRA) or on withdrawals (Roth IRA).

3. **Diversify Investment Types**: Within each account type, ensure a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeframe.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Funds in a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals. In taxable accounts, you'll owe taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Review Before Retirement**: As retirement approaches, you might want to consider shifting investments to minimize risk and prepare for withdrawals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a plan specific to your situation.

1. **Snatch Up That Company Match**: If your employer's throwing money at you for your 401(k), grab it! Itâ€™s literally free cash and a no-brainer to get that full match before you do anything else.

2. **IRA Creds**: Next on the to-do list is your IRA. If youâ€™re going traditional, great! Youâ€™re deferring tax payments until you withdraw. If you're eyeing a Roth, youâ€™ll want that tax-free action in retirement. Personal preference, baby!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any investments you want to keep liquid. Be careful with taxes; youâ€™re gonna get hit on any gains and income. So consider using these accounts for investments that generate less taxable income, like ETFs or long-term growth stocks.

4. **Keep It Funky but Balanced**: Mix up your asset allocation across all accounts. Donâ€™t just go all-in on one type of investment; diversification is key! 

5. **Yearly Check-Up**: As you near retirement, keep an eye on your investments and adjust your strategies to reduce risk. Gotta make that money work for you when you're chilling on the beach later!

Bottom line: Consult a financial guru if you're feeling lostâ€”better safe than sorry!
