Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals. Focus on this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later, prioritize the Roth IRA for its tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals since you'll pay capital gains tax on profits. Consider holding investments that are more tax-efficient here, like index funds or ETFs.

3. **Investment Strategies**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Allocate based on your risk tolerance—stocks for growth, bonds for stability. Typically, higher-risk investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep your asset allocation in check by rebalancing your portfolio as you approach retirement or as market conditions change.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months' expenses) in a savings account for liquidity.

5. **Long-term Goals**: Align your allocation with your investment horizon. Longer-term goals can take on more risk.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice considering your unique financial situation can provide more tailored strategies.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes your investment growth while managing risk and tax liability.
