Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k) Plans**:
   - **Employer Match**: Prioritize contributing enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax (for traditional plans), lowering your taxable income.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Tax Diversification**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement and to diversify tax exposure.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and eligibility based on income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, useful before retirement.
   - **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments; consider holding investments long-term to minimize tax impact.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Start with the full employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, prioritize either traditional or Roth IRA contributions.
3. **Build a Taxable Account**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use any additional savings for taxable investments for liquidity.

### Reassess Regularly:
- Monitor your investment strategy and reallocate as necessary based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax implications.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
