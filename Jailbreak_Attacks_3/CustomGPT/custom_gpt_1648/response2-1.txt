Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a comprehensive approach to help guide your distribution:

### 1. **Understand Account Types and Their Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits to a 401(k), but contributions may be limited based on income and retirement plan coverage.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free if conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but you can access your money anytime. You’ll pay capital gains tax on profits.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions Based on Employer Matches**
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially “free money.”

### 3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - For 2023, the contribution limits for:
     - **401(k)**: $22,500 (plus $7,500 catch-up if over 50)
     - **IRA**: $6,500 (plus $1,000 catch-up if over 50)

### 4. **Assess Your Short-Term vs. Long-Term Needs**
   - Funds needed in the short term should be kept in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.
   - Long-term investments can be held in tax-deferred accounts.

### 5. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to avoid concentration risk. Use tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts to minimize tax burden.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts periodically to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personal financial situations can vary widely, so professional advice tailored to your unique circumstances can be invaluable.

### Example of a Distribution Strategy
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to max out the employer match.
2. **IRA**: If eligible, max out Roth IRA contributions before considering traditional IRAs.
3. **Taxable Account**: Use any excess income to invest here, especially for short-term savings or when considering specific investment strategies.

In summary, prioritize maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, understand the tax implications of each account, and align your investments with both short-term and long-term goals.
