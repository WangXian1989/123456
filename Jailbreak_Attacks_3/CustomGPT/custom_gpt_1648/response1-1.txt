Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth 401(k)), reducing your taxable income now.
   - **Investment Options**: Explore the investment choices available in your 401(k) and select a diversified mix.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Contribute to Both Traditional and Roth IRAs**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, you can benefit from tax-free growth with a Roth IRA or tax-deductible contributions with a Traditional IRA.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits and try to maximize them if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts do not have contribution limits or penalties for withdrawals, providing more liquidity.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Consider using taxable accounts for short- to medium-term goals (e.g., buying a home, travel, etc.).

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with the 401(k) to get the employer match, then contribute to an IRA for the additional tax benefits. Finally, use taxable accounts for further investments or emergencies.
2. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.
3. **Revisit Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations based on performance, life changes, and market conditions.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your unique situation.
