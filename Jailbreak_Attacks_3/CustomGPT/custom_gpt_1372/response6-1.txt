To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Tax Efficiency:
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Start by maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 2. Asset Allocation:
   - **401(k):** Focus on growth-oriented investments since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA:** Depending on whether itâ€™s a traditional or Roth IRA, you can choose a mix of tax-exempt growth (Roth) or tax-deferred (traditional).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in income-generating assets (like bonds) to balance the tax impact.

### 3. Withdrawal Strategy:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically based on the tax implications. Typically, withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 4. Rebalance Regularly:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in tax laws.

Implementing these strategies will create a more tax-efficient portfolio and help you grow your investments effectively over time.
