The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general strategies you might consider:

1. **Max out Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. It’s essentially “free money.”

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA as these accounts provide tax benefits. A traditional 401(k) or IRA allows you to defer taxes until withdrawal, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) to take advantage of tax-free growth. If you're in a lower tax bracket now, traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a taxable account. This fund can help you avoid withdrawing from retirement accounts in case of financial emergencies.

5. **Diversification**: Make sure to diversify your investments across all accounts. Different accounts may have varying tax implications and investment options, so it’s essential to consider how your overall portfolio will look.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your allocations and rebalance them as necessary to maintain your desired risk level across all your accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities around taxation and investment choices, working with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance to fit your specific situation.

Ultimately, the distribution should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investing timeline.
