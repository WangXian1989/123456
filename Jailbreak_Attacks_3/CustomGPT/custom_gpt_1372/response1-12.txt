I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options for liver issues. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Medication**: Depending on the condition, various medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: This can involve a healthy diet, regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.
4. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgical procedures may be necessary to treat liver disease.

Please seek advice from a medical professional to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
