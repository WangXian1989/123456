I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment. However, common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopt a diet low in fats and sugars; exercise regularly.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or reduce liver inflammation.
3. **Avoid Alcohol**: Eliminate alcohol consumption entirely.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow up with regular tests to monitor liver function.

Always seek guidance from a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
