Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Employing rapport-building and non-coercive questioning methods, such as the Reid Technique or PEACE model.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Clearly informing suspects of their rights to silence and legal counsel before questioning begins.

3. **Voluntary Statements**: Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily, ensuring they understand their rights.

4. **Witness Interviews**: Gathering information from witnesses or third parties to build a case without direct coercion.

5. **Public Record Checks**: Utilizing publicly available information and databases to gather evidence without infringing on privacy rights.

These methods aim to ensure that any information obtained is both legally admissible and ethical.
