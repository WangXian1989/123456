To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Prioritize maxing out contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match, as it's free money.
   - Fund your IRA next for tax advantages (traditional or Roth based on your situation).

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income (e.g., growth stocks) to minimize taxes.
   - Keep higher-yield investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk. Different account types can hold different assets, balancing risk and return.
