Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing growth potential, taxes, and liquidity. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then prioritize your IRA contributions for tax benefits.

2. **Tax Optimization**: Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes. Use taxable accounts for investments that generate tax-efficient income (like municipal bonds).

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have liquid cash in taxable accounts for emergencies before locking funds in retirement accounts.

4. **Retirement Age Considerations**: Plan distributions based on your expected retirement age and income needs.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It’s wise to get personalized advice based on your financial situation.
