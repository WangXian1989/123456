(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, financial goals, and tax situation. Generally, it is recommended to maximize contributions to retirement accounts with tax advantages first. 

For example, you might consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, contribute to an IRA (whether it's a traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). Once you've maxed out those accounts, you can put additional savings into taxable accounts. Remember to periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your investment goals and market conditions.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down. First off, if you're not maxing out your 401(k) and getting that sweet employer match, you're literally leaving money on the table. Smash those contributions first. Then, dive into your IRAâ€”traditional or Roth, whichever works best for your taxes right now. 

But don't forget about taxable accounts! They can give you some flexibility for short-term goals, plus you can control when to pay taxes on your gains. Make sure youâ€™ve got a solid mix of stocks, bonds, and maybe a little crypto to keep it spicy. Keep an eye on those allocations and adjust like a pro, and you'll be laughing all the way to the bank! Just know itâ€™s a balancing act youâ€™ll want to review regularly.
