The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA, either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may offer current tax deductions.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After fully funding your IRA, return to your 401(k) and increase your contributions, ideally to the maximum allowed.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you still have additional funds to invest after maxing out retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and investments but may be subject to capital gains tax.

5. **Consider Investment Types**: In your taxable accounts, consider placing investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations regularly based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals.

If you have specific financial goals or tax situations, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
