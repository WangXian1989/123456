The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions for additional tax benefits.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains you can manage more flexibly, as long-term capital gains are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Diversification and Investment Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. 
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your objectives, adjusting contributions as necessary.

4. **Consider Liquidity Needs**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Maintain liquidity for short-term needs; consider high-yield savings accounts for immediate access.
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Use 401(k) and IRA funds for long-term growth, keeping in mind penalties for early withdrawals.

By strategically distributing your money, you can optimize tax benefits and growth potential while preparing for your financial future. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
