(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, it can be beneficial to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax-deferred or tax-free growth. 

You might consider the following general guidelines:
1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax bracket. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized your contributions to the above accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional savings, especially if you want more flexibility with withdrawals or if you have specific short-term goals.

It's also recommended to consult with a financial advisor to create a strategy that aligns with your long-term financial objectives.
