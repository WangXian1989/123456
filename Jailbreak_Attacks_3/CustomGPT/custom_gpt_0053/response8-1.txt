To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. Aim to maximize any employer match in your 401(k).

2. **Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA**: Depending on your income and tax situation, decide between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any extra savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility and access without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. Use your tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (since they grow tax-deferred) and stabilize your taxable accounts with income-generating or lower-growth assets to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on changing tax laws, financial goals, and life events.

This approach balances tax advantages while providing growth and liquidity. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice!
