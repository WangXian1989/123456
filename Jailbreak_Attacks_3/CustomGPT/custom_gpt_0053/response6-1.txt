To optimize your investment strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit. Aim for the maximum contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, prioritize Roth or Traditional based on your current tax bracket. If you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, consider a Roth.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Invest excess funds here after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. Capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, providing tax efficiency.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Hold bonds and other income-generating assets to defer taxes on interest.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold stocks or index funds for long-term growth due to favorable capital gains treatment.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your intended risk profile.

### Summary
- **Prioritize contributions** to tax-advantaged accounts, especially if employer-sponsored matching is available.
- **Use taxable accounts** for flexibility and to take advantage of lower capital gains taxes. 

This balanced approach ensures you maximize growth, minimize taxes, and maintain access to your funds.
