Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching. Focus on tax-deferred growth and invest in a diversified mix of assets based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. For a traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, promoting tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with lower expected tax liabilities, like index funds or ETFs. They're useful for short- to medium-term goals since youâ€™ll have more flexibility with withdrawals.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### General Tips:

- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your asset allocation as needed based on performance and market conditions.
- **Consider Fees**: Keep an eye on investment fees in each account type.
  
### Example Distribution:

- **401(k)**: 20%
- **IRA**: 15%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 65%

Adjust percentages based on your financial goals and life stage.
