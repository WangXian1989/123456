To optimally distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - Define your retirement goals (age, lifestyle, etc.).
   - Determine your risk tolerance.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k) and IRAs:** Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you donâ€™t pay taxes until withdrawal. This is beneficial for high-income years, allowing tax savings now.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains taxes. Use for savings goals that are shorter-term or to maintain flexibility.

### 3. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Max out any employer match in your 401(k) first for "free money."
   - Contribute the maximum to your IRA for tax advantages.
   - After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k):** Focus on a mix of stocks and bonds aligning with your risk profile.
   - **IRA:** Often requires more diversified investments (e.g., ETFs, mutual funds).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider more tax-efficient investments like index funds or tax-managed funds to minimize taxable income.

### 5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice, especially regarding tax implications based on your specific situation.
