Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Take advantage of any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - Focus on contributing enough to get the maximum match before distributing additional funds elsewhere.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider prioritizing it for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - A Traditional IRA can be beneficial for immediate tax deductions; prioritize it if you’re currently in a high tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you might need in the short term or for investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or long-term investments that qualify for capital gains tax benefits.
   - Remember that you may face capital gains taxes in the future when you sell investments in these accounts. 

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Max out your 401(k) match**.
2. **Contribute to your Roth IRA** (up to the limit).
3. **Invest in your taxable account** as you build your wealth, focusing on long-term growth investments.
4. **Continue adding to your 401(k)** and consider putting extra funds into a Traditional IRA if you have the ability.

### Regular Review:
- Regularly assess your investments and tax situation. Adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your unique situation.
