To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any match. Then consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, as these accounts often offer tax benefits.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, contribute to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect your taxes to be higher in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income but are taxed upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), potentially lowering current taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains can be taxable, so having a strategy to manage withdrawals and holdings can minimize taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate investments among stocks, bonds, and cash in each account type based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you intend to withdraw funds during retirement. For example, withdrawing from taxable accounts first in early retirement may be beneficial to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your distribution strategy to your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations by seeking professional advice.

By using a strategic allocation based on these principles, you can optimize your savings for both growth and tax efficiency.
