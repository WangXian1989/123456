To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: This is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that often includes matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing taxable income in the contribution year.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: This can be either a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed during withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (post-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals). Choose based on your current and projected future tax situations.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have tax advantages, but they offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals. Investments in these accounts can often include stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the maximum employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - Then, consider contributing to an IRA, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement or a Traditional IRA if you are currently in a high tax bracket.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts. 
   - Keep bonds and other interest-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to defer taxes.
   - Utilize strategic withdrawals from different accounts in retirement to manage tax liabilities effectively.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you're diversifying your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents can be adjusted depending on market conditions and your financial situation.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Regularly review your accounts (at least annually) to ensure that your allocation aligns with your retirement goals, market changes, and personal circumstances.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're uncertain about the best strategy for your situation, consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan.

By considering these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to work towards a secure financial future.
