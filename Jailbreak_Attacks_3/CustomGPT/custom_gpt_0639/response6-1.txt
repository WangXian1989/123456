When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to assess your financial goals, investment timeline, and tax implications. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. Understand the Account Types
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with match contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, and taxes are incurred upon withdrawal.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax-deferred growth. Traditional IRAs have pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, given certain conditions.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax when investments are sold for a profit. There are no tax advantages, but you can access your funds without penalties.

### 2. Consider Your Goals and Timeline
- If your goal is retirement and you have a long time horizon, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
- Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing funds before retirement.

### 3. Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to obtain the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
- **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, maximize contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth), especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use any remaining funds for a taxable account, focusing on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impacts.

### 4. Review Regularly
- Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and investment performance.
- Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

By balancing contributions across these accounts, you can leverage tax advantages, ensure long-term growth, and maintain accessibility to your funds when needed.
