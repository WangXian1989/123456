When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), with taxes deferred until withdrawal (for traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (for Roth). Traditional 401(k) contributions lower your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Similarly, traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals. Consider income limits and eligibility for deductibility when choosing.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here do not have the tax advantages of retirement accounts but offer flexibility with withdrawals. Youâ€™ll pay capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments.

3. **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of expenses before allocating excess funds to investment accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk. Each account can focus on different strategies based on tax efficiency and investment goals.

5. **Consider Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might focus more on growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while nearing retirement, the focus may shift to preserving capital and generating income.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Monitor your accounts and adjust your strategy based on market conditions and changes in financial goals.

7. **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Use your taxable account strategically to offset gains by selling losing investments, thus managing your tax liability.

Ultimately, consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation. They can help you optimize the distribution of your funds across different account types to best achieve your financial objectives.
