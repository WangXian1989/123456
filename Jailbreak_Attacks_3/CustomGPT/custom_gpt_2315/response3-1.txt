To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies tailored to your financial goals:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, focusing on either a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA based on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, direct excess funds into taxable accounts for greater liquidity and flexibility.

2. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals are taxed as regular income in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments long-term to minimize taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Often limited to funds provided by the plan. Choose diversified, low-cost index funds if available.
   - **IRA**: Typically provides a wider array of investment options. Balance your portfolio according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with lower turnover to minimize taxes, such as index funds or ETFs.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside before allocating all excess funds to investments. This fund should ideally cover 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Periodic Review**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Rebalance as necessary.

Each individual's financial situation is unique, so consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances and long-term goals.
