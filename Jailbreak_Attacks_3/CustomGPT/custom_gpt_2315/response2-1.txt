The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), ensure you're contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing a percentage of your income to your 401(k). This account grows tax-deferred, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.

3. **IRA Contributions:** If you're eligible, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) after your 401(k). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions for contributions.

4. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account or money market account to cover 3-6 months of living expenses before investing aggressively.

5. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maximized contributions to your retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. They provide more flexibility and can be advantageous for long-term capital gains tax rates.

6. **Diversification:** Within each account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

7. **Review Regularly:** Assess your financial situation and retirement goals regularly. Adjust your contributions and allocations as needed based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement timelines.

8. **Consult a Professional:** It may be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your retirement goals and financial future.
