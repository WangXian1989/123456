Certainly! Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize employer match on 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match before directing any additional funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Once you've taken full advantage of your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation and retirement goals. The IRA can provide different tax advantages that can benefit your overall retirement savings.

3. **Continue funding 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA contributions, go back to your 401(k) and continue contributing, especially if you have not reached the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable accounts for flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maximizing your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide more liquidity and flexibility, especially for mid-term goals or if you want easier access to your funds for investments not bound by retirement rules.

5. **Rebalance regularly**: Make sure to monitor and rebalance your investments periodically to stay in line with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consider tax implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type. For instance, 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed on withdrawals, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals under certain conditions.

It's recommended to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.
