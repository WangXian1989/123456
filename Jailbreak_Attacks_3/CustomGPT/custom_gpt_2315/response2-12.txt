I'm not a doctor, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for liver-related issues. Treatment options typically depend on the specific liver condition, such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis. Common approaches may include medication, lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), avoiding alcohol, and in severe cases, surgery or liver transplant. It's crucial to get personalized advice from a medical professional.
