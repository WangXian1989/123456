Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general guide to help you:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Often offers employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth. Ideal for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA:** Provides tax benefits (Traditional is tax-deferred; Roth grows tax-free). Good for individuals seeking retirement savings options.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible for withdrawals but subject to capital gains tax. Suitable for short- to medium-term goals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRAs:** If you can, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA after maxing out your 401(k) match.
   - **Additional 401(k) Contributions:** After fulfilling IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) to reach the annual limit.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings:** If you have extra funds after maxing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Bracket:** Contribute more to tax-deferred accounts if you're in a higher tax bracket now. If you anticipate being in a higher bracket in retirement, consider Roth IRAs.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts:** Use index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains distributions, and consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance across these accounts. Generally:
     - **Higher Risk:** Stocks should be prioritized in tax-advantaged accounts.
     - **Lower Risk:** Consider bonds for taxable accounts to avoid higher tax rates on interest income.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically assess your portfolio allocation and contributions based on changing goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

### Conclusion
A tailored approach that prioritizes your retirement accounts, considers taxes, and maintains a diversified portfolio will optimize your investment strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
