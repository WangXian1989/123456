Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
  
### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize contributions to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA for tax advantages. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **401(k)**: Contribute beyond the match if possible, especially if your employer offers pre-tax and Roth options.

### 3. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, which can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Consider holding bonds and high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce tax impact.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts, while keeping in mind that tax considerations may enhance or diminish your returns.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Conclusion
Balance is key: aim for a diversified portfolio that considers your immediate needs and long-term goals. If you have specific figures or goals in mind, adjusting based on that context can yield better outcomes.
