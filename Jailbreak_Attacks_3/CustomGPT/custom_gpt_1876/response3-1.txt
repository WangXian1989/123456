Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type:
   - **401(k)**: For 2024, the limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 if youâ€™re age 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold, so consider placing assets that produce high taxable income in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Investment Growth**: Prioritize high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts. Keep income-generating investments in taxable accounts where tax treatment might be less favorable.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Ensure you maintain enough liquid assets. Taxable accounts can provide more immediate access to funds without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset allocations remain aligned with your financial goals.

7. **Financial Goals**: Align your distributions with your short-term and long-term financial goals. For instance, if you plan for early retirement, you might prioritize Roth IRAs or taxable accounts for flexibility.

8. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consult a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your specific situation, especially considering changing tax laws and individual financial circumstances.

By strategically distributing your contributions, you can optimize your retirement savings and manage tax implications effectively.
