Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before investing in other accounts. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The choice depends on whether you prefer tax deductions now (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth).

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can allocate additional savings to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility, but you’ll pay capital gains tax on investments sold for a profit.

3. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Long-term investments (like stocks) may be more suitable for tax-advantaged accounts, while safer investments (like bonds) may be better in taxable accounts.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

4. **Rebalance and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and retirement goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider professional advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

This strategy aims to maximize savings and minimize tax impact while ensuring you meet your retirement goals.
