Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money".
   - **IRA**: Aim to maximize annual contributions if eligible. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you meet the income limits.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: These are great for high-income years as contributions reduce taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement may be taxed at a lower rate.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short-term goals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell investments.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stocks may be better for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds may be more suitable for taxable accounts due to their interest income being taxed at your ordinary income rate.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize taxes. For example, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Reevaluate your asset allocation periodically and adjust as needed to stay aligned with your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It may be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your unique circumstances.

This approach can help you optimize your retirement savings while managing your tax liabilities effectively.
