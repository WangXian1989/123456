Distributing your money wisely among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is key to effective financial planning. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to get the full employer match, if availableâ€”it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income, and investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Investment Choices**: Check the investment options available, as they can vary significantly from one plan to another.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Flexibility**: Depending on your income, choose between a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits and consider fully funding your IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match.
   - **Investment Control**: IRAs often provide a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k) plans.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts offer flexibility for short-term needs or goals; they can be accessed without penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be aware of capital gains taxes when buying and selling investments. Favor tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax burdens.
   - **Diversification**: Use taxable accounts to diversify your investment strategy and hold assets that may generate lower taxable income, like municipal bonds.

### General Strategy:
1. **Maximize Employer Matching Contributions**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the maximum match.
2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA contributions, focusing on the benefits of tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
3. **Fill Taxable Accounts**: Finally, allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and additional investment options.

It's essential to regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
