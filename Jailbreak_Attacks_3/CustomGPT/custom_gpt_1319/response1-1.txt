To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be more beneficial for the initial tax deduction.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds), as they incur fewer capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Hold investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in your 401(k) and IRA to defer taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Keep growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable income-producing assets in taxable accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and market conditions.
