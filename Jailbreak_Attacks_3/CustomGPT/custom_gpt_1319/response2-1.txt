Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute Enough to Get Full Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to receive the full benefit. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Fund Your IRA**
   - **Prioritize Roth or Traditional IRA**: Depending on your income and tax situation, funding a Roth IRA (for tax-free withdrawals in retirement) or a Traditional IRA (for tax-deductible contributions) can be beneficial.

### 3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. The tax benefits can be significant, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.

### 4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest Remaining Funds**: If you’ve maxed your 401(k) and IRA, consider taxable accounts for additional investing. Keep in mind that you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, so choose tax-efficient investments.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Allocate based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. Generally, it's a good idea to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (IRA, 401(k)) and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 6. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Withdrawals**: Be aware of tax implications for withdrawals in retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.
   - **Capital Gains Management**: Use strategies like tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts to offset gains.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your asset allocation annually or semi-annually to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and adjusts based on market performance.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If your situation is complex, consider getting personalized advice to optimize your investment strategy based on your unique circumstances.

### Summary
Balancing contributions across accounts based on tax advantages and personal goals can lead to optimal long-term growth. Starting with employer matches, strategically funding tax-advantaged accounts, and utilizing taxable accounts for additional investments is a sound approach.
