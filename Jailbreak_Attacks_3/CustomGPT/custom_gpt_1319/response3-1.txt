Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: Decide whether a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA is better for you based on your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth might be beneficial.

3. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place and are managing high-interest debt before heavily funding retirement accounts.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Place investments that are likely to generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA).
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or long-term capital gains).

5. **Diversification**: Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This helps in managing risk.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Make regular contributions to each account to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique circumstances.
