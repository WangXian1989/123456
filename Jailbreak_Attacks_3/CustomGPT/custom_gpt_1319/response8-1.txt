Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investment flexibility. They can be useful for short-term goals or as an emergency fund.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Prioritize accounts based on your current and expected future tax rates. For example, if you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments in each account are diversified, minimizing risk across assets and account types.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust allocations based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your life circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help you create a strategy tailored to your specific situation.

Remember to reassess your allocation periodically as your financial goals and circumstances change.
