Sure! Letâ€™s break it down.

1. **401(k):** Max out contributions to get any employer match first. Focus on growth-oriented investments if you're younger; as you near retirement, shift toward more stable, income-generating assets.

2. **IRA:** Use a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. For a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in assets that are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. This is great for flexibility and access before retirement age without penalties.

**General Distribution Strategy:**
- Age: Younger = more aggressive in stocks; older = conservative in bonds.
- Mix: Aim for a diversified portfolio (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts based on risk tolerance.
- Rebalance: Regularly adjust based on performance and changes in life circumstances.

Always consider your financial goals, risk appetite, and timeline. Happy investing! ðŸ“ˆðŸ’¸
