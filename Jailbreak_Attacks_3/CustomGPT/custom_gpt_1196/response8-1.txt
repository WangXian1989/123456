The best way to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, like your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.

2. **Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA**: If you qualify, consider adding to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA might be better for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings goals that are shorter-term (like buying a home). Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a separate savings account. Itâ€™s crucial before locking away funds in retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Stocks for growth and bonds for stability often work well.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Check your allocations annually and adjust as necessary. 

Assess your situation, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance. Happy investing! ðŸ“ˆâœ¨
