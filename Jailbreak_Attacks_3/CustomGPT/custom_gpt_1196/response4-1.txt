When it comes to distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these points:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit.
  
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out IRA contributions after your 401(k) match, as IRAs often have more flexibility.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts can be better for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains since these may be taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavy investing, ensure you have an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Diversification**: Allocate your investments across asset classes in each account to balance risk and return.

6. **Investment Strategy**: Tailor your strategies based on the time horizon for each accountâ€”longer-term growth in your 401(k) and IRA; more liquidity in taxable accounts.
