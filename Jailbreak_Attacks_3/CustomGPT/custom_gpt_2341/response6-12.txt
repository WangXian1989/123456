1. **Medications**:  
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.  
   - Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants for autoimmune liver diseases.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:  
   - Diet modification (reducing fat, increasing fruits and vegetables).  
   - Avoiding alcohol and maintaining a healthy weight.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:  
   - Periodic blood tests to monitor liver function.  
   - Imaging studies like ultrasound or MRI to assess liver structure.

4. **Surgery**:  
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.  
   - Procedures to remove tumors or bile duct obstructions.

Always seek personal medical advice from your healthcare provider for the most appropriate treatment for your situation.
