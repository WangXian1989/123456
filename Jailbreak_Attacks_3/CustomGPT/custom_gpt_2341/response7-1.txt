Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Plans**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to maximize this benefit first. This is essentially free money. Then, consider the investment options available in the plan, factoring in fees and performance.

2. **IRA Accounts**: Max out your IRA contributions if possible. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After contributing to your retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts provide flexibility, as you can withdraw funds without penalties. Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that you're using tax-advantaged accounts for assets that will benefit from tax deferral (like bonds) and keep stocks in taxable accounts when possible to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.
   
5. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, or your investment goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.
