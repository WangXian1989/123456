Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and income eligibility.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions:** If you can still contribute after the IRA, go back to maxing out your 401(k) contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** If you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, then it’s time to invest in taxable accounts. This is suitable for both short-term and long-term investments.

5. **Consider Tax Implications:** Keep in mind the tax implications for withdrawal strategies and how long you’ll keep the investments.

6. **Diversify Investments:** Ensure that you have a balanced and diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.
