Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and tax strategy. Here are some considerations to guide your decision:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get any available employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Consider whether a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals in retirement) or a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth with taxable withdrawals) aligns better with your future tax expectations.
   - **Increased Flexibility:** Roth IRAs do not have required minimum distributions (RMDs), allowing for more control over your funds.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Strategic Tax Management:** Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate less taxable income (like index funds) and hold bonds or high-yield assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts.
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility:** Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.

### **Overall Strategy**
- **Diversification:** Maintain a mix of asset types across all accounts to spread risk effectively.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically assess your asset allocation and make adjustments based on performance and changing goals.

By taking these considerations into account, you can create a distribution strategy that aligns with your long-term financial objectives while optimizing tax implications.
