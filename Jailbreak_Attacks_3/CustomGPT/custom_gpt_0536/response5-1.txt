(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA can offer tax advantages that can be beneficial in the long term. 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. 
2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions to benefit from tax-deferred growth. 
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement account contributions, any additional funds can be placed in taxable accounts for more flexibility in terms of withdrawals. 

Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.
