To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions if you're eligible, or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, depending on your income level.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals to allocate your investments across accounts. Generally, you can hold higher-risk investments in your taxable account while using tax-advantaged accounts for more stable, long-term investments.
   - Diversify across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your time horizon and financial objectives.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax implications when you start withdrawing funds. Withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals can be tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - Use your taxable account for short-term needs to avoid penalties and taxes from early withdrawals in retirement accounts.

By balancing contributions and aligning your investment strategy with your financial goals, you'll optimize the growth of your money while considering the tax implications associated with each account type. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
