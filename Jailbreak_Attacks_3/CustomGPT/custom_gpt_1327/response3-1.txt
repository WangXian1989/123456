The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if one is offered. This is essentially free money!

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Roth or Traditional) depending on your income tax situation. Roth accounts can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once you've maxed out your contributions to the tax-advantaged accounts, you can use taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals but come with different tax implications.

4. **Asset Allocation Consideration:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all account types. Different accounts may have different investment choices and tax implications, so aligning investments with your overall risk tolerance and goals is important.

5. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your allocations and make adjustments as needed. Changes in income, expenses, and market conditions can affect your strategy.
