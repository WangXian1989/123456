When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a concise approach to help you maximize your investment:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Contribute to your 401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially "free money."
   - **Maximize IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider funding a Roth or traditional IRA for potential tax benefits.

2. **Balance Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity, especially if you anticipate needing funds before retirement.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds and municipal bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, diversify with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to balance risk and return.
   - Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Putting these strategies into action while considering your unique situation can help you effectively manage your investment distributions. Feel free to ask if you'd like more detailed insights or tips on this! ðŸ˜Š
