When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's all about balancing your long-term growth goals, tax implications, and liquidity needs. Here are some tips to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money! Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if possible. 

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Investments in a 401(k) and traditional IRA grow tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t owe taxes until you withdraw the money. 
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance, diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account. Higher-risk investments are often better suited for tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.

4. **Liquidity Needs**: Keep in mind that funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties or restrictions, which is important for emergencies or short-term goals. 

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan ahead for when and how youâ€™ll withdraw money in retirement. Taxable accounts might be tapped first to avoid penalties on retirement accounts until necessary.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specifically to your financial situation. Remember, everyone's situation is a little different, so finding what works best for you is key! ðŸ˜Š
