It's great that you're thinking about how to distribute your money! The best strategy often depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. Here are some general tips for you:

1. **401(k) Contributions:** Max out your employer match first â€” that's free money! If you can contribute more after that, consider bumping up your contributions here, especially if you have a good selection of investment options.

2. **IRA Accounts:** Traditional IRAs give you tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on whether you want tax relief now or later. If youâ€™re eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** These are useful for flexibility and can be a good place for money you might need before retirement (like for a house or an emergency). Be mindful of taxes on capital gains here.

4. **Diversification:** Donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket! Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Rebalancing:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

It might be helpful to chat with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that suits your situation! How does that sound to you? ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’°
