Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations based on your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here’s a balanced approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**

- **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
- **IRA**: Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA after maxing out your 401(k) contributions, depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**

- **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Contributions are tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement.
- **Roth Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they are realized. Consider using these for short-term needs or after you max out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**

- **Long-Term Growth**: Consider allocating more aggressive investments (stocks, ETFs) in tax-deferred accounts to take advantage of the compounding growth without immediate tax consequences.
- **Income Generation**: Place income-generating investments (bonds, REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts where interest and dividends won’t be taxed annually.
- **Tax Efficiency**: In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments to minimize tax burdens (e.g., index funds, municipal bonds).

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Debt Management**

- Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing. Pay off high-interest debts, which can often save more money than investments can earn.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**

- Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, job status, tax laws, and retirement goals. Rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired risk profile.

### Example Distribution Strategy

1. **Max 401(k) up to the employer match**.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** based on what is more beneficial for your tax situation (Traditional vs. Roth).
3. **Any additional funds** can go into a taxable account, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Final Thoughts

Consult a financial advisor for a personalized strategy that fits your specific situation and goals. They can help you navigate the complexities of tax laws and investment options.
