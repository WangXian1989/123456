Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you can, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a separate savings account before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance. Younger investors might lean more towards stocks for higher growth potential.
   - **IRA**: Similar to your 401(k), but you might have more flexible investment options. Consider diversifying across different asset classes.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that provide favorable tax treatment, like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs. Be mindful of capital gains tax.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income or long-term capital gains.

5. **Review Regularly**: 
   - Regularly reassess your portfolio and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
