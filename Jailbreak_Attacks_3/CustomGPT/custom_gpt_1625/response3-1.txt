When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Make sure to contribute enough to achieve any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether itâ€™s a Traditional or Roth IRA, the tax benefits will differ. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and short-term capital gains are taxed at your ordinary income rate, while long-term capital gains have a lower tax rate. Use these accounts for investments that may generate significant short-term gains or dividends.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Align your investment choices with your goals. For retirement savings, a more aggressive strategy might be appropriate in your 401(k) and IRA since they have long-term time horizons. 
   - For taxable accounts, consider more conservative investments with lower volatility and tax efficiency, such as index funds.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account type. Max out your 401(k) employer match and consider maxing out your IRA if you can.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify within accounts as well as across them. Investments in your 401(k) might differ from those in your IRA or taxable accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions, making adjustments as needed based on market conditions, changes in your financial situation, and retirement goals.

By maintaining a balanced approach and considering the tax implications, you can optimize the distribution of your funds across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
