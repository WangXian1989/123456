I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver health. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment options. 

Common treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle changes**: This includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight. 
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe antiviral drugs, corticosteroids, or other specific medications. 
3. **Avoiding alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake can significantly help improve liver health.
4. **Regular monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging can help monitor liver function and disease progression.
5. **Surgery or procedures**: In severe cases, liver transplant or other surgical interventions might be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
