Distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Contributions Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: Can contribute up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50) for 2024.
   - **IRA**: Maximum contribution is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) for 2024.
   
2. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax; taxes are owed upon withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to 401(k) with possible tax deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money; withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxed as realized gains; can be more flexible but subject to capital gains tax.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Prioritize maximizing employer match in your 401(k) if available, as it's essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out Roth IRA contributions for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Use taxable accounts for more flexible access or specific investment goals.

4. **Time Horizon**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for potential long-term growth.
   - Use conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for withdrawals based on tax implications. For example, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

A well-rounded approach typically involves contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the match, maxing out an IRA (preferably a Roth if eligible), and then investing additional funds in taxable accounts based on your specific needs and goals. 

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation.
