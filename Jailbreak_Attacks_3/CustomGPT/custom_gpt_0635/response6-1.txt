To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **401(k):** Maximize contributions for tax-deferred growth. Focus on higher-risk assets here since you'll benefit from compounding without immediate tax implications.
   - **IRA:** Utilize a Roth IRA if eligible. After-tax contributions can grow tax-free, making it ideal for investments expected to appreciate significantly.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Keep lower-risk investments or those with dividends here, as you'll pay capital gains taxes on profits when sold. 

### 2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Equities:** Allocate more to stocks in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to leverage the potential for higher returns.
   - **Bonds:** Consider holding bonds in taxable accounts to manage taxes, as interest income is taxed at ordinary income rates.

### 3. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Assess and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider rebalance strategies that minimize tax impacts. 

By focusing on tax efficiency and appropriate asset allocation, you'll be better positioned to maximize your long-term growth while managing risks. Always consult with a financial advisor tailored to your individual circumstances for personalized advice.
