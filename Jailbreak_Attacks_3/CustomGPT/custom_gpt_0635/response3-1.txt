To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Your Tax Situation**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income is taxed in the year you realize it, so strategies here differ.

2. **Determine Your Goals**:
   - Define your short-term and long-term financial goals. This will influence how much you allocate to each account.

3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a separate emergency fund before investing heavily in these accounts.

4. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k) and IRA. Focus on tax-deferred accounts first for long-term savings.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - In tax-advantaged accounts, you can hold more actively managed funds or higher-yield investments that might create significant taxable events.

6. **Consider Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you’re younger with decades until retirement, a higher risk, equity-heavy portfolio might make sense, using tax-advantaged accounts for growth.
   - As you near retirement, shift towards more stable, income-producing investments.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly assess your investment allocations in all accounts, and rebalance to maintain your desired risk profile.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Complex financial situations can benefit from personalized advice. Consider speaking with a financial planner for tailored strategies.

By considering these factors, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize for growth and minimize taxes over time.
