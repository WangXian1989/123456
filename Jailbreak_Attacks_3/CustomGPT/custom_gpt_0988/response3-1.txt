Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Assess Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but taxes are paid upon withdrawal.

3. **Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment choices available in each account. Sometimes, 401(k)s have limited options compared to IRAs, which may offer a wider variety of investments.

4. **Diversify Among Accounts**: Consider diversifying across different types of accounts:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Use tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s for long-term investments.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Keep some investments in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**: Think about when and how you may need to access these funds:
   - If you plan to retire early, you'll need a strategy for accessing retirement accounts without penalties (like 72(t) distributions).

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your distribution strategy based on changes in your income, expenses, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring a strategy to your specific circumstances can be complex, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

By balancing contributions across these accounts based on your financial picture, you can optimize tax benefits and investment growth over time.
