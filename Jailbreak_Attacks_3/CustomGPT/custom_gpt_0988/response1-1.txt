Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be approached strategically based on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money. Consider maximizing your contributions up to the annual limit if you can afford it.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** After your 401(k) contributions, consider funding an IRA. Choose a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. Otherwise, a traditional IRA may be more beneficial for immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Once you’ve maxed out the 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider any additional investments in taxable accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes and the benefits of tax-loss harvesting.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, younger investors can afford higher risk (stocks) while those closer to retirement may prefer more stable investments (bonds).

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance. Rebalancing can help you manage risk and capitalize on market movements.

### 5. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**
   - The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative your investment strategy should be. Ensure your allocations shift towards more stable investments as needed.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice considering your unique circumstances, consulting a financial professional can provide tailored strategies that align with your goals.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 10-15% of your income (up to the employer match)
- **IRA:** Max out contributions (currently $6,500 annually, or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable accounts:** Any additional savings after maxing tax-advantaged accounts

### Final Thoughts
Adjust this strategy based on your specific financial landscape and goals. Starting with tax-advantaged accounts is usually the best bet, ensuring you're making the most of available tax benefits.
