To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts are tax-advantaged, meaning you can defer taxes on contributions and investment gains. Prioritize maxing out contributions to these accounts first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions in your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Since these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes on earnings, consider keeping less tax-efficient investments (e.g., actively managed funds) here.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **401(k)**: Great for retirement savings. Focus on a diversified portfolio aligned with your retirement age.
   - **IRA**: This can be a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions. Choose based on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for shorter-term goals or for flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out your contributions in tax-advantaged accounts before investing heavily in taxable accounts. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Determine a suitable asset allocation strategy (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. This strategy should be consistent across all accounts, but the type of assets can vary based on account type for tax efficiency.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for how and when you’ll access these funds, especially during retirement. Consider tax implications for withdrawals from each type of account.

In summary, prioritize maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, utilize taxable accounts for flexibility and short-term needs, and strategically allocate investments based on their tax implications. Consulting with a financial advisor can further tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
