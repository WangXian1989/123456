When planning how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before contributing to taxable accounts. These accounts grow tax-deferred (in the case of a traditional 401(k) or IRA) or tax-free (for Roth accounts).

3. **Income Needs**: Consider your immediate cash flow needs. If you expect to need funds in the short term, keep a portion in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

4. **Investment Strategies**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a company plan, invest in a diversified portfolio of index funds or target-date funds based on your retirement age.
   - **IRA**: Choose investments that complement your 401(k). You might consider a more aggressive approach here if youâ€™re younger and can afford to take more risk.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may produce short-term gains or need to be withdrawn for emergencies or goals before retirement, keeping in mind the tax implications.

5. **Tax implications**: Be strategic about your asset allocation. For example, holding bonds or higher-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts can be beneficial, while equities in taxable accounts might benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, personal goals, and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique financial situation and goals.
