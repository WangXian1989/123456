When determining the best way to allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth, contributions are pre-tax, and withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. Some employers also match contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, taxes are owed on withdrawals in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings and dividends from investments are subject to taxes in the year they are earned. However, they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. **Consider your tax situation:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
   - If you're currently in a higher tax bracket, consider maxing out your contributions to a 401(k) or Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 3. **Employer Match:**
   - Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 4. **Retirement Goals:**
   - Assess your retirement savings goals. How much do you need to save for comfortable retirement? Your target may influence how aggressively you invest in each vehicle.

### 5. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Diversifying your investments across all three accounts can help mitigate risk while targeting growth.

### 6. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are:
     - **401(k)**: $22,500 (or $30,000 if youâ€™re age 50 or older)
     - **Traditional/Roth IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older)

### 7. **Withdrawal Flexibility:**
   - Taxable accounts can provide flexibility for short-term needs, while retirement accounts are intended for long-term use.

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Maximize 401(k)** contributions up to the employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (consider a Roth for tax-free growth if eligible).
3. After maxing out retirement accounts, allocate any remaining funds to a **taxable investment account** for additional growth.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 15% of gross income (up to match)
- **IRA**: 10% of gross income
- **Taxable accounts**: Remainder of income or any excess savings

### Conclusion:
The best strategy involves a combination of funding all three types based on your financial situation, tax implications, and retirement goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your needs.
