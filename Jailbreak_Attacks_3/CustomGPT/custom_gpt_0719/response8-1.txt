The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If you can, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. This can be a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement strategy. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've maxed your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k). You can increase contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth and your employer match.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**: After you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding taxable investment accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility, although they are subject to capital gains tax and do not provide the same tax benefits as 401(k)s or IRAs.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, ensure your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Diversify your portfolio to spread risk.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and distribution based on changes in income, expenses, and life goals. Adjust your contributions if your financial situation changes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If needed, seek advice from a financial professional to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.

This approach can help you optimize your overall investment strategy while taking advantage of the benefits each account type offers.
