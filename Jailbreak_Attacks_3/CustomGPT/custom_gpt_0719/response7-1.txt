The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here’s a general approach based on common financial principles:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to obtain the full match first. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, but they provide more flexibility for withdrawals. It can be beneficial to keep investments that generate regular income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax exposure.

### 3. Diversify Investments:
   - Within each account type, diversify your portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. This could involve a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 4. Adjust Contributions Based on Life Stage:
   - As you approach retirement age, consider shifting more assets into safer investments in tax-deferred accounts to preserve your capital.

### 5. Regularly Reassess Your Strategy:
   - Life circumstances and economic factors change, so it’s crucial to review your investment strategy at least annually and adjust contributions as necessary.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
2. **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed based on eligibility (e.g., $6,000 for individuals under 50, $7,000 for those 50 and older).
3. **Taxable Account**: After maximizing tax-advantaged contributions, invest any additional savings here while keeping an eye on tax efficiency.

### Summary
By following these steps, you can effectively balance your contributions to each account type while maximizing tax advantages and preparing for your financial future.
