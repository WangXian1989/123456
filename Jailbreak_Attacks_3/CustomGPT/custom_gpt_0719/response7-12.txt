I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver health. The best treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition affecting your liver. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet low in saturated fats, sugars, and salt can help support liver health. Incorporating fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is beneficial.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight, which is important for liver health.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption can prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications**: Your doctor may prescribe medications to treat specific liver conditions, such as antivirals for hepatitis or medications to manage symptoms like itching or pain.

3. **Treatment of Underlying Conditions**: Addressing conditions that affect the liver, such as diabetes or high cholesterol, can also help improve liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track the progression of liver disease and adjust treatments as necessary.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases of liver disease, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
