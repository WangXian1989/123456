To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, leading to tax-deferred growth. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax benefits as 401(k)s, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax. Consider using these for more liquid assets or for short-term goals.

### 2. **Diversification**:
   - Allocate assets based on risk tolerance across all accounts. 
   - **Tax-efficient Investments**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher yielding investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Contribution Strategy**:
   - Max out employer matches in 401(k) first, then consider Roth IRA contributions (if eligible) for tax-free growth. 
   - Fund traditional IRAs next if seeking tax deductions, and any remainder can go into taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - Strategically manage withdrawals to remain in lower tax brackets.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review asset allocation and adjust based on market performance, life changes, and retirement goals.

By implementing these strategies, you can optimize tax efficiency and growth potential across all your investment accounts. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
