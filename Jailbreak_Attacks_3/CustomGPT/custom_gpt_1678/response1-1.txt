To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing this out if you have a strong employer match. Look at high-growth investments here.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth when you withdraw.

3. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on gains.
   - Keep lower-taxed income investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying across all accounts to spread risk and optimize returns.

5. **Stay Flexible**: Adjust contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor strategies to your financial situation and goals.

Evaluate your specific financial circumstances and goals, as individual needs can vary significantly.
