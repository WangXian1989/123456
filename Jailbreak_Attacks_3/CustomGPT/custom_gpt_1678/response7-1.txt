Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Utilize for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as they may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions and gains are tax-deferred or tax-free (in the case of a Roth), which can be beneficial for long-term growth.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Diversify your investments within these accounts (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk, but consider the overall allocation across all accounts.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep enough in your taxable account for short-term needs or emergencies, as withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties if taken before age 59½.

### 5. **Rebalance as Necessary**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and changing financial goals.

### Summary
Start by maxing out your 401(k) contributions, then fund an IRA, and finally allocate excess savings to taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility. Adjust your strategy based on tax considerations and your investment horizon. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
