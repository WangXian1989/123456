Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your savings and investment growth. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the 401(k) match, aim to max out contributions to your IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation) before returning to your 401(k) for additional contributions.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now and defers taxes until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deferral, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes on profits, so consider holding investments for longer to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that down before contributing heavily to these accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, consider holding more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency savings fund beyond these accounts, usually covering 3-6 months of expenses.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to align with your goals and risk tolerance.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation and goals.
