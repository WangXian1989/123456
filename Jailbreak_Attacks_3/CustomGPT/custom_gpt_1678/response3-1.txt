Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored with tax-deferred growth; often includes matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Offers tax advantages; contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional) or withdrawals tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax benefits but offer flexibility for withdrawals and can hold various investments.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRA:** Depending on your income and tax situation, consider contributing to an IRA next, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA.
   - **Additional to 401(k):** After maxing the IRA, increase your contributions to the 401(k) if you can afford it.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** Reduce taxable income now, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Pay taxes now, but enjoy tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Effective for short-term goals and more flexible but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Aggressive Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Consider higher-risk investments in 401(k) and IRAs since they are tax-deferred.
   - **Stable Growth in Taxable Accounts:** Focus on more stable, income-generating investments to manage taxes effectively.

### 5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly assess your contributions and rebalance your portfolio as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** 15% (up to match)
- **Roth/Traditional IRA:** 10%
- **Taxable Account:** Remaining funds (30%+)

### Key Takeaway:
Balance your short-term needs with long-term growth, taking full advantage of tax benefits and employer contributions to maximize your overall retirement savings.
