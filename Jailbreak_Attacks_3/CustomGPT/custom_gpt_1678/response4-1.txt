To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **401(k) Maximization**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Prioritize maxing out contributions if you're under 50 ($22,500 for 2024, plus $7,500 if over 50).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - If you prefer immediate tax benefits, focus on a traditional IRA. Aim for the annual limit ($6,500 for 2024, plus $1,000 if over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that may benefit from long-term capital gains rates (lower than regular income rates).
   - Diversify with tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Maximize tax-advantaged accounts for bonds or income-generating assets.
   - Use taxable accounts for growth-oriented investments, allowing them to accrue lower capital gains.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly reassess your allocation to maintain your desired risk level and accommodate changes in market conditions.

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement, then tax-deferred accounts, to minimize taxes over time.

7. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these investments.

Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies based on your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and long-term goals.
