Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if feasible.
- **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax burdens (e.g., index funds) or to hold cash for short-term needs. This helps manage potential capital gains taxes.

### 3. Consider Your Investment Horizon
- **Long-Term Growth**: Allocate more towards tax-advantaged accounts for growth, as they benefit from compounding without immediate tax implications.
- **Short-Term Needs**: Prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility in withdrawals.

### 4. Diversify Your Investments
- Keep a balanced approach across all accounts focusing on stocks, bonds, and alternative investments, adjusted for risk tolerance.

### Summary
- **Prioritize tax-advantaged contributions**.
- **Consider investment time frames** for allocation.
- **Diversify investments** across all account types.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.
