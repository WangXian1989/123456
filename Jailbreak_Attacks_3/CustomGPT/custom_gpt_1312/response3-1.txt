Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're over 50).

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxable in the year they're realized. Use this account for short-term goals or to hold investments that generate tax-efficient income.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing your more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., 401(k) and IRA) where growth is compounded tax-free.
   - Hold more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxable income.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, itâ€™s tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help optimize your strategy based on your unique financial situation.

Ultimately, your specific distribution should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.
