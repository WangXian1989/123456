The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; this is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices**: Look at the fees and investment options. Prioritize funds with lower fees and good performance.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Benefits**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits ($6,500 for 2023, $7,500 if over 50).
   - **Tax Bracket**: Consider your current and expected future tax brackets to decide between Traditional and Roth contributions.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments that do not fit within the tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxable events.

### 4. **General Strategy**
   - **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions before investing heavily in taxable accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio according to your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation. 

Ultimately, your distribution strategy should align with your long-term financial goals, so take the time to plan accordingly!
