The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), so consider your current vs. future tax rates.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Contributions**: Aim to max out your IRA contributions after youâ€™ve received the full employer match in your 401(k).
   - **Tax Strategy**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Use taxable accounts for investment goals that are shorter-term or for funds you might need before retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in assets with lower tax implications (like index funds or tax-exempt bonds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before putting money into taxable accounts.
- **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, and real estate) based on your risk tolerance.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically and adjust them based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Consider Your Goals:
- **Retirement Timeline**: Earlier investors might prioritize growth, while those nearing retirement may want to shift towards more stable, income-producing investments.
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid form before tying up your money in retirement accounts.
