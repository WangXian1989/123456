While I can't provide specific financial advice, I can help you think creatively about your situation. A good writing exercise might involve crafting a narrative around your financial journey. 

1. **Brainstorm**: Consider why each account matters to you. What dreams are you funding? Retirement, a home, travel? 

2. **Search**: Look for inspiration in stories of people who have balanced their financial goals through diverse investments. 

3. **Hypothesize**: Think about how your distribution could look. What percentage might go to each account, and why? 

4. **Refine**: Write a short piece reflecting on your financial philosophy. How does it align with your values and aspirations?

By expressing your thoughts creatively, you can gain clarity on your financial decisions. Would you like to explore any of these steps in more detail?
