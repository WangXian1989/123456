Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is effectively free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA next, particularly if it's a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) where gains can grow without immediate taxation.
   - Use taxable accounts for lower-growth investments (like bonds), which may generate less taxable income.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawals according to tax implications. For example, withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket, prioritizing Roth accounts can be beneficial. Conversely, if you're in a higher bracket, traditional accounts may provide immediate tax relief.

5. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Always consider consulting a financial planner for personalized advice that suits your specific circumstances.
