Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider fully funding this account next, either a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds) to minimize tax liabilities.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Generally suited for long-term growth; consider higher-risk investments here.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on investments that can provide liquidity and flexibility, or those that yield lower tax implications.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Keep an eye on asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Conclusion
Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts while considering your overall investment plan, tax implications, and financial objectives. Consulting with a financial advisor can further tailor a strategy to your needs.
