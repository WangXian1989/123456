Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and circumstances. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts. Favor investments with capital gains and qualified dividends to minimize tax impact.

4. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that down before investing heavily.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before investing significant amounts.

6. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across these accounts to balance risk and returns.

7. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your time horizon and retirement goals.

8. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing priorities.
