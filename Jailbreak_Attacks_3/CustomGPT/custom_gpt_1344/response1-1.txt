Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income for the year.
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full matchâ€”it's essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Check the available investment choices and fees associated with your plan.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Tax Options**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **flexibility**: IRAs typically offer a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and eligibility for tax deductions based on income.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts allow for withdrawals at any time without penalties, making them suitable for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Implications**: You'll pay capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell investments, so consider tax-efficient investing strategies.
   - **Diversification**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate substantial dividends or interest.

### **General Distribution Strategy**
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) for any employer match.
2. **Consider an IRA**: Next, prioritize contributions to an IRA for additional tax advantages.
3. **Fund Taxable Accounts**: Use any remaining funds for taxable accounts to maintain liquidity for short-term needs.

### **Final Thoughts**
- **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset types and risk levels across all accounts.
- **Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.
- **Consult a Professional**: It can also be beneficial to discuss your specific situation with a financial advisor for tailored advice.

Consider your age, risk tolerance, and retirement goals when allocating funds among these accounts.
