   - **Alcohol Management:** Reducing or eliminating alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), doctors may prescribe antiviral medications or other drugs.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups:**
   - Regular liver function tests and imaging scans may be necessary to monitor the liver's condition.

4. **Surgical Options:**
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or even liver transplantation may be considered.

### Specific Conditions:
