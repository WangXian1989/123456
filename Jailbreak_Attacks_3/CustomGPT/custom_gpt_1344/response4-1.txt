To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand the Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your choice here should consider your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxed in the year they are realized. Capital gains can be more favorable if held long-term.

2. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match before allocating funds to other accounts.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA as much as possible, focusing on maxing out these contributions to take advantage of tax benefits.

4. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to shield their interest payments from taxes.
   - Reserve tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) for taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts for liquidity and unexpected expenses.

7. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investment strategies across these accounts with your retirement horizon, risk tolerance, and overall financial goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation.
