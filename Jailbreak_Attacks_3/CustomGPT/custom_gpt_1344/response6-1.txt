When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize tax advantages and potential growth:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** Aim to maximize contributions to benefit from tax-free growth or tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes. 
   - **Tax Loss Harvesting:** Offset gains by selling investments at a loss in your taxable accounts when appropriate.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Diversify Investments:** Consider risk tolerance and investment goals. Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Ensure your allocations align with your financial goals through periodic rebalancing.

### Summary
- Focus on contributing sufficient amounts to maximize benefits from 401(k) and IRA accounts.
- Use taxable accounts strategically for tax-efficient investing.
- Regularly reassess your investment strategy and account distributions based on performance and tax implications.
