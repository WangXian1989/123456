To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Taxability of Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for high-income earners.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k) with tax-deferred growth. Consider Roth IRAs for tax-free growth if eligible.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax on profits. Use for flexibility and immediate access.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for income-generating assets like bonds or dividend-paying stocks to manage tax impacts.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Maximize employer match in your 401(k) first.
   - Contribute to an IRA, then go back to your 401(k) until you reach contribution limits.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Balance your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, cash) according to your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - Rebalance periodically to maintain desired risk levels.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, avoid touching tax-deferred accounts until necessary to prolong tax advantages.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your strategy regularly based on market conditions, changes in income, and tax laws.

By strategically allocating your investments while considering tax implications and flexibility, you can enhance your overall financial growth.
