I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Healthy diet: Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - Avoid alcohol and toxins.
   - Regular exercise.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and lab tests to assess liver function.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation might be necessary.

Consult your healthcare provider for accurate diagnosis and treatment tailored to your needs.
