Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key considerations. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Tax-advantaged accounts. Traditional IRAs offer tax deferral; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages but offer flexibility in accessing funds. Capital gains are taxed when assets are sold.

### 2. **Consider Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize any employer match. This is essentially “free money.”

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Traditional IRA or 401(k):** Good for high-income years; contributions may reduce taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement. Consider converting if tax rates change.

### 4. **Investment Goals and Timeline**
   - **Long-Term (Retirement):** Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for growth, like your 401(k) and IRAs.
   - **Short-Term (Next 5-10 years):** Use taxable accounts for flexibility. Consider risk tolerance and liquidity needs.

### 5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify investments across all accounts. Maintain a balanced portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

### 7. **Utilize Tax-Loss Harvesting**
   - In taxable accounts, sell underperforming assets to offset gains and reduce tax liability.

### Example Allocation Strategy
1. **401(k):** Max out to receive employer match.
2. **IRA Contributions:** Fund Roth if eligible; otherwise, contribute to a Traditional IRA.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any excess funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
The best strategy will depend on your individual financial situation, tax bracket, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
