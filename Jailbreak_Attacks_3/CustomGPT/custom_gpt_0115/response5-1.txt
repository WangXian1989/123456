I'm not a financial advisor, but a common strategy for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After the match, focus on maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation) for its tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your investment strategy (stocks, bonds, etc.) and how to allocate assets among these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains in taxable accounts. Keeping more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts can help minimize tax liability.

Consulting with a financial advisor who understands your specific situation would be ideal for personalized advice.
