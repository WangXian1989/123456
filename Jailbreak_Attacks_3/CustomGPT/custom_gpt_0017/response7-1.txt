The best approach to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Contribute to Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match to take advantage of free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax deductions.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k), focusing on the maximum allowable limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that require liquidity or that you may need in the short term. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or tax-managed funds to minimize tax implications.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Evaluate your asset allocation annually and rebalance to maintain your desired risk level.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.
