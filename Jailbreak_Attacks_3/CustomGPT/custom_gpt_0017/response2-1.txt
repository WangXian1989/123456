To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out your deferral limit if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional IRA for tax benefits, or a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. They offer flexibility for withdrawals but are taxed on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Hold higher-growth assets like stocks.
   - **Roth IRA**: Similar to taxable, but since gains are tax-free, consider high-growth investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocation to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Factor in your current and expected future tax rates; prioritize tax-deferred accounts when you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

7. **Liquidity Needs**: Ensure you maintain enough liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
