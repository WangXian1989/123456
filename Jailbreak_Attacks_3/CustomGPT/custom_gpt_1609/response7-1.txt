The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first; this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) (or $30,000 if you're over 50) and up to $6,500 to an IRA (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k). 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed on any realized gains, dividends, and interest, so theyâ€™re better suited for shorter-term goals or if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings in cash or equivalents for emergencies before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account, ensure you are diversifying across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Long-Term Strategy**: Generally, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth, while using taxable accounts for short-term needs or if you need access to funds before retirement age.

7. **Regular Review and Adjustment**: Monitor your investments and adjust your allocations as needed based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor an approach that best suits your individual circumstances.
