When distributing funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you expect to sell in the near future (where capital gains tax may apply) and for investments generating dividend income, as they are subject to different tax rates than ordinary income.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - In tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, ETFs) that benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth (in the case of Roth accounts).
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for tax advantages.

4. **Emergency Fund and Liquid Assets**:
   - Maintain some liquid assets in taxable accounts to cover emergencies or immediate needs, rather than relying solely on retirement accounts.

5. **Rebalancing and Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you age, shift to a more conservative allocation to preserve capital, potentially favoring bonds in retirement accounts.
   - Consider using taxable accounts for short-term needs and reserving tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Each individualâ€™s situation is unique. A financial advisor can tailor strategies based on your specific goals, risk tolerance, and tax circumstances.

By blending maximum contributions to your 401(k) and IRA while strategically managing your taxable investments, you can optimize tax efficiency and growth potential.
