Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **401(k):** 
   - **Employer Match:** Prioritize contributing enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Max out your contributions if possible, especially if you're in your peak earning years.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Benefits:** Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you're eligible, or a Traditional IRA if you prefer tax deductions now.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for IRAs and strategize accordingly.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investment choices. Use them for additional investments once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Long-Term Investments:** Focus on long-term investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Contribute to your 401(k)** up to the employer match.
2. **Max out an IRA** each year to take advantage of tax benefits.
3. **Invest any remaining funds in a taxable account** for flexibility and liquidity.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific circumstances and goals.
