Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your contributions if your employer match is substantial.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for added flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, such as long-term capital gains or qualified dividends.
   - Keep higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these investments.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow, adjust your allocations to maintain your intended risk level.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. Contribute to your 401(k) up to the match limit.
2. Max out your IRA contributions.
3. Any remaining funds can be allocated to a taxable account.

### Consider Consulting a Financial Advisor:
It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.
