Allocating your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your **401(k)** to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a **Traditional or Roth IRA**. A Roth allows tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional offers pre-tax contributions.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've maxed out your IRA contributions, direct additional funds to your **401(k)**, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket, as it reduces taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investment beyond retirement accounts. This can be advantageous for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing funds before retirement.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Assess your portfolio regularly to ensure it aligns with your long-term goals, adjusting as necessary based on changes in tax laws, your financial situation, or market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income (up to employer match)
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: $6,500 annually (if eligible)
- **Remaining funds**: Place in a taxable account.

It’s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
