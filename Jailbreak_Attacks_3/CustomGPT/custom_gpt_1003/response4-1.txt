To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first—it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Great for tax savings now; grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Ideal if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement because qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need in the near future or for investments that generate lower tax liabilities (like index funds).

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically, this account may have a limited selection of investment options. Choose a diversified mix based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: You have a wider range of investment choices, such as stocks, bonds, and ETFs. Tailor your investments based on your retirement timeline and goals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on growth investments but consider income-generating ones that can lead to tax-efficient withdrawals.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - For personalized advice, especially concerning your tax situation and long-term goals, working with a professional can help optimize your strategy.

Using this approach allows you to maximize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
