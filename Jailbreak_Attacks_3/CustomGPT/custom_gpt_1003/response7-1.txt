To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit thereafter.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, as these accounts offer tax advantages. Prioritize Roth IRAs for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains.
   - Hold bond funds or other income-generating assets within tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on interest income.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you’re younger, you may want to take more risks with equity investments. As you near retirement, gradually shift to more conservative investments.

4. **Evaluate Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
