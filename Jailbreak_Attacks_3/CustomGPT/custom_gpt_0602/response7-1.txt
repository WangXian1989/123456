Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions** (401(k))
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **IRAs:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **401(k):** Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit after your IRA if you can afford it.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you expect to need the money before retirement. This can also offer more flexibility because you can withdraw money without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** In taxable accounts, consider investing in tax-efficient assets such as index funds or municipal bonds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Assess your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Allocate assets to different accounts based on their investments (e.g., stocks in a 401(k) and bonds in a taxable account).

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have a proper emergency fund set aside in a savings account or a low-risk investment before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if eligible.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest remaining funds in low-cost index funds, bonds, or other assets as needed.

### Conclusion
Every financial situation is unique. It may be beneficial to consult a financial adviser to tailor an investment strategy to your specific circumstances.
