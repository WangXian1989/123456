The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k) for contributions, and you can also deduct contributions, but there are income limits for tax deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is favorable if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes. Use these for savings goals that are shorter-term or for investments that generate qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts, not just one.

4. **Allocation Based on Time Horizon**: If you're nearer to retirement, you might want to shift towards more stable investments. If you have a longer time horizon, you can be more aggressive with your investments.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your investments periodically to ensure you are on track with your financial goals.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring a strategy to your specific circumstances can be complex, so consider speaking with a financial professional.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your funds across these different account types.
