The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k) for contributions, but check if a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions) might be better for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts have less tax advantage but offer more flexibility for access and investment choices. Consider these for short-term goals or if you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Across all accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks, bonds, and various asset classes can help manage risk.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**: Consider placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts for optimal tax efficiency.

5. **Revisit Regularly**: Your strategy may need adjustments as your goals, risk tolerance, or tax situations change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It can be beneficial to work with a financial planner or advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.

Always consider your long-term goals and financial situation when deciding your distribution strategy.
