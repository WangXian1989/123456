When distributing money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits, such as pre-tax contributions in a 401(k) and tax-deferred growth in both accounts. Contributing the maximum allowed can help reduce your taxable income.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each type of account:
   - For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - The IRA contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). 

3. **Consider Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match before moving to other accounts. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

4. **Balance Investments Based on Goals**: Align your investments with your financial goals. For long-term growth, stocks may be appropriate for your 401(k) and IRA. For more immediate needs or shorter-term goals, consider holding more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Focus on Asset Location**: Consider where to place your investments based on their tax efficiency. For instance:
   - Place bonds in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k) since they generate interest that is taxed as ordinary income.
   - Keep stocks in taxable accounts for capital gains treatment, allowing those investments to grow tax-efficiently.

6. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing from each type of account, especially if you're nearing retirement age.

7. **Diversify**: Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across asset classes to reduce risk.

8. **Review Regularly**: Your situation and financial goals may change, so review your account allocations and investments periodically to ensure they still align with your objectives.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your individual circumstances.
