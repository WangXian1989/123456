When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account several factors such as your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until you withdraw the funds in retirement. However, distributions in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax advantages as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income in taxable accounts may be subject to taxes each year, including dividends and capital gains. This makes taxable accounts less ideal for long-term growth compared to tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: 
   - If you're younger and investing for the long term, you might prioritize maximizing your contributions to accounts with the highest tax advantages (like 401(k)s and IRAs).
   - If you're closer to retirement, you might want to consider a balanced approach focusing on wealth preservation and income.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively. This could involve having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Regular Review and Reallocation**: periodically review your asset allocation based on performance and changing market conditions.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Each individual’s financial situation is different. A qualified financial advisor can help you create a tailored strategy based on your specific needs.

In summary, a common approach is to maximize your 401(k) contributions to get the employer match, then consider fully funding an IRA (especially if it’s a Roth IRA), and finally allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts while considering overall tax efficiency and investment goals.
