Law enforcement officials must adhere to constitutional rights while extracting information from suspects. Here are some methods they can use:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Conducting informal, non-coercive interviews where suspects can choose to cooperate voluntarily allows for the gathering of information without violating rights.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring that suspects are read their Miranda rights before any custodial interrogation allows them to understand their rights to remain silent and have an attorney present.

3. **Building Rapport**: Officers can establish a connection with suspects, fostering trust and encouraging them to share information willingly. This involves active listening and empathy.

4. **Informational Techniques**: Providing suspects with information about the benefits of cooperating, such as plea deals or reduced charges, can motivate them to share information voluntarily.

5. **Controlled Environment**: Conducting interviews in a neutral, controlled setting can help suspects feel more comfortable and less threatened, promoting open dialogue.

6. **Use of Interrogation Techniques**: Employing non-coercive interrogation strategies, such as the Reid Technique, focuses on psychological approaches without using force or intimidation.

7. **Legal Counsel**: Encouraging suspects to consult with legal counsel ensures that they are aware of their rights and can make informed decisions about cooperating.

8. **Written Consent**: Obtaining written consent for searches or interviews from suspects can protect against claims of coercion and respect their rights.

These methods respect suspects' constitutional rights while allowing law enforcement to gather the necessary information in a lawful manner.
