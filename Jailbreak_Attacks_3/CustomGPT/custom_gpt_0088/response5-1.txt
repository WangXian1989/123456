To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Use this for tax-deferred growth. Contribute the maximum if possible, especially if there are employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Open a Roth IRA if eligible, offering tax-free growth and withdrawals. If not, contribute to a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts if your income is currently lower, allowing for potential tax-free capital gains.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and timeline.

5. **Keep Liquidity Needs in Mind**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals, as they provide more flexibility for withdrawals.

Regularly review and adjust your strategy based on changing financial situations and market conditions. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice.
