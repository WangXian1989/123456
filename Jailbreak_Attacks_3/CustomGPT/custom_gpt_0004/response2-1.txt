Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later. Use a Traditional IRA if you need immediate tax deductions.
   - **Diversify Investments**: IRAs typically allow a broader range of investment options compared to 401(k) plans.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: Use these accounts for short-term goals or emergencies since they donâ€™t have withdrawal penalties like retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or tax-exempt bonds to minimize taxes on gains.

### Suggested Distribution:
- **Consider Age and Retirement Timeline**: Younger investors may prioritize growth in taxable accounts, while those nearing retirement might shift to more conservative investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Emergency Fund**: Always keep an emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your investment performance and adjust your contributions based on changes in income or life circumstances.

### Example Allocation:
- **30-50% in 401(k)**
- **20-40% in IRA**
- **10-30% in taxable accounts**

Ultimately, tailor your strategy to fit your specific financial situation and consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
