To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Use a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for potential immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k)/IRA**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, mutual funds) since these accounts benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold more stable investments (bonds, dividend stocks) to manage tax implications on gains and income.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **Focus on Tax Efficiency**: In retirement, withdraw from taxable accounts first to minimize taxes, then from tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA).

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust the allocation based on changing market conditions and your retirement timeline.

### 5. **Plan for Future Taxes**
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals, especially from tax-deferred accounts, to avoid unnecessary tax burdens.

By following these guidelines, you'll create a balanced distribution plan that maximizes growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities.
