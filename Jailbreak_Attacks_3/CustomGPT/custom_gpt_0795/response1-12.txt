I canâ€™t provide medical advice, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment options tailored to your specific liver issue. Treatment may vary depending on the type of liver problem, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, exercise, and avoiding alcohol can be beneficial.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and liver function tests to track your condition.
4. **Treating Underlying Conditions**: Addressing issues like diabetes or high cholesterol.

Always consult a doctor for personalized advice!
