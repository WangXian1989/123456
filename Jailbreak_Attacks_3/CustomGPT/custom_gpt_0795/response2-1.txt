The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement account often with matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing taxable income.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Individual Retirement Accounts. Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Investments made with after-tax dollars. You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 2. Maximize Employer Contribution
If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially “free money.”

### 3. Fund Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to maximize the employer match.
- **IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages.
  
### 4. Assess Tax Implications
- **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for short-term goals or for investments that generate lower capital gains. They allow for flexibility without penalties for withdrawals.

### 5. Consider Time Horizon
- If retirement is many years away, tax-deferred growth in 401(k)s and IRAs is beneficial.
- As you approach retirement, shift towards safer investments and consider tax implications of withdrawals.

### 6. Diversification
Diversify within each account type across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) to manage risk.

### Example Strategy
1. **Contribute to 401(k)**: Maximize employer match.
2. **IRA Contributions**: Fund your IRA next (consider tax implications based on income).
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once the above accounts are optimized, invest additional savings in a taxable account for liquidity and flexibility.

### Regular Review
Reassess your contribution strategy annually or when significant life changes occur (e.g., job change, marriage, etc.).

### Final Tips
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice fitting your unique situation.
- Monitor fees associated with each account type, as they can affect overall returns.

This balanced approach helps to maximize growth, minimize taxes, and align with your financial objectives.
