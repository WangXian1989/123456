Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing growth potential, tax implications, and liquidity needs. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim for the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA:** Depending on eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits. 

### 2. **Choose Investments Wisely**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on growth-oriented assets (like stocks) in these accounts to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Prioritize more conservative investments (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) to minimize tax exposure since these will be taxed annually.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term (10+ years):** Allocate more to equity-heavy investments in retirement accounts, skipping less tax-efficient options.
   - **Shorter-Term (0-10 years):** Keep enough liquid cash in taxable accounts for immediate needs while maintaining some growth through conservative investments.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your portfolio at least annually to align with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

### Conclusion
Crafting a strategic allocation will depend on your individual financial goals, income level, and tax situation. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
