Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and the specific benefits of each type of account. Here’s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Why?** This is essentially free money. Contribute enough to get the full match before moving to other accounts.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Why?** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth. Choose based on your current vs. anticipated future tax rate.

### 3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**
   - **Why?** After any employer match and IRA contributions, increase your 401(k) contributions as needed. It offers higher contribution limits than IRAs.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Why?** After maximizing retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional savings. They provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment options.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**
   - Balance between tax-deferred growth (401(k) and IRA) and taxable accounts to manage your tax liability and access needs.

### 6. **Investment Strategy**
   - Diversify investments across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider asset location strategies—higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable, income-generating assets in taxable accounts.

### 7. **Review Regularly**
   - Regularly assess and adjust your contributions and investment strategies based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.
