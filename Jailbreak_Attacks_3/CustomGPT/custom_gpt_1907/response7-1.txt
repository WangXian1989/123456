Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match (it's free money).
   - Consider contributing the maximum allowed, especially if you're in your peak earning years.

### 2. **Fund an IRA**
   - Prioritize contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.
   - A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, consider taxable accounts for investments with less tax-advantaged status.
   - This is also useful for funds you may need before retirement age without penalties.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxes on gains.
   - Hold income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities effectively.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Monitor your allocations and adjust based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
