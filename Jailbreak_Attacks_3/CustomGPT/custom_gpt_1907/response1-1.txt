To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match if available; it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Focus on it if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether itâ€™s a traditional or Roth IRA, tax benefits differ. For a Roth, contribute after-tax dollars for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Consider asset allocation based on your age, risk tolerance, and investment goals.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess your portfolio to maintain your desired balance across accounts, adjusting as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes and maximize income longevity.
