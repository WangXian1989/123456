Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and overall investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out your contributions if you have the financial flexibility.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Determine whether a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA is more beneficial for you. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep track of annual contribution limits. Prioritize maxing out if feasible.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might have high turnover or that you may want to access before retirement age.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding long-term investments in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Higher-risk investments may be better suited for long-term accounts, while more stable investments might be preferred for taxable accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure you diversify your portfolio across different asset classes to mitigate risk.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to align with your financial goals and market conditions.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts and the timing of withdrawals from retirement accounts.

### Conclusion:
A common approach is to maximize contributions to the 401(k) and IRA first, taking advantage of tax benefits, and then consider funding a taxable account with any excess funds.
