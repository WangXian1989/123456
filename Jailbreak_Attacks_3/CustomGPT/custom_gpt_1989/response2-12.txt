Iâ€™m not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplant might be considered.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore herbal supplements or nutritional therapies, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting these.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a personalized approach based on your specific condition.
