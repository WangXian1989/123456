Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax implications, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. Consider maxing out your contributions if you can afford it.
   - **IRA:** If you’re eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions reduce your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Growth is taxed annually, so consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

### 3. **Allocate Investments Wisely:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, ETFs) due to their long-term nature and tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider placing investment income-generating assets here to manage your tax liability.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs:**
   - Keep some funds in your taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies since these accounts are more liquid and accessible without penalties.

### 5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to maintain your desired risk profile and investment strategy.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

### Summary:
Prioritize contributions towards tax-advantaged accounts, consider your tax implications, focus on investments suited to each account type, and ensure you have enough liquidity for unexpected needs.
