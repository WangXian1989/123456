Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:**
     - If your employer matches contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:**
     - Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are tax-free in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Invest in assets that produce lower taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) due to their favorable capital gains treatment.
     - Consider holding bonds or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 3. **Investment Growth:**
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts for potential higher growth and tax benefits.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments that may generate income.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how and when you’ll withdraw from each account to manage taxes effectively in retirement. 

### 5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach focusing on employer matches, tax efficiency, and withdrawal strategies can maximize your investment growth and minimize taxes in the long run. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
