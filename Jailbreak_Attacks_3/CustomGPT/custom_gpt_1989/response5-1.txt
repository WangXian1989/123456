To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then max out your IRA contributions for additional tax benefits. If possible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

2. **Assess Tax Situations**: Allocate funds based on the tax implications. The 401(k) and traditional IRA offer tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment goals. Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep track of your asset allocation and rebalance periodically to maintain your desired risk level across all accounts.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

This strategy helps you optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
