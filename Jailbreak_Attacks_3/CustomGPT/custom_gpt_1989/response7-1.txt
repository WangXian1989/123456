To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match — it’s essentially free money. If your budget allows, aim to maximize your contributions to the annual limit.
   - **IRA**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider funding a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and income limits.

2. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months’ worth of expenses in a liquid savings account before heavily investing in taxable accounts. 

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may be less tax-efficient, such as bonds, or for short-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Adjust your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Aim for a diversified portfolio that includes stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations at least once a year to maintain your desired risk level and adjust for market performance.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes in your taxable accounts. Long-term investments typically incur lower taxes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized strategies that fit your financial goals and circumstances.

This balanced approach helps maximize growth potential while managing tax implications effectively.
