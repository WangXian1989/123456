Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to capture any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Consider prioritizing contributions to an IRA or Roth IRA after maxing out your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be advantageous in retirement.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - Use tax-efficient investment strategies in taxable accounts, such as indexing or investing in tax-managed funds, to minimize tax burdens.
   - Consider holding interest-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high tax rates.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize tax-deferred accounts to reduce your current taxable income.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial despite its immediate tax implications.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy to minimize taxes during retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustments**
   - Reassess your allocations periodically (e.g., annually) to align with changes in income, tax laws, and personal circumstances.

### Conclusion
By strategically allocating your investments across these accounts, you can optimize growth potential while managing your tax liabilities effectively.
