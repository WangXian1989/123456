To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxes. Use taxable accounts for tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).

2. **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA if possible, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.

3. **Liquidity Needs**: Ensure that you keep some funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs. Retirement accounts incur penalties for early withdrawals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts. This might mean adjusting the mix in each account to achieve your overall target.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for withdrawals strategically in retirement to optimize your tax situation.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced and efficient investment strategy.
