I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general options that are often considered for liver issues. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized approach. Here are some common treatment options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fats, sugars, and alcohol can help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity aids liver health.
   - **Weight Management**: Losing weight if overweight can improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the type of liver disease (like hepatitis), antiviral medications or other specific drugs may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver enzymes and overall function.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**:
   - Stay away from alcohol, certain medications, and environmental toxins that can exacerbate liver issues.

5. **Surgery or Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, options like liver transplantation may be considered.

Always seek medical advice tailored to your specific condition.
