The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: This is a great option if you want to reduce your taxable income. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). 
   - **IRA**: Contributing to a Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRA contributions grow tax-free. The contribution limit for an IRA for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50).

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: Understanding the tax implications of withdrawals is crucial. Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals under certain conditions. Taxable accounts don't have upfront tax benefits, but you’ll pay capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Investment Goals**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals:
   - If you’re closer to retirement, safer investments might be more appropriate, especially in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - Taxable accounts can be a place to invest in more volatile assets since you have more flexibility with withdrawals.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments to spread risk.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**: In retirement, develop a strategy for when to withdraw money from each type of account. This can depend on tax implications and your income needs. Generally, it’s wise to start with taxable accounts before tapping into tax-deferred accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

7. **Regular Reviews and Adjustments**: Regularly review your investment allocations and financial situation to make necessary adjustments. Life changes (like marriage, children, job changes) may affect how you want to allocate your investments.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice to suit your specific needs and financial situation, enhancing the effectiveness of your investment strategy.
