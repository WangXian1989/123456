Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Focus on maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. The contribution limits for these accounts are typically higher and grow tax-deferred.
   - For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to your 401(k) (or $30,000 if you're over 50) and $6,500 to an IRA (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Diversification**: 
   - Within these accounts, ensure that your investments are diversified. This means spreading your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to minimize risk.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Once you maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: 
   - If you’re in a higher tax bracket now, it might be wise to prioritize tax-deferred accounts. Conversely, if you're in a lower bracket currently and expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth IRA contributions (if eligible) for tax-free growth.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - As you approach retirement, plan your withdrawal strategy. The order you withdraw from these accounts can significantly affect your tax liability.

7. **Review Regularly**: 
   - Your financial situation may change, so it’s essential to review your allocations regularly and adjust them based on your goals, market conditions, and changes in tax laws.
