Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is free money and a great return on investment.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income but will be taxed upon withdrawal during retirement. Consider maxing out this account if your tax rate is higher now than it will be in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth but will be taxed during retirement. 
     - Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current tax bracket, you might prefer one over the other.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These provide flexibility since you can withdraw your money anytime without penalties. However, you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains. Use taxable accounts for investments in assets that produce lower capital gains or those you plan to hold long-term.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure an appropriate mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Withdrawals**: Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement. It may be beneficial to take from taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Rebalance and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and asset allocation to keep them aligned with your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can help you create a personalized strategy based on your individual situation, risk tolerance, financial goals, and tax situation.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
