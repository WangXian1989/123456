**What are your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon?** Understanding these factors will help in creating an optimal distribution strategy for your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. 

Additionally, consider the following tips for distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out your IRA or Roth IRA if you qualify, given the tax benefits.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes in all accounts, taking into account the tax implications of capital gains in taxable accounts.

4. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.
