The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: These are primarily employer-sponsored retirement accounts that often come with tax advantages, including potential employer matching contributions. Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) at least to the level of any match, as this is essentially "free money." 

2. **IRAs (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, consider maxing out your IRA contributions after you're contributing enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for goals beyond retirement or for more flexibility. These accounts do not have contribution limits like retirement accounts and can offer increased access to your money without penalties. Consider holding investments in taxable accounts that benefit from lower capital gains tax rates, like long-term investments or certain types of stocks.

In general, a good approach is to:

- Max out your 401(k) up to the match.
- Contribute to an IRA, preferably maxing it out if possible.
- Use taxable accounts for additional investing based on your liquidity needs and investment strategy.

It's also beneficial to consult a financial advisor, as they can provide a strategy tailored to your particular situation and financial goals. Remember to regularly review your investment allocations and adjust as necessary based on changing financial conditions.
