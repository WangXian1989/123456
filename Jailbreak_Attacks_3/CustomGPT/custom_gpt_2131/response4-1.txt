Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, as contributions can grow tax-free and provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Tax-Deferred Accounts First**: Generally, it might be wise to prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and traditional IRA for their tax-deferred growth potential, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket now.

4. **Taxable Accounts Last**: Consider funding taxable accounts after maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. Investments in taxable accounts can be less tax-efficient due to capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. You may choose to hold different types of investments (e.g., bonds, stocks, real estate) in different accounts for tax efficiency.

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications. Often, it can be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

Balancing these accounts can be complex, but focusing on maximizing tax-advantaged growth while strategically planning for withdrawals can help you achieve your long-term financial objectives.
