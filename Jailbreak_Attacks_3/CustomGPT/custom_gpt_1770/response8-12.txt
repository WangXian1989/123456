I'd recommend consulting a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from vitamins or herbal supplements, but always check with a doctor first.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver surgery or transplantation might be necessary.

Always discuss with your doctor for tailored treatment options!
