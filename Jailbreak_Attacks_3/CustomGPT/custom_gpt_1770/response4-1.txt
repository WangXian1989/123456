Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, contribute to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs may give you a tax deduction upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider funding a taxable investment account. This is useful for flexibility and accessing funds before retirement age without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Focus on asset allocation and investment choices in each account type, considering their tax implications. For instance:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Use for higher-tax investments (bonds, REITs) since you won't pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Ideal for high-growth investments since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Your age and when you plan to retire will influence how aggressively you invest in each account type.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances may also be beneficial.
