Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. Prioritize Contributions
- **401(k):** Maximize your contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially "free money."
- **IRA:** Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Focus on placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use this for investments that produce lower taxable gains, like bonds or tax-efficient funds.

### 3. Diversification
- Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across all accounts to balance risk and return effectively.

### 4. Review Regularly
- Assess and rebalance your distribution periodically based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific needs and goals.
