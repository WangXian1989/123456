Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is free money!).
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Set Contribution Limits**
   - Aim to hit the maximum contribution limits for your accounts:
     - **401(k):** $22,500 for 2024 (plus an additional $7,500 if you’re 50+).
     - **IRA:** $6,500 for 2024 (plus an additional $1,000 if 50+).

### 3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. They're ideal for short-term savings, and you can use tax strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Diversify your investments across accounts to balance risks. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Investment Strategy**
   - Use a consistent asset allocation across all accounts. For example, hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on interest income.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 7. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - Consider your withdrawal strategy in retirement, as withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts can impact your tax bracket.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailoring a strategy to your specific situation can be complex, so getting professional advice can be beneficial.

By following these steps, you can create an effective distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
