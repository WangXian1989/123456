When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account factors like tax implications, your retirement goals, and your current financial situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA:** Consider maximizing your contributions here as well, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, which provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Balance Between Growth and Accessibility:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts. While they don’t offer the same tax advantages, they provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Allocate Based on Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:**
   - **Aggressive Growth Investments:** In your 401(k) and IRA, you might want to lean towards stocks or mutual funds with higher growth potential since these won't be touched for years.
   - **More Conservative Assets:** In taxable accounts or as you near retirement, shift to bonds or conservative investments to preserve capital.

4. **Consider Tax Implications of Withdrawals:**
   - Understand that withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs will be taxed as regular income, while withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.
   - Keeping this in mind, you might want to take withdrawals from your taxable accounts first in retirement to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

By prioritizing contributions and considering the structure of your investments according to your goals, you can optimize your financial strategy effectively. It’s always advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your approach to your specific circumstances.
