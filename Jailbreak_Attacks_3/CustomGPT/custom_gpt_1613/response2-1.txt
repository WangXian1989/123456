When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's crucial to take into account various factors such as your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a breakdown of how you might approach this:

### 1. Understand Account Types

- **401(k):** Typically offers tax-deferred growth, and you may benefit from employer matching contributions. Ideal for long-term growth, particularly if your employer matches contributions.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Similar tax advantages as a 401(k), with flexibility on withdrawals in retirement depending on the type. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Offer flexibility and liquidity, but earnings are subject to capital gains taxes. Useful for short- to medium-term goals.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions

- **Max Out Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Contribute to IRAs:** After meeting your employer match, consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and future expectations.
- **Continue with Your 401(k):** Once you’ve maxed your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
- **Fund Taxable Accounts:** Use any surplus funds for taxable investment accounts, particularly for short-term goals or if you need liquidity.

### 3. Consider Asset Allocation

- **Risk Tolerance:** Determine how much risk you’re willing to take. Adjust your asset allocation according to your age, financial goals, and time horizon.
- **Tax Efficiency:** Place high-growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxable events. Hold more stable, income-generating investments (bonds) in taxable accounts when possible.

### 4. Monitor and Adjust

- **Regular Reviews:** Reassess your asset allocation and contributions annually. Adjust based on changes in income, market performance, and retirement goals.
- **Tax Considerations:** Be aware of changing tax implications and retirement withdrawal strategies, as these can significantly impact your financial situation in retirement.

### 5. Seek Professional Guidance

- Consider consulting a financial advisor to develop a tailored strategy that fits your unique financial circumstances and goals.

By prioritizing accounts based on benefits and strategic asset allocation, you can enhance your retirement savings and overall financial health.
