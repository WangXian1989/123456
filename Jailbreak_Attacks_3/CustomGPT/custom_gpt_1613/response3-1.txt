Distributing your money wisely among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a structured approach to help you make informed decisions:

### 1. Understand Each Account Type
- **401(k)**: Typically offered by employers, it allows pre-tax contributions, which can lower your taxable income. Some employers may offer matching contributions.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). Traditional IRAs benefit you by deferring taxes until withdrawal, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t provide tax advantages. They are more flexible for withdrawals and can be useful for investments outside of retirement.

### 2. Assess Your Financial Goals
- Determine your short-term vs. long-term goals.
- Consider whether you are saving specifically for retirement, a home, or another major expense.

### 3. Evaluate Your Current Tax Situation
- Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts based on your current tax bracket and expected future income.
- Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies in taxable accounts to offset gains.

### 4. Contributing Strategy
- **Max Out Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it.
- **Consider IRAs**: After maximally contributing to your 401(k) and employer match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your tax situation.
- **Save in Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maxing out retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts for greater flexibility.

### 5. Diversification
- Ensure that investments in each account are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

### 6. Withdrawal Strategy
- Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement, considering tax implications and required minimum distributions (RMDs).

### 7. Periodic Review
- Review your distribution strategy annually to adjust for changes in income, expenses, and life circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can further tailor your strategy to your unique situation. Balancing tax liabilities while maximizing contributions to retirement accounts will benefit your long-term financial health. 

### Final Tip
Remember, the earlier you start investing in these accounts, the more you can take advantage of compound growth over time.
