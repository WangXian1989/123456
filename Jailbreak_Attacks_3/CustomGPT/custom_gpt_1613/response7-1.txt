Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a guideline to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match. Aim to contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, this can be advantageous.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Types of IRAs**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be the better option.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and income thresholds for Roth IRA eligibility.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility since you can access your funds without penalties. They’re great for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liabilities. Pay attention to capital gains taxes on any realized gains.

### Suggested Distribution:
- **Maximize 401(k) contributions up to the employer match.**
- **Contribute to an IRA after you’ve maxed out your 401(k) match.**
- **Fill any gaps with a taxable account, especially if you’re saving for short-term goals.**

### Considerations:
- Revisit your allocations periodically to reflect changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your unique circumstances.

This balanced approach can help maximize your retirement savings while ensuring flexibility for your immediate financial needs.
