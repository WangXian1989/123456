When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider a few key factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: This employer-sponsored retirement account often comes with matching contributions. It's tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on it until you withdraw during retirement.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Traditional IRAs also allow for tax-deferred growth, whereas Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have tax advantages, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals and can be ideal for short-term goals or for using profits after capital gains tax.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money and a great return on investment.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limits are $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

4. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: 
   - Contributing to a traditional 401(k) or IRA can reduce your taxable income now. 
   - A Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment timeframe. This might mean keeping more conservative investments in taxable accounts (to minimize short-term capital gains taxes) and aggressive growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.

6. **Adjust Based on Life Stages**: Your strategy may change over time. When you’re younger, increasing contributions to growth-oriented accounts can be advantageous, while closer to retirement, you might shift to preservation and income generation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the nuances of tax implications and retirement planning, speaking with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies that align with your financial goals and situation.

Always remember, the best allocation varies based on individual circumstances, risk tolerance, and long-term financial goals.
