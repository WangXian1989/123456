To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k):** Tax-deferred, often with employer matching.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Tax advantages; choose based on income limits and withdrawal preferences.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but flexible access to funds.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match—it’s free money.

### 3. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**
   - **Max Contributions:**
     - Contribute the max to your 401(k) and IRA first. For 2024, limits are $23,000 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRA ($7,500 if over age 50).
   - **Choose Account Types Wisely:**
     - Use Roth accounts if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Long-Term Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
     - Focus on growth investments (stocks, mutual funds) in 401(k) and IRA due to compounding returns and tax-deferred growth.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts:**
     - Utilize index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Pay attention to the tax efficiency of your investments. Avoid high-turnover funds in taxable accounts.
   - Rebalance to manage risk, but do so thoughtfully to avoid unnecessary taxes.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside these accounts for liquidity.

### 7. **Regular Review**
   - Reassess your asset allocation and contributions annually or after significant life changes (e.g., marriage, job change).

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. **401(k):** Maximize contributions to receive the full employer match.
2. **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowable amount, prioritizing Roth if eligible.
3. **Taxable Account:** Any remaining funds should go here for investments that you might need access to in the short term.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach focusing on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts while being mindful of investment choices and market conditions will help you effectively distribute your money. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
