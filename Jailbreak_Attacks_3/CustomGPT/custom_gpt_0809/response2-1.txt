When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to evaluate several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth).
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, with tax advantages similar to a 401(k). Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments subject to capital gains tax. More flexible but less favorable for long-term growth compared to tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRA**: Depending on your income level and eligibility, consider maxing out your IRA (traditional or Roth).
   - **Taxable Investments**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Determine your risk tolerance for different accounts. Generally, a more aggressive allocation can be housed in tax-advantaged accounts since withdrawals are typically taken in retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on income.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Withdrawals in Retirement**: Plan for tax implications on withdrawals. Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals, while traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Rebalancing Strategy**: Regularly assess and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation while considering tax impacts.

### 5. **Review and Adjust As Necessary**
   - **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review your allocations and goals, especially as your income and life circumstances change.
   - **Adjust Contributions**: Modify your savings rate and allocations as needed based on your personal financial situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. **Max out 401(k)** to receive the full employer match.
2. **Contribute to both traditional and Roth IRAs**, depending on your tax situation.
3. **Invest additional savings in taxable accounts** using a diversified strategy.

### Conclusion
The ideal distribution strategy depends on your specific circumstances, including your financial goals, age, and risk appetite. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized plans can also be beneficial.
