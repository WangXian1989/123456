Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maximizing contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax considerations.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, but distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax treatment for Traditional IRAs; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, so it may be beneficial to hold low-turnover assets to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Diversification**:
   - Keep a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts. Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or real estate) in tax-advantaged accounts, while placing more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Reevaluate Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and your retirement timeline.

### Conclusion
Align your contributions based on your immediate financial situation, long-term goals, and tax implications to ensure a balanced and efficient investment strategy.
