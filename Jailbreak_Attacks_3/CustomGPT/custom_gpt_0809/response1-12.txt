Iâ€™m not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver issues often include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be considered.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people find benefit in herbal supplements, but consult your doctor first.

Always talk to a healthcare professional for personalized advice!
