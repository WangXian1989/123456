1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Adopting a healthy diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Avoiding alcohol and limiting substances that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications:**
   - Managing underlying conditions (e.g., viral hepatitis) with antiviral medications.
   - Using medications to treat symptoms or complications (e.g., diuretics for fluid retention).

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Routine check-ups to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging tests to assess liver health.

4. **In severe cases:**
   - Consideration for liver transplant if the liver is significantly damaged.

Always follow your doctor's recommendations for tailored treatment suited to your specific situation.
