Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the employer match, if available. Focus on maxing out contributions (up to $22,500 in 2023).
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs are beneficial if you want tax deductions now.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts.
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, since they generate fewer capital gains.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Generally, itâ€™s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - Plan for Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs starting at age 73.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your asset allocation annually or after significant market changes.
   - Ensure that your risk level aligns with your financial goals.

### 5. **Keep Emergency Funds Separate**
   - Maintain a cash reserve for emergencies outside these accounts to avoid penalties.

### Example Distribution Approach:
- **401(k):** 40%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 30%

Adjust based on your specific situation, and consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
