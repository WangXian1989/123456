I'm not a doctor, but treatment options for liver problems can vary depending on the specific condition. Common treatments may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet and exercise can significantly improve liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the diagnosis, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Check-ups and liver function tests to track health progress.
4. **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can be crucial.
5. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like surgery or transplants might be necessary.

Always consult your healthcare provider for tailored advice.
