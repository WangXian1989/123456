Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) and any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Then, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **Tax-deferred Accounts**: Contributions to a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. They offer more flexibility since you can access your money anytime without penalties.

3. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Consider holding more growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts since they can compound without immediate tax impact.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate taxable income (like bonds) or those you might need to access before retirement.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: As you approach retirement, shift toward more conservative investments to protect your capital.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your situation, working with a financial professional is recommended. 

Balancing these accounts effectively can help you optimize growth, tax efficiency, and access to your funds.
