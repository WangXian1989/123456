Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Max Out Employer's 401(k) Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Retirement Accounts First**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out the match, consider contributing to an IRA. A traditional IRA can provide tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: If you're in a high tax bracket now, traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions can lower your taxable income. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, focus on Roth accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund & Debt**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing, and consider paying off high-interest debt first.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized retirement contributions, consider putting money into a taxable account. This can offer more flexibility, as you can access funds without penalties.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

7. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on performance and financial goals.
