Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment strategy and tax efficiency. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your income and tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds here for additional flexibility and access.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are usually tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income while growing tax-deferred. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (after age 59½) are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Capital gains are taxed when you sell investments. Consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:** Allocate higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where growth is taxed at withdrawal rather than at sale.
   - **Bonds and Fixed Income:** Consider placing these in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid annual interest income tax in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Rebalancing Strategy:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and life changes (e.g., retirement age, risk tolerance shifts).

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Each individual’s situation is unique. A financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your overall financial goals.

By strategically distributing your investments, you’ll enhance growth potential while managing tax liabilities effectively.
