Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, contribute to an IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These can be useful for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of capital gains tax when investing here.

### 3. **Investment Goals:**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for funds you may need sooner.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments within each account, considering risk tolerance and time horizon. Riskier assets might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

### 5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your investment strategy based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

### Summary:
Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA for tax benefits, then consider taxable accounts for additional investment flexibility. Always tailor your strategy to align with your personal financial goals and situation.
