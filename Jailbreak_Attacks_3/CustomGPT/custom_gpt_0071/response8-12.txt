I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Avoid alcohol and drugs that can harm the liver.
   - Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may include antiviral drugs for hepatitis or medications to manage symptoms.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups to monitor liver function through blood tests and imaging.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: 
   - Stay away from toxic substances and certain over-the-counter medications that can stress the liver.

5. **Surgery or Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options!
