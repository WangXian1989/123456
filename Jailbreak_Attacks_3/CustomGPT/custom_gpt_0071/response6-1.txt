Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, if eligible.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Bond Holdings:** Place bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high taxes on interest.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - **Stocks vs. Bonds:** Balance your risk tolerance by distributing assets according to your age and retirement goals (e.g., more stocks when younger).
   - **Regular Rebalancing:** Adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

### Final Tips
- **Consider Future Tax Implications:** Think about your expected retirement tax bracket when making distributions.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Tailor strategies to your unique situation.

A well-structured approach can optimize returns and minimize taxes over time.
