Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some suggestions to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, it’s generally wise to contribute enough to get any matching contributions—they're essentially free money. If you're under 50, the contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500, and if you're 50 or older, you can contribute an extra $7,500 as a catch-up contribution. Consider the investment options available in your 401(k) and their associated fees.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). You can choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions with tax-deferred growth) and a Roth IRA (contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but growth and withdrawals are tax-free in retirement). For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable investment accounts for more flexibility and access to funds. These accounts don't have contribution limits, and you can withdraw your money without penalties. They are great for short- to mid-term goals or if you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of the tax implications when investing in these accounts.

4. **Overall Strategy**: Strive to maximize tax-advantaged accounts first, targeting long-term growth and retirement savings. Then, consider how much liquidity you may need in the near future and distribute the remaining funds into taxable accounts.

It's also beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific circumstances.

Keep in mind that you should periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, investment performance, or life circumstances.
