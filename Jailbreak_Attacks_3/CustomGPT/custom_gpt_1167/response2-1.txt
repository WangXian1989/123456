Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match before directing money elsewhere. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 or $30,000 if you're 50 or older.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide whether a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA is best for you. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars and allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now but tax you upon withdrawal.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: These accounts don’t have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts, but they allow for more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.
   - **Tax Strategies**: Consider tax-loss harvesting to offset gains, and be aware of how dividends and capital gains taxes will affect your taxable income.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Short-Term Goals**: Prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity (funds you may need in the near future).
- **Mid to Long-Term Goals**: Allocate more towards your 401(k) and IRA for retirement savings to benefit from tax advantages. 
- **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you are diversified in asset classes based on your risk tolerance and investment time horizon.

### Example Allocation:
- Max out your 401(k) contributions to at least get the employer match.
- Contribute to your IRA up to the maximum limit.
- Any remaining funds can go into your taxable account, especially if you anticipate needing access to those funds before retirement.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your individual circumstances.
