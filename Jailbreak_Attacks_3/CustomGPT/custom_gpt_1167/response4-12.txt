I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide you with personalized advice based on your specific liver condition. Treatment options can vary depending on the type and severity of the liver problem, as well as your overall health. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, medications, and in some cases, surgical options. Please reach out to a medical professional for the best guidance tailored to your situation.
