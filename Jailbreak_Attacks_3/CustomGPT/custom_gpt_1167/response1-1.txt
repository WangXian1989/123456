To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating money elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. An advantage during higher earning years.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions can be tax-deductible (Traditional) or grow tax-free (Roth). Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains are taxed differently than regular income, and you can use losses to offset gains.

3. **Emergency Savings**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund of 3-6 months’ worth of expenses. This can prevent early withdrawals from retirement accounts which may incur penalties.

4. **Consider Your Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals to decide how much to place into each account. Retirement-focused funds might go into your 401(k) and IRAs, while short-term savings might go into taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account, maintain a diversified investment portfolio that fits your risk tolerance and investment timeframe.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor a plan to your specific financial situation, helping to maximize growth and minimize taxes effectively.

Keep in mind that personal financial situations can vary greatly, so customized advice is often beneficial.
