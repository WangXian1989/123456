Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Emergency Fund:** Before contributing to investment accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months' worth of expenses.

2. **401(k) Contributions:** 
   - If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - Maximize your contributions up to the limit set by the IRS, as contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

3. **IRA Contributions:**
   - Next, consider funding an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation. 
       - Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, which is beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
       - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - Aim to maximize your IRA contributions each year.

4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can invest in taxable accounts.
   - Taxable accounts offer more flexibility and no contribution limits, but keep in mind the tax implications on capital gains and dividends.
   - Focus on investments that generate little to no taxable income, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly evaluate your investment strategy and make adjustments based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals or life circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
