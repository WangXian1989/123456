To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now but tax withdrawals later.

2. **Customize Asset Allocation**:
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**:
     - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
     - Hold higher-taxed investments (such as bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Maintain Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

3. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance as market conditions change.

By strategically distributing your investments and leveraging tax advantages, you can boost your long-term financial growth effectively.
