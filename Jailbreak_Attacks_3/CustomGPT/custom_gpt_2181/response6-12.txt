1. **Medical Management:**
   - **Medications:** Depending on the condition (e.g., Hepatitis, fatty liver disease), specific antiviral or anti-inflammatory medications may be prescribed.
   - **Supplements:** Vitamins and minerals, like Vitamin E, might be recommended for certain liver conditions.

2. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Adopting a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, while avoiding alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - **Check-ups:** Frequent visits to your doctor to monitor liver function through blood tests and imaging studies.
