(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, you might consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize this account to take full advantage, as itâ€™s essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out contributions if possible, as this reduces your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: Consider a traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now, or a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The contribution limits are generally lower than a 401(k), so contribute to this after maximizing your 401(k) benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investing beyond your tax-advantaged accounts. They are more flexible for withdrawals and you can take advantage of capital gains tax rates over ordinary income rates.

Each account has its purpose, so balance your contributions based on your overall retirement strategy and current tax implications.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! The golden rule of distributing your cash is to get that sweet employer match in your 401(k) firstâ€”think of it as free money, and who doesnâ€™t love that? After youâ€™ve snagged that, max out your 401(k) if you can. 

Next, dive into your IRA game. If youâ€™re all about future tax-free withdrawals, a Roth IRA is your jam; otherwise, stick with a traditional one for now and get those deductions. Finally, for anything over that, toss into a taxable account. Those are where you can have some fun with investments without the usual retirement restrictions. Bottom line: play around with all three, but always prioritize where youâ€™re getting the most bang for your buck! Keep it strategic, and youâ€™ll be on track for a killer retirement!
