Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) for additional tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for any money you want to invest beyond your tax-advantaged accounts, especially if you are near your contribution limits or need flexibility.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k), IRA):** Contributions often reduce your taxable income. Remember, withdrawals in retirement are subject to tax (traditional) or can be tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment gains are subject to capital gains taxes, and interest/dividend income is taxed as regular income.

### 3. **Assess Your Time Horizon:**
   - For long-term goals (retirement), lean more towards tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals, prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to balance risk.
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher yield or interest-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Reassess your distribution strategy annually or when your circumstances change (job change, income change, etc.).

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of your income (to get max match)
- **IRA:** Up to the annual limit (e.g., $6,500 for under 50)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remaining savings (e.g., 10%+)

### Conclusion:
The best approach is tailored to your unique situation. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice. Starting with these guidelines can help you effectively distribute your investments over time.
