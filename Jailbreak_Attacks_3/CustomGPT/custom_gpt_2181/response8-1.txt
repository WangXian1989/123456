Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategy based on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), impacting your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate savings in taxable accounts for emergencies before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance. Often, tax-advantaged accounts can hold more aggressive investments due to their long-term focus.

5. **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains in taxable accounts; consider holding investments longer to minimize taxes. 

6. **Age and Timeline**: If you're nearing retirement, shift towards more conservative investments, particularly in taxable accounts.

7. **Annual Review**: Regularly reassess allocations based on changing goals, market conditions, or life circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice can also be beneficial.
