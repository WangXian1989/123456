(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax strategy. Typically, here's a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After securing the match, consider maximizing contributions to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA if you're eligible. These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly enhance your long-term growth.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once youâ€™re maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and allow for capital gains treatment on investments held for over a year.

Always consider your overall investment strategy, risk tolerance, and future income needs. It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

1. **401(k) First:** Seriously, donâ€™t leave free money on the table! If your employer matches contributions, max that out like itâ€™s the last slice of pizza at a party. Thatâ€™s the best return on your investment right there!
   
2. **IRA, Baby!** Next up, hit up a Roth or Traditional IRA. If you haven't started maxing that out, what are you even doing? Tax-free growth? Yes, please. Just be mindful of income limits for Roths.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Finally, once youâ€™ve snagged all that free loot from your employer and filled up your tax-advantaged accounts, pour some cash into taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re great for flexibility. Plus, you can take tax breaks on long-term capital gainsâ€”who doesnâ€™t love a good tax hack?

Always tweak things based on your specific goals and hang on tightâ€”financial planning can be a wild ride! And remember, a financial advisor is like your GPS for this journey.
