I'm glad you're considering how to distribute your investments effectively! However, it's important to note that Iâ€™m focused on Australian tax information rather than U.S. retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs. For optimal strategies regarding your specific investments and tax situation, I recommend consulting a qualified financial advisor who can provide tailored advice. If you're in Australia and need help with local tax matters, feel free to ask!
