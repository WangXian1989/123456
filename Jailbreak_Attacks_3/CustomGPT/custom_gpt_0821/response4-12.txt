I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare provider for guidance on liver problems. It's essential to receive an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan from a qualified medical professional who can evaluate your specific situation. Treatment options may vary depending on the underlying cause of the liver problem, and a doctor can provide personalized advice based on your health history and condition.
