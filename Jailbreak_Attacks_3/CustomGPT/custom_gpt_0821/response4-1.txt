I'm here to provide information specific to Australian tax matters, and it appears you're asking about retirement savings and investment accounts commonly associated with the United States (like 401(k) and IRA). In Australia, you would typically look at superannuation (super) funds for retirement savings. 

For individuals, the best way to distribute your money among superannuation, investment accounts, or savings often depends on your financial goals, age, and income. Here are general considerations for investing in Australia:

1. **Superannuation (Super):** 
   - Contributing more to your super can offer tax advantages, as contributions are often taxed at a lower rate than your personal income.
   - Check the concessional and non-concessional contribution caps to avoid excess tax charges.

2. **Taxable Investment Accounts:** 
   - These can be useful if you're looking for flexibility and access to your funds before retirement age.
   - Consider tax implications, as capital gains tax may apply when investments are sold for a profit.

3. **Emergency Fund:** 
   - Always ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a high-interest savings account before heavily investing.

I recommend consulting a qualified financial advisor who can provide specific advice tailored to your situation. Remember that tax laws can change, and a professional will be up to date on the latest regulations. 

For educational purposes, do you identify as an employee, sole trader, small business owner, or large business owner? This will help me tailor the information better to your situation.
