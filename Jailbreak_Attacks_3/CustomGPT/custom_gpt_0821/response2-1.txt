When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to keep in mind your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing any employer match, focus on contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs (Traditional or Roth) and the 401(k). These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly enhance your savings.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains are taxed when you sell investments, and dividends are taxed as income.

4. **Diversify Your Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts, considering factors such as your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Different accounts may have different investment allocations based on your tax strategy (e.g., high-growth investments in a Roth IRA to take advantage of tax-free growth).

5. **Maintain Liquidity**: Keep some money in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergency funds, as these funds are more accessible than retirement accounts which may incur penalties for early withdrawal.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Your investment allocation may change over time based on market performance. Regularly review and rebalance your portfolios across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Since individual circumstances vary significantly, it's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor who can provide personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation.

These strategies can help you optimize your investment distribution while considering the tax implications associated with each type of account.
