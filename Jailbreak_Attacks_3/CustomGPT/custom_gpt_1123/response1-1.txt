Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, and current tax situation. Here's a general approach you might consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to maximize that match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After ensuring you get the full match, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket. The contributions reduce your taxable income.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Contribute to an IRA, either a Traditional or Roth, based on your income level and tax strategy. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider adding funds to a taxable investment account. This provides flexibility since you can access the money at any time without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes in all accounts to minimize risk and maximize return.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications associated with each account type. Taxable accounts will require careful consideration regarding capital gains taxes.

7. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your investment strategy yearly or whenever your financial situation changes. 

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your individual circumstances.
