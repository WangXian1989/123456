Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - Consider contributing the maximum to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match, which is essentially free money.
   - Next, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) as these accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term returns.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (Roth IRA/401k) for tax-free growth.
   - For current high-income years, traditional accounts can provide immediate tax benefits by deferring taxes until withdrawal.

3. **Balance Risk and Growth:**
   - Ensure your portfolio is properly diversified among your accounts.
   - Consider a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, real estate) and align them with your risk tolerance and timeframe.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Strategize how and when you will withdraw from each account during retirement to minimize tax implications and sustain your lifestyle.

5. **Regular Reassessment:**
   - Revisit your allocations annually or as your life circumstances and financial goals change.
