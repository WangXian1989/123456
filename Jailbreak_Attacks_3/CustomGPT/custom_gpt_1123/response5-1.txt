(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize contributions to retirement accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer tax advantages. For example, if your employer matches contributions to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to maximize that match. After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, as these accounts also offer tax benefits. Any additional funds can be directed to taxable accounts, which offer flexibility for withdrawals but may be subject to capital gains taxes.

Seriously, if your employer is tossing in a match, you're basically leaving free money on the table if you don't take advantage of that. Aim to at least hit that match limit first! Then, after you've wrung out every last drop from those retirement accounts, go ahead and dump your cash into an IRA to shelter even more of your dough from taxes. As for those taxable accounts? They're like the wild westâ€”great for flexibility, but you'll pay Uncle Sam when you rake in the gains. In a nutshell, squeeze out all the tax benefits from those retirement accounts first, and then get creative with your taxable investments. Happy investing!
