To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Define your short-term and long-term financial goals. Determine how much you need for retirement, major purchases, or emergencies.

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, which can be Traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts where you pay taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains.

3. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Prioritize the 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - If you can contribute more, assess whether to fund a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your current and expected future tax bracket.
   - Consider adding to your taxable account once you have maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Stocks generally provide higher potential returns but with more volatility, while bonds are more stable.
   - Adjust your asset mix across accounts according to their tax implications.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Keep tax-inefficient investments (like REITs or high-yield bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.
   - Use your taxable account for tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).

6. **Monitor and Rebalance**: Regularly review your portfolioâ€™s performance and asset allocation. Rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consider Professional Advice**: Consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your financial situation and goals.

By following these steps, you can strategically distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize growth and minimize tax liabilities.
