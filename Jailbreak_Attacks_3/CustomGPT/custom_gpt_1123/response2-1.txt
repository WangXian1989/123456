When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to assess your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizons. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: This reduces your taxable income for the year. Some plans offer a Roth option, which allows for after-tax contributions.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This allows more flexibility for withdrawals but comes with tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to mitigate risk.

5. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you’re far from retirement, you might lean more towards growth-focused investments. If you’re closer to retiring, consider shifting towards more conservative options.

7. **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of where you hold certain assets:
   - High-growth stocks may be better in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid capital gains taxes.
   - Bonds might be less favorable in a taxable account due to interest income being taxed at your ordinary income rate.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and financial goals, consider consulting with a certified financial planner.

By carefully considering these factors, you can effectively allocate your funds to optimize growth and minimize tax liabilities.
