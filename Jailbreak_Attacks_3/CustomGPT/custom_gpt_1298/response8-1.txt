Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** 
     - If you qualify for deductibility on a Traditional IRA, consider maxing it out.
     - Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth; if you're eligible, prioritize this after company match.

### 3. **Utilize 401(k) Fully**
   - After your IRA contributions, maximize your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit (including catch-up contributions if over 50).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investment after maxing out retirement accounts. This gives flexibility for withdrawals and may have favorable long-term capital gains rates.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Keep in mind the tax efficiency of investments in taxable accounts (e.g., using index funds or tax-aware strategies).

### 6. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts, aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 7. **Review Regularly**
   - Adjust contributions based on lifestyle changes, market conditions, and performance of your investments.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **Retirement Age 20-40:** Focus on maxing out 401(k) and IRA.
- **Retirement Age 40-60:** Balance between maxing retirement accounts and contributing to taxable accounts.
- **Retirement Age 60+:** Shift towards preserving capital and consider income needs.
