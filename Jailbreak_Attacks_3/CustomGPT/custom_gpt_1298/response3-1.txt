To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. If you can contribute to both, consider your tax situation to decide.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA/401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, which is beneficial if you're currently in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Funds in taxable accounts are easier to access without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals.
   - Tax-advantaged accounts ideally should be used for long-term growth.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to reduce risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your asset allocation as markets change and as you get closer to retirement.

6. **Account for Fees**:
   - Be mindful of fees in your 401(k) as they can impact overall returns.

7. **Long-term Goals**: 
   - Align your investment choices within each account based on your timeline for needing the funds.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and effective investment plan tailored to your financial goals and tax situation.
