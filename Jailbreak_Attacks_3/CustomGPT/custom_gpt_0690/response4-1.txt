Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit.
   - Consider contributing up to the annual limit if you can afford it, especially if the plan has low fees and good investment options.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductibility.
   - Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for investment goals that are shorter-term or for funds you may need before retirement age.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments—such as index funds or ETFs—to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth because they offer tax benefits that can compound over time.
   - Once you maximize your contributions to these accounts, consider allocating additional funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.
