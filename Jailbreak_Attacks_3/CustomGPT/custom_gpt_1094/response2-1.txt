Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to capitalize on any employer match, as this is "free money." Aim to contribute up to the annual limit if possible, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA (if eligible). The Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - In higher tax brackets, prioritize pre-tax accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) to reduce current taxable income.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, Roth accounts might be more beneficial.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k)**: Generally offers limited investment options; choose a diversified mix of funds (stocks, bonds, etc.) that fits your risk tolerance and timeline.
   - **IRA**: Typically offers a wider range of investment choices; add assets that may not be available in your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate long-term capital gains (e.g., stocks held for over a year) for favorable tax treatment. Consider municipal bonds for tax-free income.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Before allocating all your funds to retirement accounts, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid, accessible account.

### 5. **Periodic Review and Rebalance**
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level. 

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation, goals, and needs.

This approach helps you benefit from tax advantages while also considering your long-term financial goals.
