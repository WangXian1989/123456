Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, timeline, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially "free money." This account has higher contribution limits than IRAs, allowing for significant growth on a tax-deferred basis.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free. Depending on your income, you may not be eligible for direct contributions to a Roth, so understand your options.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider taxable investment accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals but may be subject to capital gains taxes. Focus on investing in low-turnover index funds or ETFs to minimize tax implications.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get full employer matching.
- **Max out IRA Contributions**: Contribute to an IRA after the employer match and consider Roth options.
- **Taxable Accounts for Extra**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings, especially if you expect short-term needs.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
