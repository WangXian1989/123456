Balancing your investments across different account types is crucial for long-term financial health. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of strategies for distributing your money:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **High-Interest Debt**: Consider paying off high-interest debt before investing significant amounts.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Aim to maximize your contributions (the limit is $22,500 for 2023; $30,000 if you're over 50). Focus on this for long-term growth and tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA (limit is $6,500 for 2023; $7,500 if over 50). Choose a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maxing out the above tax-advantaged options, allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts. This is useful for short-term goals or as an early-access option without penalties.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Invest in a mixture of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor tax-efficient investments (like ETFs or stocks) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider income-producing investments like municipal bonds, which are often tax-exempt.

### 5. **Rebalance Annually:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your investment allocation to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
