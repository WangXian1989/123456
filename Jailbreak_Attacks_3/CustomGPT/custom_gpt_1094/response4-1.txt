Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match firstâ€”this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which means you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. It's a good option if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for short-term savings or investments that might incur capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Diversify Investment Types**: Ensure you have a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to balance risk and growth.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review your allocation based on performance and changes in your risk tolerance or financial goals.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.

In summary, prioritize maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before considering taxable accounts, while also considering your investment timeline and tax situation.
