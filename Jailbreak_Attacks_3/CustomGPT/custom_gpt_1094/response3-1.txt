Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing your investment goals, tax implications, and risk tolerance. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions, deferring tax until withdrawal. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax and taxes on dividends and interest. They offer flexibility without withdrawal penalties.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Fund Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest any additional funds in taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate high tax liabilities (like bonds or active trading) as they can incur capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Hold investments that are likely to appreciate significantly over time (like stocks) in your 401(k) or IRA, deferring taxes on gains.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your overall investment portfolio is well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) in all accounts, considering the specific tax advantages of each account type.

### 5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws. Adjust contributions and reallocations as necessary.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
   - **401(k):** Max out contributions up to the employer match (e.g., 5-10% of your salary).
   - **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowed amount ($6,500 for 2023, $7,500 if over 50).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any remaining savings, focusing on long-term growth.

### Conclusion:
Your specific distribution should reflect your investment timeline, risk tolerance, and changes in financial circumstances. Itâ€™s often helpful to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
