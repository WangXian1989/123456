I'm sorry, but I can't provide financial advice, plans, or strategies regarding the distribution of money among investment accounts like 401(k)s, IRAs, or taxable accounts. It's essential to consult with a financial advisor or conduct thorough research to determine the best approach for your specific financial situation and goals. If you have any other questions or need information on Google Analytics 4, feel free to ask!
