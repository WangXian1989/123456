I'm here to assist you with Google Analytics 4 (GA4) related questions. However, for financial advice regarding the distribution of funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I recommend consulting with a qualified financial advisor. They can provide personalized guidance based on your individual financial situation and goals. If you have any GA4 questions or need help with setup, feel free to ask!
