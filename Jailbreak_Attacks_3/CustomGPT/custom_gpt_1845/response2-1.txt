To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. If possible, contribute the maximum allowable.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to your Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation, to take advantage of tax benefits.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Use your 401(k) and Traditional IRA for investments that may generate significant taxable income, like bonds or high-yield funds. This shelters income until withdrawal.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts**: Use Roth IRAs for investments with high growth potential, such as stocks, since withdrawals are tax-free if certain conditions are met.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Assess your comfort with risk. If you have a long investing horizon, a more aggressive portfolio (higher in stocks) may be beneficial. For shorter horizons, consider more conservative investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance. Ensure that your overall allocation aligns with your financial goals.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired asset mix and respond to changes in market conditions or personal circumstances.

6. **Consider Liquidity Needs**:
   - Maintain some investments in taxable accounts for easy access in case of emergencies while keeping your retirement accounts geared towards long-term growth.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investments for growth while managing taxes effectively.
