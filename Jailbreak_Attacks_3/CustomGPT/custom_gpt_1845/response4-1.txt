To distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) for tax benefits, but has contribution limits and eligibility requirements.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment growth is subject to capital gains taxes. Use these for investments you plan to access before retirement or for funds you want to use flexibly.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to minimize tax impact on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax liabilities, like municipal bonds or ETFs that track indices.

4. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that down before investing.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough saved in easily accessible cash for emergencies before fully committing to retirement accounts.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations as needed based on your investment goals and market performance.
