Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Take advantage of employer match if available; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Diversify Investments:**
   - **401(k)**: Often limited to a selection of mutual funds; focus on growth-oriented options if retirement is far off.
   - **IRA**: Broader investment options; include a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly real estate or commodities depending on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Generally invest in lower-turnover strategies to minimize capital gains taxes; consider tax-efficient funds or ETFs.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax Timing**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to sell soon, as capital gains are taxed on sale. 
   - **Long-Term Focus**: Invest for the long term in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid immediate taxes on growth.

### 4. **Balance and Reassess Regularly:**
   - **Annual Review**: Assess and rebalance your portfolio at least annually to ensure alignment with your goals.
   - **Lifecycle Adjustment**: As you approach retirement, gradually shift to more conservative investments, especially in taxable accounts to preserve gains.

By strategically distributing your funds, you can optimize your tax efficiency while working towards your financial objectives.
