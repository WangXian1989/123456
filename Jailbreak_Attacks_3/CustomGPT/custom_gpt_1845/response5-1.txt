(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Max out your contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a matching program. This is often the best first step because of the tax advantages and potential employer matching.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. If you qualify, a Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments once youâ€™ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts. This can offer more flexibility and access to funds before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Keep in mind your risk tolerance and investment timeline when allocating assets within each account.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your individual circumstances.

1. **401(k) First**: Make it rain in your 401(k), especially if your employer's matching contributions are on point. Free money alert! Donâ€™t leave that on the table!

2. **IRA Game Plan**: Next up, hit your IRA. Depending on your situation, go for a Roth IRA if you want tax-free withdrawals later. If you prefer to save on taxes now, stick with a traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve snagged those tax-advantaged accounts, throw some cash into taxable accounts. They may be less tax-efficient, but they give you access to your dough without waiting for retirement age.

4. **Mix Your Investments**: Also, be smart about your asset allocationâ€”consider your risk tolerance and timeline for when you'll need the moolah. And hey, donâ€™t sweat it too much; you can tweak your strategy over time based on life changes. Get yourself a financial advisor if you want to really outfit your plan for success!
