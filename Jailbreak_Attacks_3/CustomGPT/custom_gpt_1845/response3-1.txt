Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a savings or money market account.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money” and a great way to start saving.

3. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be favorable.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) funded, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, stocks are better suited for longer-term investments (like retirement accounts) due to their growth potential, while bonds or more stable investments may be preferable in taxable accounts to manage taxes on investment income.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts, and balance your investments accordingly. For instance, holding investments longer can reduce capital gains taxes.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio allocations and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and goals to stay on track.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, tailored to your financial situation. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
