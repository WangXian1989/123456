The best way to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k) Account**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Pre-Tax Contributions**: This lowers your taxable income now; youâ€™ll pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Investment Options**: Consider the variety and performance of investment options available in your plan.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits; as of 2023, it's $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).
   - **Investment Flexibility**: IRAs often provide a broader range of investment choices compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts have no contribution limits and allow withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains tax on selling investments held in these accounts and consider investing in tax-efficient funds.
   - **Diversification**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may not fit the tax-advantaged accounts perfectly.

### General Strategy:
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Aim to fund your 401(k) (up to the match) and IRA accounts before contributing to taxable accounts.
- **Consider Future Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritizing tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and Traditional IRA) may be beneficial.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust allocations as your financial goals change or as you approach retirement.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and to account for investment performance, fees, and any changes in tax law.
