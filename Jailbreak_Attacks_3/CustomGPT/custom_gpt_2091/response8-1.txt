Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After the match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if you're eligible.

3. **Prioritize Debt Repayment**:
   - If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that off before making significant contributions to investment accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement. They can be more flexible but may be subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account, focusing on growth in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts might be wise. Conversely, if you expect lower taxes, traditional accounts could be more beneficial.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Monitor your accounts and investment performance regularly and adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Itâ€™s advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies specifically to your needs.
