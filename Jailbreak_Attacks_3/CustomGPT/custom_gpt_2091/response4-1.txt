To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and future plans.

2. **Prioritize Contributions Based on Tax Treatment**:
   - Use your **401(k)** for pre-tax contributions if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - Choose a **Roth IRA** if you anticipate higher taxes in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Use **taxable accounts** for funds you may need before retirement age or to maintain flexibility.

3. **Consider Investment Options**:
   - 401(k) accounts may have limited investment choices; ensure your options align with your overall investment strategy.
   - IRAs typically offer a broader range of investment options, which can be advantageous for growth.

4. **Assess Your Financial Goals**:
   - Short-term savings may be more suitable in taxable accounts, while long-term growth should be prioritized in retirement accounts.

5. **Beware of Withdrawal Rules**:
   - Understand the penalties and tax implications of withdrawals from your 401(k) and IRA, especially before age 59Â½.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your asset allocation across accounts periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation and goals.
