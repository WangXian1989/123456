To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: If it's a traditional IRA, similar benefits apply. If it's a Roth IRA, contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on capital gains and dividends. Consider using them for investments that generate capital gains rather than ordinary income to minimize taxes.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher growth investments (like stocks) since they benefit more from tax advantages.
   - Use your taxable account for investments that produce higher dividends or interest, as these will be taxed.

4. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors might favor aggressive growth strategies in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - As you approach retirement, consider shifting toward more stable investments to protect your capital.

5. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of the contribution limits for each account type to ensure you're maximizing your investment potential while adhering to regulations.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**:
   - Review your allocations and investment performance annually and adjust based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation and goals, consider consulting a financial advisor.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced and effective approach to managing your investments across different types of accounts.
