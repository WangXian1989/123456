Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free” money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**:
   - If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings if you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA. These funds can be accessed without penalties before retirement age, offering greater flexibility.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxable income.
   - Invest tax-efficient funds or stocks in taxable accounts, as they often attract lower capital gains taxes.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investments and adjust based on market conditions, your risk tolerance, and life changes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Make sure to align your distribution strategy with your long-term financial goals!
