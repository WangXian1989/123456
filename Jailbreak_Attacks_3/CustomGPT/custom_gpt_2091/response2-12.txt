   - **Corticosteroids/Immunosuppressants:** For autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Routine blood tests to monitor liver function and assess the progression of liver disease.

4. **Lifestyle Support:**

   - **Hydration:** Drinking plenty of water supports liver health.

5. **Surgery or Procedures:**
