The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Afterward, consider maximizing contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax considerations.
  
2. **Tax Efficient Investing**:
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (e.g., high-turnover funds, bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid capital gains taxes in your taxable accounts.
   - Keep more tax-efficient investments (e.g., stocks, index funds) in your taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you need money in the short term, keep that in your taxable account to avoid penalties on early withdrawals from retirement accounts.
   - For long-term goals, prioritize funding your tax-advantaged accounts as they grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an accessible emergency fund before maximizing contributions.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall asset allocation is diversified across all accounts to balance risk and return based on your financial goals.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocation based on performance, changing financial situations, or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
