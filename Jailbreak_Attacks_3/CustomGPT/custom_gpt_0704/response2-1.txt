Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can maximize your retirement savings while minimizing taxes. Here’s a strategy to consider:

1. **Max Out Employer Matches**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantage Accounts**:
   - **Max Out IRA**: If you qualify for a Traditional or Roth IRA, consider maxing it out next. IRAs typically have lower fees and offer tax advantages.
   - **Contribute to 401(k)**: After maxing out the IRA, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve optimized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest additional funds in taxable accounts. This provides flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts may have capital gains taxes when you sell investments, so focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds).
   - **IRAs and 401(k)s**: Growth in these accounts is tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth). Plan withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Your financial situation and goals can change. Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions as necessary.

7. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**: The closer you get to retirement, the more you might want to shift towards safer investments in your 401(k) and IRA.

By balancing these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money across these accounts to optimize your financial growth and prepare for retirement.
