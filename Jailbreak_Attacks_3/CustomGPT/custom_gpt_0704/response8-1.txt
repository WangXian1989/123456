The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowed, especially if you get a match.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in a taxable account. This can provide more flexibility for accessing funds, but understand that you’ll be subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Consider Fund Types**: In taxable accounts, lean towards tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs, which generally have lower turnover rates and thus incur fewer taxes.

5. **Risk Tolerance and Investment Allocation**:
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts that matches your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If your situation is complex, consider speaking with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan.

Remember to review your financial situation regularly as life circumstances and tax laws change.
