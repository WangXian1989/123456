Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to max out contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money." Then consider maximizing your IRA contributions.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met). Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. Consider holding stocks and funds that produce qualified dividends or appreciate in long-term capital gain for tax efficiency.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider keeping more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to shelter them from taxes.
   - Use more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact and manage distributions.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified, regardless of the account type. Consider factors like risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals.

5. **Regular Review**: Monitor and adjust your allocations as your financial situation, market conditions, and goals change.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
