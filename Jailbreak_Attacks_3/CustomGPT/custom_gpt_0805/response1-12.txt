I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you talk to a healthcare professional about your liver problem. They can offer personalized advice based on your specific condition. Treatment options may vary widely depending on the nature of the liver issue, so it's important to get professional guidance. Keep up with any lifestyle changes they recommend, such as diet or exercise, to support liver health!
