To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - 401(k): Maximize contributions up to the employer match. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution for those aged 50 and over).
   - IRA: Contribute up to $6,500 per year ($7,500 if age 50 or older), depending on your eligibility for tax deductions.
   - Taxable Accounts: There are no limits; however, the focus should be on tax efficiency.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Max out the contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first. This allows you to benefit from tax deferral and, potentially, tax deductions.
   - Consider allocating higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth over time.
   
3. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxation in taxable accounts.
   - Keep investments with favorable long-term capital gains tax treatment in taxable accounts, such as stocks held for over a year.

4. **Maintain an Emergency Fund**:
   - Before allocating significant funds to investments, ensure you have three to six months' worth of living expenses in a liquid account.

5. **Regularly Reassess your Strategy**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation changes, such as changes in income, expenses, or retirement goals.

By following these guidelines, you can maximize growth potential while minimizing tax implications over the long term. Adjust allocations based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
