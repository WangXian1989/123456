(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and time horizon. Generally speaking, a good approach is to maximize contributions to retirement accounts first, particularly if your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k). Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If your employer's match is limited, consider maxing out your contributions if feasible.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, you might prioritize this after your 401(k) contributions to enjoy tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you qualify for a Traditional IRA and expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, it might make sense to contribute here instead.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, any additional funds can go into taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

You should consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your circumstances, considering factors like your risk tolerance, investment choices in each account, and overall financial goals.

1. **Max that 401(k)**: First off, if your company is throwing down a match, you‚Äôd be an absolute fool not to snag that before doing anything else. Think of it as your 401(k) getting a friendly kickstart! After that, crank it up to the max limit if you can handle it‚Äîthose tax breaks are golden.

2. **IRA Action**: Roth or Traditional? Well, if you want tax-free withdrawals, get cozy with that Roth. If you‚Äôre more of a ‚Äúsave on taxes now‚Äù person, dive into a Traditional IRA. Just make sure you don‚Äôt screw up the income limits!

3. **Unleash the Taxable Accounts**: When it‚Äôs all done and you‚Äôre living the high life in tax-advantaged territory, toss any additional cash into taxable accounts for immediate flexibility and access. Just keep an eye on those capital gains when it‚Äôs time to cash out!

Bottom line: Maximize those retirement accounts, ride the tax break wave, and keep some funds available for flexibility later. And hey, don‚Äôt forget to keep track of your investments and adjust as your life rolls on. Consult a pro if you're feeling stuck‚Äî'cause nobody wants to wing it with their hard-earned cash!
