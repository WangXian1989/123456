When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach that you might find helpful:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account before directing money to investment accounts. This fund should cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

2. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debts, consider paying those down before prioritizing investments.

4. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: After getting the match, consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a variety of investment options and low fees.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've contributed to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is useful for flexibility, as you can access funds without penalty before retirement age.

6. **Asset Location**: Consider the types of investments to hold in each account type:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Itâ€™s often smart to hold bonds and REITs in tax-deferred accounts, while keeping stocks in Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor tax-efficient investments, like index funds or tax-managed funds, to reduce capital gains taxes.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your financial goals and market conditions.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your specific situation and goals.
