When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to evaluate your financial goals, tax situations, and time horizon for using the funds. Here are some general steps to guide you:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**: Define your short-term and long-term financial objectives. Are you saving for retirement, a major purchase, or an emergency fund?

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Usually offered by employers, contributions are often tax-deferred. Employer match programs should not be overlooked as they provide ‘free money.’
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts come in traditional or Roth options. Contributions to traditional IRAs may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These allow for flexible access to funds without penalties but are subject to capital gains taxes on investments.

3. **Prioritize Contributions**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is an immediate return on your investment.
   - After that, consider maximizing your IRA contributions to take advantage of tax benefits.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification and Investment Strategies**: Diversify your investments within each account to minimize risk. Allocate assets based on your risk tolerance, age, and investment timeline.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of how withdrawals may be taxed in the future. Consider the impact of required minimum distributions (RMDs) from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs starting at age 72.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your goals or financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your personal circumstances.
