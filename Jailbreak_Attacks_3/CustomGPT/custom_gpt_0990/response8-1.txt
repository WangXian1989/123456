Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is essentially "free money" and should be a priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If you qualify, consider fully funding a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions reduce your taxable income now, while withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - Roth IRA contributions do not provide immediate tax deduction benefits, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts do not have tax advantages but offer flexibility and may have different tax treatment on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Balance Risk and Growth**:
   - Diversify your investments within these accounts based on your risk tolerance. Aim for a mix of stocks and bonds that aligns with your time horizon and financial goals.

5. **Consider Withdrawals and Timing**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize taxes. For instance, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor. They can help optimize your investment strategy and tax efficiency.

In summary, prioritize employer matching in your 401(k), consider fully funding an IRA, and use taxable accounts strategically, keeping in mind the tax implications of each.
