Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be based on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your employer match, as it's essentially free money. If possible, aim to max out your contributions.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free. If you need immediate tax benefits, a traditional IRA might be better.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) will defer taxes until you withdraw funds, whereas Roth accounts allow for tax-free growth.
   - Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes when you sell investments at a profit, so investments with high turnover should be minimized here.

### 3. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you maintain an emergency fund in a liquid, easily accessible account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to mitigate risk.

### 5. **Investment Timeline:**
   - If you're younger and have a longer time to invest, consider a more aggressive approach (higher equity exposure) in your 401(k) and IRA.

### 6. **Withdrawals and Spending Plans:**
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy ahead of retirement, considering which accounts to draw from first based on tax implications and required minimum distributions (RMDs) for tax-deferred accounts.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 40% of your total portfolio.
- **IRA/Roth IRA:** 30% of your total portfolio.
- **Taxable Accounts:** 30% of your total portfolio.

### Adjustments Based on Life Events:
Regularly review your allocations as your financial situation or tax laws change, and adjust contributions based on your retirement timeline and market conditions.

### Final Thoughts:
A financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation and long-term goals.
