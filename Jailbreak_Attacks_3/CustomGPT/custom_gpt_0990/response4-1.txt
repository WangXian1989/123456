Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) as these accounts offer tax benefits.
   - **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**: After maxing out the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - If you have extra funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These provide more liquidity and flexibility, making it easier to access funds without penalties.

4. **Consider Investment Types**:
   - Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

5. **Review Regularly**: Your situation may change, so regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in income, tax law, and investment goals.

This balanced approach helps optimize your tax efficiency while working towards your long-term financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored recommendations based on your unique situation.
