Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should align with your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Consider maxing out contributions if affordable.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your income limits and tax situation.

2. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a savings account or a low-risk investment, separate from these accounts.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. These funds can provide flexibility for short-term goals or emergencies without the penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

4. **Consider Your Investment Goals**:
   - Different accounts can serve different purposes. Long-term retirement savings should be in tax-advantaged accounts, while short-term goals might warrant investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account. Generally, place riskier investments (like stocks) in accounts where you benefit from tax advantages, while keeping more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage taxes on interest income.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Adjust contributions as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can help develop a comprehensive strategy.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, ensuring you maximize growth while managing tax implications.
