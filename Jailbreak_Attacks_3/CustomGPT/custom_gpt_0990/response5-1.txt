Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) over taxable accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether itâ€™s a Traditional or Roth IRA, you can benefit from tax deferrals or tax-free growth.

3. **Diversification**: Within each account, diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Consider the tax implications of withdrawing funds from each account type. Withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts are typically taxed as income.
   - Taxable accounts might incur capital gains taxes on profits, so consider holding assets long-term to minimize taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity for emergencies before maxing out retirement accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
