Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your income and tax situation, consider contributing to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as income during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with post-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment income (interest, dividends, and capital gains) is taxed in the year it is realized, which can impact your overall tax burden.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for long-term, higher-growth investments (like stocks) because they benefit more from tax deferral.
   - Consider more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they may produce interest income that is taxed at your ordinary income tax rate.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Set aside sufficient funds in liquid assets outside of retirement accounts to cover emergency expenses.

### 5. **Personal Goals and Risk Tolerance**
   - Assess your risk tolerance and time horizon to determine the right asset allocation across all accounts. Longer time horizons can typically withstand more market volatility.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation according to market performance and changes in your life circumstances.

### Sample Distribution Strategy
- **Emergency Fund:** 3-6 months of expenses in a savings account.
- **401(k):** Maximize employer match, then contribute to the limit.
- **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA.
- **Taxable Account:** Any additional savings can go here, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

This approach helps ensure you're making the most of tax benefits while also preparing for a secure financial future. Always consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
