Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax bracket, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket. Consider the pre-tax option for immediate tax benefits.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After funding your retirement accounts, you can invest any additional savings in taxable accounts. Use this for flexible, short-term goals or if you have maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**: Consider the types of investments:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or eliminate taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically involve fewer capital gains taxes.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your investments and adjust as needed based on market conditions and your personal situation. 

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, it’s best to consult a financial advisor.

This balanced approach will help you optimize your retirement savings and investment growth while managing your tax implications effectively.
