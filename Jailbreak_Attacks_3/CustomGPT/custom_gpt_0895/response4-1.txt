Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, consider prioritizing a Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are taxed on capital gains and dividends. These accounts offer flexibility but are less tax-advantaged.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that are expected to grow significantly (like stocks) since the tax impact is deferred or eliminated.
   - Consider bonds or stable investments in taxable accounts as they might generate taxable interest.

4. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a separate savings account before heavily investing in these accounts.

5. **Ongoing Contributions:** Distribute your ongoing contributions based on your retirement timeline and goals, adjusting for any changes in income, expenses, or tax laws.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Monitor and rebalance your investments across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Professional:** It may be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and long-term goals.

This approach helps ensure you're making the most tax-efficient decisions while working towards your financial objectives.
