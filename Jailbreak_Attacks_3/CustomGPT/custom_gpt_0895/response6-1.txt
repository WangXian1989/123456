Distributing your money among different types of accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, consider maxing out your contributions.
   - **IRA:** After maxing out the 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement age. This can include stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
   - Consider placing investments in taxable accounts that receive favorable tax treatment, such as qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Place tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient assets (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### Implementation Steps:
- **Review Contribution Limits:** Check annual limits for 401(k) and IRA contributions.
- **Assess Risk Tolerance:** Determine how much risk you are comfortable taking with your investments.
- **Monitor and Adjust:** Regularly review your asset distribution and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
