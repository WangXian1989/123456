Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **Traditional IRA/401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deductible. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize these accounts. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, as they are more tax-efficient for long-term investing. 

4. **Debt Management**: 
   - Pay down high-interest debt before heavily investing. Consider your overall debt situation when allocating funds.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have savings set aside in a liquid account for emergencies before maximizing retirement contributions.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments within each account. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

7. **Regular Review**: 
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Maximize to employer match + additional contributions based on your current income.
- **IRA**: Maximize contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on income limits and tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest leftover funds, focusing on long-term growth investments.

Adjust the allocations based on priorities, tax implications, and retirement timeline.
