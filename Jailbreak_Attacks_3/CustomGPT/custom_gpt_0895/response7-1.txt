Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions and tax advantages. Contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Offers tax advantages. Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax on earnings but offer more flexibility for withdrawing funds without penalties.

### 2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, especially if you have employer matching.
   - **Use taxable accounts for flexible investments**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that may generate lower immediate tax burdens.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **Invest according to risk tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your age, risk tolerance, and when you plan to retire.
   - **Rebalance across accounts**: Maintain your desired allocation by rebalancing funds among your accounts periodically.

### 4. **Future Tax Bracket Consideration**
   - **Tax implications in retirement**: Consider withdrawing from tax-deferred accounts in low-income years to minimize tax exposure.
   - **Roth conversions**: If anticipating higher future tax rates, consider converting funds from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.

### 5. **Emergency Funds**
   - **Maintain liquidity**: Ensure you have enough cash in a high-yield savings account or taxable account for emergencies.

### Example Distribution Approach:
1. **Max out 401(k)** contributions to capture employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**, prioritizing a Roth IRA if eligible (for future tax-free withdrawals).
3. **Invest in taxable accounts** as needed for additional funds once other accounts are maxed out.

### Adjust as Needed:
Review your investment strategy regularly and adjust based on financial goals, market conditions, and changes in income or expenses.
