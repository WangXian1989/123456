(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depend on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating funds elsewhere.
  
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA ($7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Investment Goals**: Consider your investment goals. If you're saving for retirement, prioritize these accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged contributions, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts, especially if you need liquidity or want to invest in assets that may not be suitable for tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Adjust your investment strategy based on the account type. Generally, hold higher-risk assets in tax-advantaged accounts due to their growth potential.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! The best way to juggle your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts really depends on your goals and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a no-nonsense approach:

1. **Get That Free Money**: First things first, make sure you're snagging that employer match in your 401(k). It's basically free money, so donâ€™t leave it on the table!

2. **Tax Shelters FTW**: Next up, pump cash into your 401(k) and IRA like it's hot. For 2023, that means $22,500 in your 401(k) and $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're older) in your IRA. Stack those contributions!

3. **Short vs. Long Term**: Think about what youâ€™re saving for. If you're in it for the long haul (retirement), max those tax-advantaged accounts. Keep that sweet compounding interest working for you!

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve hit those limits, see what's left for taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re great for flexibility and easy access when you need cash, but just be careful with those taxes when you start taking profits.

5. **Mix It Up**: As for investments, toss riskier assets into your tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without the IRS breathing down your neck. Play smart with what goes where!

So, there you have it! Get that balance right and watch your wealth grow!
