Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach to consider for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match; this is essentially free money.
- **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Since contributions are made pre-tax, prioritize this account for investments that you believe will grow substantially over time.
- **Investment Choices**: Check the available investment options in your 401(k) and ensure they align with your long-term strategy.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Tax Considerations**: If your income qualifies for a Roth IRA and you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth contributions for tax-free growth. In contrast, a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now, which may be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket later.
- **Contribution Limits**: Take advantage of the maximum annual contribution limits to these accounts.
- **Diversification**: Use your IRA to invest in a diversified portfolio that may offer a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets not available in your 401(k).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Access and Flexibility**: Taxable accounts can be used for short-term goals or emergencies since they don’t have restrictions on withdrawals.
- **Investment Types**: Consider holding investments with preferable long-term capital gains treatment, like stocks, in your taxable account. Avoid interest-generating investments here that could lead to higher annual tax liabilities.
- **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Use tax-managed funds or tax-efficient strategies to minimize your tax burden in this account.

### General Strategy
- **Balance Your Investments**: A diversified approach across all three accounts can help reduce risk and optimize for potential returns.
- **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and adjust your allocations based on performance, lifestyle changes, and financial goals.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's wise to consult with a financial professional who can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Ultimately, your allocation should reflect your unique financial picture, including your goals, timeline, and risk tolerance.
