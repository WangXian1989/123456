Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic planning based on your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here's a general guide:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential matching contributions. Offers tax-deferred growth, meaning you won't pay taxes on contributions or earnings until withdrawal during retirement.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages for retirement savings. Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts that donâ€™t offer tax advantages. You pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains. They provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - Maximize any employer match in your 401(k) first. It's free money!
   - Next, consider contributing to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income and tax situation.
   - After maximizing these tax-advantaged accounts, invest in your taxable account for additional flexibility.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA** contributions may lower your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions may be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts can be suitable for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates.

### 4. **Investment Choices**
   - Within your 401(k) and IRAs, consider a diversified mix of assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.) that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs that generally have lower turnover.

### 5. **Rebalancing and Monitoring**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in your taxable accounts, and try to hold onto assets for more than a year to benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 6. **Consulting a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor to help tailor a distribution strategy that fits your specific financial situation and goals.

### Conclusion
The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on your individual circumstances, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Balancing contributions while considering tax implications and investment choices can help you build a robust financial future.
