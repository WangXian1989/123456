Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategically considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some steps to guide you:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: First, be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if aged 50 or older).

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. However, you pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **IRAs**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax and dividends, so the tax efficiency of your investments is crucial.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of the account type. This helps manage risk.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you're investing for long-term goals (like retirement), you might lean towards more aggressive investments in your retirement accounts, whereas more conservative investments might be better in a taxable account if you expect to need the funds sooner.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your investments at least annually to ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

7. **Emergency Fund and Debt**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund and have addressed any high-interest debt, as these can hinder your financial progress.

Every individual's financial situation is unique, so consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your goals.
