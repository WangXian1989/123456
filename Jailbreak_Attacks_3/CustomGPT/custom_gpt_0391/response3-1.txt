Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Debt Consideration**:
   - Pay off high-interest debt first, as it often outweighs investment returns.

3. **Build an Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months’ worth of expenses saved in a high-yield savings account before heavily investing.

4. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the maximum allowed. It's tax-deferred growth and reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Aim to maximize contributions here, especially if your income allows it.
   
5. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that generate lower tax liabilities (like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs). This space allows for flexibility to withdraw without penalties.

6. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Adjust your investment mix based on your risk tolerance and how far you are from retirement. Younger investors might favor growth-focused investments, while those closer to retirement may prefer more stability.

7. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments within each account are diversified to mitigate risk.

8. **Periodic Review**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.
