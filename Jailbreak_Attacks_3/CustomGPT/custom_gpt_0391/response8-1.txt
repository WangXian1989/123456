Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**:
   - After maxing out the IRA, increase contributions to your 401(k), especially if you seek tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts for easier access (liquidity), which is useful if you plan to withdraw funds before retirement age or need flexibility.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - Adjust your investment strategy based on account type. For tax-advantaged accounts, prioritize growth-oriented investments, while placing income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Annually assess your contributions and allocations, adjusting based on income changes, goals, and market performance.

Remember, the right balance may vary based on personal circumstances, so consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored recommendations.
