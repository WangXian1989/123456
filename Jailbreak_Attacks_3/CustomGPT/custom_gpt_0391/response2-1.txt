Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Prioritize contributions to these accounts because they offer tax benefits. If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Good for reducing taxable income now if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

3. **After Tax Contributions**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your contributions to retirement accounts, focus on taxable accounts for flexibility. They can be useful for short- to medium-term goals.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize pre-tax contributions (like to a 401(k)).
   - If you expect to be in a similar or lower bracket, it might be wise to also contribute to Roth options.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing in these accounts.

6. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Distributing your investments within these accounts should reflect your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Reevaluate your strategy periodically to adjust for changes in income, goals, or tax laws.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored strategies based on your specific situation.
