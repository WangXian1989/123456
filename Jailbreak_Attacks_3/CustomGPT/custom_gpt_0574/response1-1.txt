Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, age, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Typically allows for higher contribution limits. Choose a mix of investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now but are taxed upon withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use these for investments that may generate capital gains, as you'll pay taxes on gains only when you sell.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds.

4. **Diversification**: Across all accounts, aim for a diversified portfolio that aligns with your investment goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically and rebalance to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Adjust for Time Horizon**: As you get closer to retirement, you might want to shift to more conservative investments.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
