I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems that you might want to discuss with a healthcare professional. Treatment depends on the specific liver condition, but here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can be crucial for liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (like antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Regular liver function tests can help monitor the progression of liver issues.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplantation might be necessary.

5. **Nutritional Support**: Consult a nutritionist for a diet plan that supports liver health.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
