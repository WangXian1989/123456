Distributing your money between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money. Consider contributing more if you can, as contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, but income limits apply.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Trade-off**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA lower your current taxable income, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains and dividends to minimize tax burdens.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Aim to hold a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to balance risk and return. 

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a separate savings account before adding more investments, generally 3 to 6 months of living expenses.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Evaluate your asset allocation periodically and adjust contributions as your situation or market conditions change.

It’s often helpful to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances.
