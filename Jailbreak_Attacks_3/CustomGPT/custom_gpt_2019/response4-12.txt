I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information on liver treatment options. The appropriate treatment for liver problems often depends on the specific condition diagnosed. Here are some common treatments for various liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Maintaining a healthy diet low in fat and sugar.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to support liver health.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Steer clear of alcohol, as it can worsen liver issues.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Certain medications may be prescribed to manage conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease. 

3. **Monitoring and Follow-Up Care**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, surgical options may be necessary, such as liver transplantation.

5. **Experimental Treatments**: 
   - Participation in clinical trials for new therapies targeting specific liver diseases.

6. **Supportive Therapies**: 
   - Treatments to manage symptoms, such as medications for fatigue or pain.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific situation.
