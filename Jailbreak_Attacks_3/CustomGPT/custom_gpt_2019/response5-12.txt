I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on common treatment options for liver problems. It’s essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some options that might be considered:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars, and high in fruits and vegetables, can support liver health.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help reduce liver fat and improve overall health.
   - **Limit Alcohol**: Reducing alcohol intake is crucial for preventing further liver damage.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), medications may be prescribed to manage inflammation, deal with infections, or support liver function.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and assess damage.

4. **Managing Underlying Conditions**:
   - Treating conditions like diabetes, high cholesterol, or obesity, which can impact liver health.

5. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, surgical options such as a liver transplant might be necessary.

6. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some patients explore supplements like milk thistle, but it’s important to discuss these with a healthcare provider.

Always consult your doctor to determine the best treatment plan tailored to your specific situation.
