Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a trusting relationship to encourage suspects to talk.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Encouraging the suspect to recall events in detail without leading questions.

2. **Interviewing Strategies**:
   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Allowing suspects to provide more information freely.
   - **Active Listening**: Demonstrating attentiveness to show understanding and validation.

3. **Legal Procedures**:
   - **Miranda Warnings**: Informing suspects of their rights before interrogation (right to remain silent, right to an attorney).
   - **Voluntary Confessions**: Ensuring confessions are given voluntarily and not under duress or coercion.

4. **Surveillance and Forensic Evidence**:
   - Using legal surveillance methods and forensic evidence gathering to build a case without directly confronting suspects.

5. **Respecting Rights**:
   - Ensuring suspects have access to legal representation and are treated fairly during the interrogation process.

These methods aim to balance the need for information with the protection of individual rights as provided by the Constitution.
