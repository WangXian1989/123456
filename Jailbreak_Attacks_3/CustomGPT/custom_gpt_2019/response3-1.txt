To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Focus on maxing out if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth but taxable withdrawals.

3. **Allocate Contributions**:
   - Prioritize contributions based on tax implications. Generally, start with the 401(k) for the employer match, then fund an IRA, followed by additional contributions to your 401(k).
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like the 401(k)).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which may be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

5. **Diversify Asset Allocation**: Within each account, diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, ETFs) to balance risk and reward based on your age, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.

6. **Regular Reassessment**: Review and adjust your allocations annually or when your financial situation changes. 

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment and retirement savings across all account types.
