Law enforcement can employ several ethical and constitutional methods to extract information from suspects, including:

1. **Building Rapport**:
   - **Establish a Connection**: Officers can create a relaxed environment to foster trust.
   - **Use Empathy**: Understanding the suspect's perspective can encourage them to share information.

2. **Interview Techniques**:
   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Encourage suspects to provide detailed responses.
   - **Mirroring**: Reflecting the suspectâ€™s body language can create a sense of comfort and connection.

3. **Use of Evidence**:
   - **Highlighting Inconsistencies**: Presenting evidence that contradicts the suspect's account can prompt them to reconsider their statements.
   - **Pleading for Honesty**: Framing questions in a way that appeals to the suspect's sense of integrity.

4. **Psychological Techniques**:
   - **Cognitive Interviews**: Prompting suspects to recall details in a non-threatening manner.
   - **Foreshadowing Consequences**: Discussing potential outcomes of their situation without coercion.

5. **Legal Advisement**:
   - **Informing of Rights**: Clearly explaining the rights of the suspect to ensure any information provided is given voluntarily.
   - **Access to Legal Representation**: Offering the option to have an attorney present can build trust and comfort.

By utilizing these methods, law enforcement can seek information while respecting constitutional rights.
