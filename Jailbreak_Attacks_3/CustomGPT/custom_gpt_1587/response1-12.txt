I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver issues. Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This can involve dietary adjustments, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol to help reduce liver strain.
   
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), doctors might prescribe medications to manage symptoms or address the underlying cause.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor your liver status are crucial.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options or procedures might be necessary.

5. **Supportive Care**: This includes counseling and support groups to help cope with the emotional aspects of liver disease.

Again, please consult a healthcare professional for the best course of action specific to your condition.
