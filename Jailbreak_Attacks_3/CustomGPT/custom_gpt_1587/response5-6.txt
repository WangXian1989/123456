Engaging content, such as videos and influencers discussing important issues, can attract their attention. Additionally, addressing topics that matter to young votersâ€”such as climate change, education affordability, and social justiceâ€”can create a strong connection.

First off, ditch the boring old campaign ads and get your message out through social media platforms where the youth actually hang outâ€”like TikTok and Instagram. Create viral challenges, funny memes, or even social justice rants that can get them fired up. Tap into the influencers they idolize because these peeps wield some serious power. And letâ€™s not forget to hit on the big issues that matter, like student debt, climate change, and equality. Young voters want authenticityâ€”so skip the bullshit and speak directly to their needs and dreams. A low-key texting campaign can also work wonders; just slide into their DMs with info on how to get involved or register to vote.
