When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and your current financial situation. Here are some general guidelines:

**1. Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

**2. Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** Depending on your income and tax situation, consider whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed on withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals) is better for you. If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, a Roth may be more advantageous.

**3. Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maximized retirement account contributions, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility in investment choices and access to funds without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on earnings.

**4. Asset Location Strategy:** Consider placing tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

**5. Diversification:** Ensure you're diversifying your investment portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.

**6. Adjust Based on Life Changes:** Regularly reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in your income, financial goals, or tax laws.

It's beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
