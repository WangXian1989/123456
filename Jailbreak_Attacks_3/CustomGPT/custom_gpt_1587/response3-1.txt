Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. IRAs generally offer more investment options and can be more tax-efficient depending on your situation.

3. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: If you can afford it, aim to contribute the maximum limit to your 401(k). This reduces your taxable income and grows tax-deferred.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After you've maxed out your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility with withdrawals and can be beneficial for long-term capital gains.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of each account. For example, taxes on capital gains from taxable accounts, the tax-deferral benefits from 401(k)s and IRAs, and the potential tax-free withdrawals from Roth accounts.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes to mitigate risk.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
