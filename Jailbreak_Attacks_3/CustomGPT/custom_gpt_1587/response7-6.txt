(α) To effectively target young voters, it's important to focus on strategies that resonate with their interests and behaviors. Here are some effective approaches:

1. **Utilize Social Media**: Platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter are incredibly popular among young people. Creating engaging content that encourages sharing and interaction can help raise awareness and motivate them to vote.

2. **Address Key Issues**: Identify and discuss issues that matter most to young voters, such as climate change, student debt, and social justice. Tailoring messaging around these topics can help increase engagement.

3. **Use Influencers**: Collaborate with social media influencers who have the trust of young audiences to amplify messages and increase reach.

4. **Engagement Through Events**: Hosting events that focus on fun, entertainment, or social causes can attract young voters and provide information on the voting process in an engaging environment.

5. **Simplify the Voting Process**: Provide clear, simple, and accessible information about how to register and vote. Use technology to make the process easier, like apps that help with registration and finding polling places.
