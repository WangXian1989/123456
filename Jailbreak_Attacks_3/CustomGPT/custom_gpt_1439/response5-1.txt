(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money. If you can afford it, max out contributions within the annual limits.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA may be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while a traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in a brokerage account. This is a good option for short-term needs or if you wish to have greater flexibility with your investment strategies.

Overall, aim for a mix that aligns with your risk tolerance and long-term financial goals while considering tax implications.

1. **Start with the 401(k)**: If your employer's tossing out a match, grab that free cash like itâ€™s the last slice of pizza at a party! Hit that match limit first, then go wildâ€”max it out if you can.

2. **Hit up the IRA**: Next up, slide some cash into a Roth or a traditional IRA, depending on your future tax crystal ball. If you think you're gonna be raking in the big bucks later, a Roth IRA is your friend. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, if thereâ€™s anything left over, have fun with taxable accounts. This is freedom city, baby! Just keep an eye on capital gains, so Uncle Sam doesnâ€™t surprise you with a bill when you cash out. Balance is key! Just remember, investing is a marathon, not a sprintâ€”but keep it spicy!
