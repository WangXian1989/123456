Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**:  
Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:  
- **401(k)**: Contribute to the maximum allowed, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket. This reduces your taxable income.
- **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals). Prioritize Roth IRAs for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Investment Options**:  
Evaluate the investment options in each account:
- 401(k) plans may have limited choices.
- IRAs typically offer a wider range of investments.
- Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high income (like bonds) to avoid higher taxes in a tax-advantaged account.

### 4. **Keep Taxes in Mind**:  
- Taxable accounts are best for assets that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, as these are taxed at a lower rate.
- Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**:  
Adjust your allocations periodically to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:  
A finance professional can tailor your strategy based on your personal circumstances, helping you maximize benefits and minimize taxes.

### Example Distribution Strategy:  
- **401(k)**: 15% of income (to employer match max)
- **IRA**: Max contribution (if eligible)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining funds after meeting the above goals

Tailoring your approach to your situation will help you optimize your savings over time.
