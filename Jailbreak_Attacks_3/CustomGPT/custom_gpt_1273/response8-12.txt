1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Improving your diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol are crucial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver issue, medications might include antivirals for hepatitis or medications to manage symptoms.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and assess any changes.

4. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating conditions such as diabetes or high cholesterol can benefit liver health.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant might be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare provider for a personalized plan.
