The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), offering tax benefits depending on your situation.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Stay within the annual contribution limits for IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow you to access funds without penalties. Consider using them for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- **Short-Term Needs**: Keep funds in taxable accounts for easy access.
- **Mid-Term Goals**: Consider a mix of taxable accounts and IRAs.
- **Long-Term Retirement**: Prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions first.

### Rebalancing:
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changing financial goals, and market conditions.

### Consult a Professional:
- Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances and optimize your portfolio.

This diversified approach helps manage risk while maximizing growth potential over time.
