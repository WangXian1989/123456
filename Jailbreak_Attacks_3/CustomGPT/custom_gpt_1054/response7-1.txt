The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and overall financial strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to get that full match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax benefits, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. anticipated future tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxed annually (capital gains, dividends). Use these accounts for investments that may yield higher returns, knowing they’ll be taxed more frequently.

### 2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Short-term savings may be best suited for taxable accounts, while long-term retirement saving can be prioritized in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Consider your investment horizon; longer-term investments can often tolerate stock exposure, while shorter-term needs may warrant a conservative approach.

### 3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investment allocation aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts. Diversify your holdings to mitigate risk.

### 4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Allocate funds accordingly to maximize tax advantages while maintaining liquidity in taxable accounts for shorter-term needs.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on performance, changes in financial goals, and market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the max employer match.
- **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth; otherwise, use a Traditional IRA.
- **Taxable**: Allocate funds here as needed, especially for short-term goals or after maxing out your retirement accounts.

Engaging a financial advisor may also be beneficial to create a personalized plan tailored to your specific circumstances.
