Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: Max out your 401(k) contributions next, especially if you can benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out your retirement accounts, then consider investing in taxable accounts. They provide more flexibility for withdrawals but may be subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, maintain a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, higher-risk investments (like stocks) can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while lower-risk investments (like bonds) can be in taxable accounts due to different tax treatments.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

7. **Consider Professional Advice**: It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your unique financial situation.

Always be mindful of contribution limits, tax implications, and your personal circumstances when making decisions.
