Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to both Traditional and Roth IRAs, leveraging tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on strategies to minimize taxes, like holding investments long-term for capital gains rates and using tax-loss harvesting.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Allocate a mix of stock and bond funds across all accounts, but prioritize higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals to maintain your desired asset mix.

### 5. **Plan for Withdrawals:**
   - Consider your future withdrawal strategy, as tax implications can differ significantly between account types during retirement.

### Summary:
- **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first** to maximize growth potential.
- **Diversify and regularly rebalance** across all accounts.
- **Evaluate your tax strategy** based on your current and expected future tax brackets. 

By combining these strategies, you can create a robust plan for your investments.
