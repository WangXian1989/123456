Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - Max out your contributions if you can, as these accounts offer tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - A traditional IRA can also be a good option if you anticipate a lower tax rate in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you max out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.
   - Taxable accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be used for shorter-term goals.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and growth potential.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Keep tax implications in mind: taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, while retirement accounts can defer or exempt taxes.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment allocation and adjust based on market conditions and life changes.

Consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy based on your unique circumstances.
