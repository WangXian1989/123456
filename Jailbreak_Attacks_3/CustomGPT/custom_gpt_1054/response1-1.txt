Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly impact your long-term investment strategy and tax efficiency. Here are some considerations to help you make the best decision:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: Often has higher contribution limits and potential employer matching. Withdrawals are taxed as income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional) or tax-free during retirement (Roth). Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds can be accessed anytime but are subject to capital gains tax on profits.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially "free money."

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Suitable for investments expected to grow significantly, as you'll defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Tax-Free Growth (Roth IRA)**: Best for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Good for flexibility in withdrawals and investments you expect to hold for less than a year.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Ensure your portfolio across all accounts is diversified to manage risk. Tailor your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations. Market conditions and life changes may necessitate adjustments.

### Sample Strategy:
1. **Max 401(k) to get the employer match.**
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (prioritize Roth if eligible).
3. **Invest any additional savings in a taxable account** for short-term flexibility or specific goals.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Long-Term Goals**: Think about your retirement age and lifestyle.
- **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how and when you will withdraw funds, considering tax implications.
