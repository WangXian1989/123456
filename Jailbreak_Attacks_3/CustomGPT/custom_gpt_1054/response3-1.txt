Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contribution if possible (e.g., the annual limit, which is $22,500 for 2024).
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA. For 2024, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions.

### 2. **Assess Your Taxable Account Needs:**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to your taxable account for flexibility. This can be useful for short- to medium-term goals, as you can access these funds without penalties.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Options:**
   - **401(k):** Often has limited investment options, typically mutual funds with higher fees.
   - **IRA:** Offers a wider array of investments, including individual stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds, which may have lower fees.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for investments that generate lower capital gains, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts, adjusting based on your retirement target date, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice taking your specific circumstances into account, consider working with a financial advisor.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15%-20% of your income (prioritize up to the employer match).
- **IRA:** Up to the contribution limit.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings beyond the above contributions.

This strategy balances growth potential with tax efficiency, helping you work towards your retirement goals effectively.
