Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your contributions if you're eligible, especially if it's a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as income in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed annually. This account is best for short-term goals or flexible funds.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth. Invest in a diversified mix of stocks and bonds appropriate for your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for more liquid investments, considering tax-efficient funds (like ETFs) to minimize yearly tax impact.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

### 5. **Debt and Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund and consider paying off high-interest debt before investing heavily.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailor your strategy to your unique financial situation.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 30%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 40%

Adjust based on your specific financial goals, age, and risk tolerance.
