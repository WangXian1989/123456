1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and high in fruits and vegetables.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis B or C).
   - **Immunosuppressants**: For autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging studies (like ultrasound) to assess liver health.

4. **Minimally Invasive Procedures**:
   - **Endoscopy**: To treat varices caused by portal hypertension.

5. **Surgery**:
   - Liver transplant for severe liver failure or cirrhosis.

6. **Alternative Therapies**:

Always consult with a healthcare professional for tailored advice based on your specific condition.
