To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Utilize a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax strategy. Roth IRAs are great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) are best for higher-income investments since you defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - Taxable accounts can be good for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends, minimizing your tax burden.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider holding assets that generate higher returns in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to benefit from compounding without immediate tax impacts.
   - Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain an adequate emergency fund outside of your retirement accounts to avoid penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement, balancing between tax exposure and account types to minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help tailor your strategy based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Balancing contributions across these accounts can enhance your investment growth while optimizing your tax situation.
