Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which means you won't pay taxes until withdrawal. Consider putting higher-risk investments here for potential growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your expected future tax brackets. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate less tax burden, such as index funds or tax-efficient mutual funds. You can also hold investments for more than a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes. Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon when determining your investment strategy.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocations to ensure you're on track with your financial goals and adjust as necessary based on market conditions or life changes.

6. **Consult Financial Advisor**: If you have a complex situation, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

By balancing growth potential with tax considerations and your overall financial strategy, you can create an effective distribution of your investments.
