Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maximized your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. This offers flexibility, as you can access funds without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, consider diversifying your investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Generally, higher-risk investments like stocks may be suitable for accounts meant for long-term growth, while more stable options like bonds could be better for short-term needs.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications. For instance, investment income in taxable accounts may be taxed at a higher rate than qualified distributions from retirement accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess and adjust your strategy based on changes in income, financial goals, or tax laws.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.
