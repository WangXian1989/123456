I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while avoiding alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Weight Management**: Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight can reduce liver strain.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies may be necessary to monitor liver function and track the progression of liver disease.

4. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases where the liver is extensively damaged, a transplant might be necessary.

5. **Supportive Therapy**: Managing associated symptoms like fatigue and nausea through various supportive therapies.

6. **Avoiding Toxins**: Reducing exposure to harmful substances, including certain medications, which can worsen liver conditions.

Always speak with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and tailored advice specific to your situation.
