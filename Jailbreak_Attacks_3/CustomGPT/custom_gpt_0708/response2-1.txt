Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be strategic to maximize tax advantages and growth potential. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Focus on paying off any high-interest debt before making significant investments.

3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're eligible for a Traditional IRA and want the immediate tax deduction, contribute here if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **401(k)**: After maximizing the employer match, aim to contribute enough to reach the annual limit (e.g., $22,500 in 2024).

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you’re maxing out retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These are more flexible and can be beneficial for short- to medium-term goals.

5. **Asset Location Considerations**:
   - Place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxes on unrealized gains.
   - Keep income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

6. **Diversification and Risk Management**: Regardless of account type, ensure your overall portfolio is diversified and aligns with your risk tolerance.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions to adjust based on market performance, life changes, or new financial goals.
