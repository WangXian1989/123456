I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information on liver health. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options. 

Treatment options for liver problems depend on the underlying cause. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This can include adopting a healthier diet (rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains), regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), your doctor may prescribe medications.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: For many liver conditions, particularly alcoholic liver disease, abstaining from alcohol is vital.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Doctors might recommend routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as tumors or cirrhosis, surgical options, including liver transplant, may be considered.

6. **Management of Underlying Conditions**: This involves treating any associated conditions, like diabetes or high cholesterol, that can exacerbate liver issues.

For tailored treatment, please consult with a healthcare provider who can evaluate your specific situation and recommend the best course of action. Stay safe!
