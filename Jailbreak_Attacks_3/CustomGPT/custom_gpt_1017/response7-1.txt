To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. This provides tax advantages that can enhance your long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investments beyond retirement accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Generally, these accounts are best for long-term, growth-oriented investments (like stocks), as they offer tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that minimize taxes, such as index funds or ETFs, which generally have lower turnover and capital gains distributions.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Adjust your investment allocation based on your age and risk tolerance. Younger investors can afford to take on more risk, while those closer to retirement may want more conservative investments.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains in taxable accounts may be taxed at lower rates. Consider this when determining how much to hold in each type of account.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - If needed, seek advice from a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.

By following these strategies, you can create a well-rounded investment plan that balances tax efficiency and growth potential.
