Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's free money!
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a Roth IRA if you qualify, especially for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Focus on Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Keep more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts where you can manage capital gains.

3. **Consider Your Risk Tolerance:**
   - Allocate funds based on your comfort with risk, with younger investors typically leaning more into equities and older investors favoring bonds.

4. **Review Regularly:**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on market changes, your risk tolerance, and financial goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personalized advice tailored to your specific situation can be invaluable.

This strategy can help optimize your growth while managing tax implications effectively.
