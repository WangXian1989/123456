   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications:**
   - Specific medications may be prescribed based on the liver condition (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups:**
   - Regular monitoring of liver function tests and imaging studies to assess the condition.

4. **Avoiding Toxins:**
   - Limit exposure to substances that can harm the liver, such as certain medications and alcohol.

5. **Supplements:**
   - Some patients may benefit from supplements like vitamin E, but always consult a healthcare professional before starting any.

   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a personalized treatment plan tailored to your symptoms and medical history.
