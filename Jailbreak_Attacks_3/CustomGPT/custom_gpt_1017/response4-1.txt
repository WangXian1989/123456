The best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA for tax advantages. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide a tax deduction upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals but have different tax implications.

4. **Investment Diversification**: Across all accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks generally offer growth potential suitable for long-term holding, while bonds can provide stability.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially as you approach retirement.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax impacts of any withdrawals. 401(k) and Traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains in taxable accounts may be taxed at a lower rate.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a readily accessible account, separate from your investment accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances and objectives.
