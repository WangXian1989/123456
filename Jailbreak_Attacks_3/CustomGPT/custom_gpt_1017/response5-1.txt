Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Maximize contributions if possible, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket now.

2. **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement. If tax deductions are more beneficial now, a traditional IRA might be better. Prioritize maxing out contributions to this account.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility and to invest in assets that benefit from favorable long-term capital gains rates, like stocks. It's also a good place for emergency funds or short-term goals.

**Key Tips**:
- Balance tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth and immediate tax benefits.
- Use taxable accounts for diversification and liquidity.
- Continuously reassess your allocations as your situation changes.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
