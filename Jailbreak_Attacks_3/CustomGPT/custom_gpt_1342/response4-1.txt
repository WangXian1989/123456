When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Roth IRA**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider maximizing contributions here, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Traditional IRA**: This can be beneficial if you need immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for save-for-goals funds or investments that may not be suitable for retirement accounts.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

### General Guidelines:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Tailor your investments to your risk tolerance and timeline. 
- **Diversification**: Diversify across asset classes in all accounts.
- **Tax Considerations**: Consider the tax implications of withdrawing funds from each account in retirement.

### Review Regularly:
- Regularly assess and adjust your contributions based on goals, market performance, and tax law changes. 

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
