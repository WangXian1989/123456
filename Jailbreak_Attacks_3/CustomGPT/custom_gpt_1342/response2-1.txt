Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Good for high earners.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also tax-deductible; consider if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Ideal for younger investors expecting higher income in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility and potential tax benefits on capital gains. They are also ideal for short-term goals.

5. **Diversification**: Consider diversifying investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your distribution strategy yearly to adjust for changes in financial situation or market conditions.

Always consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation!
