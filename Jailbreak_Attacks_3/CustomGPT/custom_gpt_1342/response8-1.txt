Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general steps to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit if you are looking for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify, as contributions are made after tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for assets that may incur tax consequences sooner, such as individual stocks or bonds.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across these accounts to manage risk.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a liquid emergency fund outside of these accounts for immediate needs.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust as necessary based on performance and life changes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider consulting a professional.

This strategy aims for growth while balancing tax implications. Always consider your personal financial situation and goals.
