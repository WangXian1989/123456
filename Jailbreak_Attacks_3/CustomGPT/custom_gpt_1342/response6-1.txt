To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

### 1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs work similarly to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs use after-tax contributions, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes; however, they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs to benefit from compounding growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may require quicker access to funds.

### Recommendations:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers matching contributions for a 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match.
- **Diversify Contributions**: 
  - Allocate funds to max out the IRA (if eligible), especially for Roth accounts for tax-free growth.
  - Use taxable accounts for flexibility and investments not suited for retirement accounts.

### Sample Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to reach the employer match first.
- **IRA**: Max out your IRA contributions next (for 2023, it's $6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Account**: Allocate remaining funds for investment opportunities or liquidity.

### Regular Review:
- Reassess your contributions annually based on investment performance, tax law changes, and personal financial goals. 

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
