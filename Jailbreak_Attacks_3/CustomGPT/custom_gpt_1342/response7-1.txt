Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), contributions may also have tax benefits. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Money here is subject to capital gains taxes, so it's generally advisable to keep investments with high turnover or less favorable tax treatment in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Time Horizon**: If you're saving for long-term goals (e.g., retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, you might want to use taxable accounts for more flexibility.

4. **Investment Options**: 401(k)s may have limited investment choices. If your 401(k) options are poor, consider funneling more money into IRAs or taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Taxable accounts allow you to access your funds without penalties at any age, while retirement accounts may impose penalties for early withdrawals.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance and investment strategy, regardless of the account type.

For personalized advice based on your specific situation, it's always best to consult a financial advisor.
