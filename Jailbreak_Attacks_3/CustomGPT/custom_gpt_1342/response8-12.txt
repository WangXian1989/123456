I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general self-care tips for liver health. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid processed foods, refined sugars, and excessive fats.

2. **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water to help your liver function properly.

3. **Limit Alcohol**: Reducing alcohol intake can significantly improve liver health.

4. **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and support overall liver function.

5. **Regular Check-ups**: Regular visits to a healthcare provider can help monitor liver health and address any issues early.

6. **Medication Management**: Avoid over-the-counter medications that can harm the liver, especially acetaminophen.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for diagnoses and targeted treatment options.
