To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Depending on your tax situation, prioritize maxing out contributions to an IRA after your 401(k) if eligible.

2. **Consider Current and Future Tax Implications**:
   - Use Roth accounts for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you expect your tax rate to increase.
   - Traditional accounts may be better if you anticipate a lower tax rate in retirement.

3. **Balance Between Short-Term and Long-Term Goals**:
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments that you might need sooner.
   - Allocate more towards tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.

4. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on risk tolerance.
   - Ensure a mix that aligns with your long-term financial goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial planner who can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

Make sure to factor in your age, retirement timeline, and financial goals when making these decisions.
