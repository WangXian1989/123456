I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Improving diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, drugs may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.
3. **Hepatitis Therapy**: Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.
4. **Fatty Liver Management**: Weight loss programs and diabetes management for fatty liver disease.
5. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver health.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
