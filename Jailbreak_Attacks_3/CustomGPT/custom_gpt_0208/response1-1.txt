To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits:**
   - Max out any employer match in your 401(k) first; this is free money.
   - Know the annual contribution limits for IRAs and 401(k)s.

2. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed later.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings (interest, dividends, and capital gains) are taxable in the year they are realized.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - For retirement accounts, invest with a long-term horizon (stocks, mutual funds).
   - For taxable accounts, consider a mix of growth and income-generating investments.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to minimize risks.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how you will access funds in retirement. Typically, it's tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation based on market conditions and your risk tolerance.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
