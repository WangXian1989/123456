Distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations:

### 1. **Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Match contributions from your employer if available.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth on qualified withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. Consider this account for short-term goals or when you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for long-term growth. 
   - **Short-term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds needed in the near future.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a balanced investment portfolio across all accounts, considering asset allocation suitable for your risk tolerance.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes. Often, it’s more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. **Maximize 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
2. **Contribute to IRA**: Max out contributions to a tax-advantaged account.
3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use any remaining funds for high-growth investments, keeping in mind tax implications.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Reassess your strategy annually to adjust for changes in income, financial goals, or retirement plans.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor your approach to your unique situation.
