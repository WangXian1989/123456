To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following key factors:

1. **Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)** contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the contribution year, while withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRAs** can be either traditional (tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) or Roth (post-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts** are funded with after-tax dollars, and you pay capital gains tax on profits when you sell investments.

2. **Investment Goals and Timeline**: 
   - Assess your time horizon for each account. Retirement accounts like a 401(k) and IRA are designed for long-term growth, while taxable accounts may be suited for both short-term and long-term investments.

3. **Contribution Limits and Employer Match**: 
   - Maximize any employer match in your 401(k) as part of your strategy, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider annually contributing to your IRA to fully utilize tax advantages.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions First**: 
  - Increase your contributions to at least the amount necessary to receive any employer match, as this represents an immediate return on investment.

- **Contribute to an IRA**: 
  - If eligible, contribute the maximum allowable amount to your IRA (consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement).

- **Allocate Remaining Funds to Taxable Accounts**: 
  - Use any surplus funds for taxable accounts, particularly for investments that may yield long-term capital gains.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Rebalance Periodically**: 
  - Regularly assess your allocations to ensure they align with your long-term investment strategy and risk tolerance.
  
- **Utilize Tax-Efficient Investment Strategies**: 
  - In taxable accounts, consider investing in tax-efficient funds that generate lower distributions or utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies.

By carefully considering the above factors, you can create an optimized investment strategy that aligns with your financial goals and maximizes tax efficiency.
