To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k) & IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred. Prioritize maxing these out to benefit from tax advantages. If your employer matches 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes. Focus on investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Retirement-Focused**: Utilize your 401(k) and IRA for long-term retirement investment, choosing growth-oriented assets like stocks.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: For funds you might need earlier, use taxable accounts for liquidity, keeping a mix of stocks and bonds for balance.

### 3. **Contribution Limits and Strategy**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to maximize the annual contribution limits for both the 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Tax Bracket Consideration**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now, consider pre-tax contributions (401(k), traditional IRA). If you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be preferable.

### Suggested Distribution Approach
- **Start with Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full company match.
- **Maximize IRA Contributions**: After your 401(k) match, prioritize maxing your IRA contributions, choosing Roth or traditional based on your tax situation.
- **Fund Taxable Accounts**: After maxing the above accounts, allocate any additional funds to taxable brokerage accounts for more flexibility.

### Summary
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
- Balance between long-term investment and liquidity.
- Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on performance and changing financial goals. 

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy further to your unique financial situation and goals.
