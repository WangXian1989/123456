Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Maximize your employer match. If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it as it’s essentially “free money.”
   - Consider contributing up to the maximum limit if you can afford it, as this account provides tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer immediate tax benefits, a Traditional IRA could be beneficial.
   - Aim to max out your contributions after your 401(k) match, as IRAs often have lower contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement or for short-term goals.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax impact.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts that reflects your overall risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Adjust asset allocation according to the tax treatment of each account. For instance, holding high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts can be beneficial.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocation as needed to keep your investment strategy aligned with your goals and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
