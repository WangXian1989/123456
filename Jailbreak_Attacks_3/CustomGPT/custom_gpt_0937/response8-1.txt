To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approaches:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) if it offers a solid employer match. If not, balance it with your IRA.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it as it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions in the year of contribution.

3. **Asset Allocation Strategies**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and Traditional IRA): Invest in assets that generate higher returns, such as stocks, since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Tax-Exempt Accounts** (Roth IRA): Place your highest growth investments here to maximize tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, such as index funds or tax-efficient funds, as capital gains are taxed even if they’re not withdrawn.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, you may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred, and lastly tax-free accounts.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changing financial goals, market conditions, or tax laws.

6. **Consider Fees and Expenses**: Look for low-cost investment options in all accounts to maximize returns over time.

It's also advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
