Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach that considers your financial goals, tax implications, and liquidity needs. Here are some guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax-deferred growth, which can significantly enhance your retirement savings.
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), ensure you contribute at least enough to obtain the full match as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties and are essential for short- to medium-term goals, like buying a home or funding a child’s education.
   - **Different Investments**: Consider investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) or tax-managed funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, long-term growth investments may fit well in your tax-deferred accounts, while more conservative or income-generating investments could be suitable for taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you approach retirement, develop a strategy for which accounts to draw from first. Generally, it may be more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts before tapping into retirement accounts, allowing your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Consider Professional Advice**:
   - If you're uncertain about your investment strategy or tax implications, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.

Ultimately, the right distribution will depend on your specific financial situation and goals. Regularly reviewing and adjusting your strategy as your circumstances change is also essential.
