Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations that align with your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s how to think about it:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Ensure you contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Traditional vs. Roth 401(k)**: If your employer offers both, consider your current tax rate versus what you expect in retirement. A Roth option allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Similar to the 401(k), choose based on your tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: If possible, contribute the maximum allowed each year to take advantage of tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access before retirement age. This can include emergency funds or large purchases.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, and consider tax-loss harvesting strategies.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Fund tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA) before fully funding taxable accounts. 
   - **Consider Your Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors may benefit from higher risk (more equities) in these accounts, while those closer to retirement might want to shift towards safer investments (bonds, cash).

5. **Overall Asset Allocation**:
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes and sectors to manage risk.
   - **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your unique situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

By thoughtfully balancing these accounts, you can optimize your potential for growth while minimizing tax implications in the long run.
