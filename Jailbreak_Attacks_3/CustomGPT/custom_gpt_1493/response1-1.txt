When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA, as these can lower your taxable income.
   - Max out annual contributions to these accounts if possible.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth, focusing on a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - Taxable accounts can hold more liquid investments or those with lower expected returns (like bonds or dividend stocks) since capital gains tax may apply.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for when you'll need access to your funds. Typically, you can withdraw from a taxable account without penalties at any time, unlike retirement accounts which may incur penalties for early withdrawal.
   - Consider the implications of withdrawing from these accounts based on your current tax bracket.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to minimize risk.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal situations vary greatly. A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific goals, income levels, and tax situations.

In summary, maximize your tax-advantaged contributions first, then balance further investments based on your needs and goals.
