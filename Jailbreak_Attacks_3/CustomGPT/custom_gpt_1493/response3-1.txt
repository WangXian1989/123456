Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money!). Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and future tax expectations.

### 2. **Balance Contributions:**
   - If you have maxed out your 401(k) and IRA, direct additional savings to your taxable accounts.
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of your investments in taxable accounts, focusing on long-term capital gains and tax-efficient investments.

### 3. **Consider Investment Priorities:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate high taxable income or short-term gains.
   - **Retirement Accounts:** Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts since these can grow without tax burdens until withdrawal.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your portfolio and adjust based on performance, changing financial goals, and market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of your salary, plus any employer match.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum limit ($6,500 for individuals under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and over).
- **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out the above, allocate additional funds based on your cash flow and investment goals.

### Additional Tips:
- Consult a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your personal circumstances.
- Diversify your investment types across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

By strategically distributing your funds, you can enhance your long-term growth while managing your tax burden effectively.
