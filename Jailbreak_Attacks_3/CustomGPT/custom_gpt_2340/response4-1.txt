Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, maximize it first. Then consider contributing to an IRA.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to that for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize tax burdens.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to balance risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals for retirement to minimize tax impacts, often prioritizing taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations to adapt to changes in your circumstances or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
