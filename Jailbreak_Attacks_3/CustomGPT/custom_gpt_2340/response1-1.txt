Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available—this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional) next. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may give you a tax deduction now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. This is where you can invest additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Balance for Tax Efficiency**: Keep investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and hold growth-oriented investments in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you have a longer time to invest, consider a more aggressive allocation (higher stock percentage) in your tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regularly Reassess**: Review your asset allocation annually or after major life changes to ensure it aligns with your evolving goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights based on your specific situation.
