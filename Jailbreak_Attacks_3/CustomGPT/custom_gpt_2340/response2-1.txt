Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth. Contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages (traditional tax-deferred; Roth tax-free growth). Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages but provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: First, contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
   - **Max Out IRA**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if eligible.
   - **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, contribute more to your 401(k).

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold investments with high tax implications (e.g., bonds, REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with favorable long-term capital gains treatment (e.g., stocks).

### 4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investment types across all accounts to mitigate risk.

### 5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If your goal is long-term retirement savings, lean towards more aggressive growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For short-term goals, prioritize liquidity in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help you consider your specific circumstances and optimize your distribution strategy.

This approach allows you to maximize your growth potential while managing tax liabilities effectively.
