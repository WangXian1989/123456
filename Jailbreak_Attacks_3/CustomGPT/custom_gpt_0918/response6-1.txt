Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a strategic approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially “free money.” 
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Current Tax Bracket**
   - **High Income**: Favor contributions to tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) to lower taxable income.
   - **Low Income**: Consider Roth contributions, allowing tax-free growth.

### 3. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - In taxable accounts, consider investments that generate qualified dividends or capital gains, which typically have lower tax rates.
   - Hold less tax-efficient investments (e.g., bonds, real estate) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Establish an Emergency Fund** 
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have 3-6 months' worth of living expenses readily available in a high-yield savings account.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly review and adjust the asset allocation across accounts to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

### Conclusion
Adapting your strategy based on changes in income, financial goals, or tax laws is crucial. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights tailored to your situation.
