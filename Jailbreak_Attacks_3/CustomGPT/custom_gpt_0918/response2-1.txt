When deciding how to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. Take advantage of employer matches if available.
   - **IRA**: Similar benefits for Traditional IRAs. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, so weigh future tax rates in your decision.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income is taxed annually, but you can take advantage of capital gains rates, which may be lower. 

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Short-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts, while long-term goals can benefit from the tax advantages of a 401(k) or IRA.
   
3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. Maximize employer match in your 401(k) first, then contribute to an IRA, and finally use taxable accounts for additional investments.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Use a mix of account types to diversify your investment strategy. For instance, hold riskier assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for how and when you will withdraw funds in retirement. Having a balance of account types can provide flexibility and tax management options.

6. **Fees and Expenses**:
   - Consider the fees associated with each account type. Sometimes 401(k) plans have higher fees compared to IRAs or taxable accounts.

7. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Align your investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon within each account based on tax implications and your broader financial strategy.

Start by assessing your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax situation, and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
