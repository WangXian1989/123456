Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). A traditional 401(k) reduces taxable income now, while a Roth 401(k) allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Investment Options**: Often limited to the plans provided by your employer.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 for 2024).
   - **Tax Advantages**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions (depending on income and retirement plan coverage), while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Generally more investment options compared to a 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: No contribution limits or withdrawal penalties. Useful for mid-term goals (buying a home, travel).
   - **Tax Implications**: Capital gains and dividend taxes apply; however, long-term capital gains are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Investment Choices**: Broad range of investments.

### Suggested Strategy
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start by maximizing your 401(k) contributions to get the employer match. Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if feasible.
- **Distribute Remaining Funds**: Any additional funds can go into your taxable account for flexibility and access.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Maintain an asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income (to the match cap)
- **IRA**: Contribute the max allowable amount after hitting the match
- **Taxable**: Direct remaining funds as needed for liquidity or investment diversification.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific situation.
