Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After securing the match, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit if you're in a higher tax bracket. Contributions lower your taxable income now.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. A Traditional IRA can provide tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice may depend on your current and expected future tax brackets.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), direct additional savings to taxable accounts. These accounts provide liquidity and flexibility. Focus on tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Diversify your investments among asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and rebalance periodically to maintain your desired risk level. 

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals and capital gains. Withdrawals from 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free after age 59Â½ if held for at least five years.

7. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your allocations with your long-term financial goals, such as retirement age or major expenses (like buying a home).

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your individual circumstances. 

By balancing contributions across these accounts strategically, you can optimize your savings while addressing tax and liquidity needs.
