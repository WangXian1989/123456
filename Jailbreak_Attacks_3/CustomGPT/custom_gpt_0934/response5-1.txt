Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. Then, consider maximizing contributions to an IRA, which can give you tax-deferred growth and potential tax deductions.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts don’t provide the same tax advantages as retirement accounts. Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds or funds with high turnover) in your tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Your asset allocation (the mix of stocks, bonds, etc.) is crucial. Generally, more volatile investments (like stocks) might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to allow for long-term growth without immediate tax implications. More stable investments (like bonds) can be held in taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Ideally, you’ll want to withdraw from the account that has the least tax impact first. This might be taxable accounts initially, depending on your tax bracket.

5. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations regularly, especially as your financial situation and market conditions change.

It's also wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.
