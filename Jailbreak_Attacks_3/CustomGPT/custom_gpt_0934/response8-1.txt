Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, if you qualify.

2. **Prioritize Accounts Based on Tax Treatment**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should be used for assets that may generate high taxes, such as bonds or actively managed funds, as capital gains taxes are typically lower than income tax rates.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & Traditional IRA)**: Good for high-income-generating investments, since you won't pay taxes until you withdraw money in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have a robust emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a high-yield savings account.

4. **Diversify Across Accounts**:
   - Keep a mix of stocks and bonds that aligns with your risk tolerance in each account, but be mindful of your overall allocation.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy Planning**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement—having a strategy for which accounts to tap first can mitigate tax impacts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your investment across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice based on your specific circumstances can be invaluable.

By balancing your investments across these accounts, you can optimize your return on investment while minimizing taxes.
