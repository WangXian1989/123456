Investing strategies can vary significantly based on individual goals, risk tolerance, and tax situations, but here are some general guidelines for distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if eligible (traditional or Roth, based on your tax situation).

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growthâ€”good for long-term investments. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if qualified.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Here, you'll pay capital gains tax on profits. Use these for short-term goals or emergencies.

3. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Keep tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA).
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a readily accessible account to avoid early withdrawals from retirement accounts, which may incur penalties.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk. This includes stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired level of risk across all accounts.
