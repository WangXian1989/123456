Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your age, tax bracket, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Utilize IRAs**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions here if you seek tax deductions. It’s beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later, contributing to a Roth IRA can be advantageous, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. These accounts can be used for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to minimize the impact of taxes. Keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distributions based on changes in income, financial goals, or tax laws.

Working with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
