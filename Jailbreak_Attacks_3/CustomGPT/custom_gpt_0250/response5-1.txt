Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions, particularly if it’s a Roth IRA, which provides tax-free growth.

3. **Fill Up the 401(k)**: If you can, maximize contributions to your 401(k) after funding your IRA. This can provide significant tax benefits.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across these accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on market changes and your own financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice to suit your needs.
