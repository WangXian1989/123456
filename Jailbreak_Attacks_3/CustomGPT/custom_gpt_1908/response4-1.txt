To provide tailored advice, it would be helpful to know your financial goals, risk tolerance, age, and other specifics. However, here's a general approach to distributing funds amongst these accounts:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA if you're eligible. Both account types offer tax advantages; a Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, whereas Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This will give you flexibility regarding withdrawals and investment choices, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

You might consider a diversified investment strategy across all account types that aligns with your risk tolerance. Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a plan specific to your needs.
