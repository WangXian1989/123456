Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of several factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and time horizon. Here's a strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your workplace offers a 401(k) plan with matching contributions, make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially 'free money' and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, for instance, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 for those aged 50 and older), while IRAs have a limit of $6,500 ($7,500 for those aged 50 and older).

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Generally, you should prioritize funding tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA) first before contributing to taxable accounts. This is because these accounts can offer tax deferral or tax-free growth.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risks. 

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income in retirement, while withdrawals from Roth IRAs and taxable accounts may have different tax implications. As you plan your distributions in retirement, consider how taxes will impact your net income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, your investment allocation may drift from your original plan due to market fluctuations. Regularly review and rebalance your accounts to maintain your target asset allocation.

7. **Plan for Withdrawals**: When you retire, consider the order in which you plan to withdraw from your accounts. It may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, allowing tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique financial situation and retirement goals.
