Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), make sure you're contributing enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Contributions to 401(k)s and IRAs can reduce your taxable income now or in retirement. Consider maxing these accounts out before contributing to taxable accounts.

3. **Consider the Type of IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your choice may depend on whether you expect to be in a higher tax bracket now or later.

4. **Balancing Act of Risk:** Consider your risk tolerance. Typically, you may want to hold riskier investments in accounts where you can defer taxes (like 401(k)s and IRAs) and safer investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxable income.

5. **Withdrawals and Tax Implications:** Remember that withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, whereas capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate. It might be wise to maintain an appropriate balance in accounts to optimize your tax situation in retirement.

6. **Emergency Savings:** Ensure you have adequate emergency savings outside of your retirement accounts. This prevents you from having to dip into retirement funds prematurely.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A financial advisor can help tailor a distribution strategy that aligns with your specific financial circumstances and goals.

Ultimately, the ideal distribution will vary based on individual circumstances, so consider these factors and adjust as needed.
