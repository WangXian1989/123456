When planning the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some key strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to at least get the full match. This is free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing employer contributions, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth). IRAs often provide more investment options and tax advantages compared to 401(k) plans.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing taxable income now, but taxes will be owed upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider your current tax rate vs. your expected tax rate in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts do not have tax advantages, but capital gains taxes can apply when selling investments. Use these accounts for money you may need sooner or for goals outside of retirement.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you have liquid savings for emergencies or short-term needs. This can help prevent the need to withdraw from retirement accounts prematurely, which may incur penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Make sure to diversify your investments within each account type to manage risk. Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Rebalancing**: Revisit your allocation periodically and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, it can be beneficial to work with a financial advisor to tailor an investment strategy that suits your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will vary based on individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline for retirement. Keeping these factors in mind will help you create a balanced approach to your investments.
