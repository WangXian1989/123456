Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional:** If you qualify, consider whether a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA aligns better with your tax strategy. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax deductions.

3. **Tax-Efficiency:** Generally, it's considered more tax-efficient to hold less tax-friendly investments (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) or IRA) and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or securities that appreciate in value) in taxable accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals:** Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account or liquid assets separate from your investment accounts. Prioritize funding your emergency fund before maximizing investments.

5. **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts. This includes spreading out investments across asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and alternative investments based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Review and Adjust:** Review your allocations periodically to align with changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.

It may also be helpful to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation. They can help navigate tax implications and investment strategies that fit your financial goals.
