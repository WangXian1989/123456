Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves a few considerations:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions may be pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Focus on maximizing employer matches first.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; otherwise, a Traditional IRA offers immediate tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

2. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before contributing, ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (3-6 months' expenses).

3. **Debt Management**:
   - Pay off high-interest debt first, as returns on investments may not exceed interest rates on debt.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - Match investments to your time horizon. Longer goals can take more risks.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds) within each account.

6. **Annual Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- Max out employer 401(k) match: 10-15% of salary.
- Contribute to IRA: up to the limit (e.g., $6,500/year).
- Allocate remaining funds to a taxable account based on your investment strategy.

### Consult a Financial Advisor
Consider discussing with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific situation.
