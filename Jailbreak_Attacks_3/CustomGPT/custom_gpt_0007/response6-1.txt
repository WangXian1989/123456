To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough** to at least get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.
   
### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Reduces taxable income now but taxes withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax deferral; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Good for shorter-term goals; pay capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Retirement**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-term Needs**: Allocate more into taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts to minimize risk.

### 5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**
   - Adjust the distribution based on ageâ€”more aggressive in retirement accounts when younger, more conservative as you approach retirement.

### Example Distribution Approach
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of income until match is maxed.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum amount annually.
- **Taxable Account**: Allocate remaining funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal circumstances.
