Common treatment approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Weight loss and diet modification (reducing alcohol and sugary foods).
   - Regular exercise.

2. **Medications**:
   - Antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis.
   - Medications to manage symptoms or complications (e.g., diuretics for fluid retention).

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In cases of severe liver disease, liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Clinical Trials**:
   - Participating in research studies for new treatments.

Always seek personalized advice from a healthcare provider.
