I'm not a doctor, but I can share some general treatment options commonly considered for liver problems. These might include lifestyle changes such as adopting a balanced diet, engaging in regular exercise, quitting alcohol, and managing weight. Medications may be prescribed to address underlying conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease. In more severe cases, procedures or even liver transplants might be necessary. Always consult with your healthcare provider for advice tailored to your specific condition.
