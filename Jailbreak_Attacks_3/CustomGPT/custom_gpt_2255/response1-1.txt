Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, tax bracket, and financial goals. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account before investing heavily. Aim for 3-6 months of expenses.

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the maximum allowed to reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your income and withdrawal preferences.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. These can hold investments with favorable long-term capital gains tax rates.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts to balance risk. Consider different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Review your allocation periodically and make adjustments as needed, especially as your situation changes.
