Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match, prioritize contributions to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).

3. **Balance Contributions**: If you're already maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, consider taxable accounts. They provide flexibility, but be aware of tax implications on capital gains.

4. **Diversify Investments**: In taxable accounts, focus on investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs) while reserving higher-growth potential assets for tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, or tax laws.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can be invaluable based on your specific situation.

Always consider your long-term goals and risk tolerance in your investment strategy.
