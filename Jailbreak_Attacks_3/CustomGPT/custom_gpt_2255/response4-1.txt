The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, as this offers tax benefits and can help with retirement savings.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, contributing to a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions) may be beneficial.
   - For traditional accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA), contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your current taxable income.

3. **Diversification of Accounts**:
   - Having a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts gives you flexibility in retirement for withdrawals.
   - Taxable accounts can provide liquidity and be beneficial for short- to medium-term needs.

4. **Investment Strategies**:
   - Consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts since capital gains in these accounts are not taxed until withdrawal (or never for Roth accounts).
   - For taxable accounts, it may be wise to hold investments that are less tax-efficient (like bonds) to avoid paying taxes on large capital gains frequently.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation among accounts to ensure you’re aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Individual circumstances can vary widely, so consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.

This approach aims to balance growth potential while minimizing taxes over the long term.
