Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - If you have additional funds, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA, in particular, offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions:**
   - After maximizing your IRA contributions, focus on increasing your 401(k) contributions.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity. Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside (typically 3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing in any of these accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and changing financial goals.

### 7. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing from these accounts, especially in retirement. 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free.

### Conclusion:
The right distribution strategy can significantly impact your long-term wealth. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific situation.
