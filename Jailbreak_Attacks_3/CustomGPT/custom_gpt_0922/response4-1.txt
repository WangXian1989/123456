Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key considerations to optimize tax efficiency and retirement savings. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each account type and an approach to allocating your funds:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k):**
     - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing taxable income.
     - **Employer Matching:** Take full advantage of any employer match.
   - **Traditional IRA:**
     - **Tax Advantages:** Similar to a 401(k), with tax-deductible contributions, but with income limits.
   - **Roth IRA:**
     - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are post-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - **Flexibility:** No contribution limits or penalties for withdrawals, but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Distribution Strategy**
   - **Maximize Employer Match (401(k)):** Contribute enough to get the full match in your 401(k), as this is essentially free money.
   - **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
     - If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for long-term tax-free growth.
     - Contribute to a Traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals:**
     - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity, especially if you might need the funds before retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Hold lower-growth investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they may generate more taxable interest income.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your asset allocation annually to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### Example Allocation Approach (for a moderate risk profile):
- **401(k):** 50% of contributions, focusing on employer matching.
- **IRA/Roth IRA:** 25%, prioritizing the Roth for tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Accounts:** 25% for liquidity and short-term investments.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Personal Goals**
   - Consider your time horizon, risk tolerance, and retirement goals as these factors can shift the ideal distribution.

### Conclusion
Tailor this general approach to fit your specific financial situation and retirement goals, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
