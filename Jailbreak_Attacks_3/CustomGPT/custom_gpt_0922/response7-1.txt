Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Evaluate Contribution Limits and Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Max out contributions to receive any employer match first. The 2023 limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50+).
   - **IRA**: Contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth). The limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Contributions are made after-tax, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held here are subject to capital gains tax, but you can access funds without penalties.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - Consider higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where growth isn't taxed annually.
   - Place lower-risk or income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax hits on dividends or interest.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio remains diversified across different asset classes, even within each account type.

### 5. **Long-Term Goals**
   - Align your investment strategy with your retirement needs, considering when you plan to retire and your expected income needs.

### **General Distribution Strategy**
- **Max out 401(k) for employer match.**
- **Max out IRAs (consider a Roth IRA if eligible).**
- **Contribute remaining funds to a taxable account as needed.**

### **Conclusion**
Regularly review your strategy as your financial situation and market conditions change. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
