Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here can incur capital gains taxes on profits when sold, though long-term capital gains are generally taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Emergency Fund First:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments expected to grow significantly, as growth is either tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - Consider holding more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact from dividends and interest.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your asset allocation across all accounts to balance risk and optimize returns.

### 6. **Regular Review:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your contributions and allocations based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of your salary (max out if possible)
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount
- **Taxable Account**: Any additional savings after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts 

Consulting a financial advisor can tailor these strategies to suit your specific needs and situation.
