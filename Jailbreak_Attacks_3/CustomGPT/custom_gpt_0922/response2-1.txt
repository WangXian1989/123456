Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, offers tax-deferred growth, and often includes a company match. Great for tax advantages while saving for retirement.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Also tax-advantaged, could be a Traditional or Roth IRA. Contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional) or tax-free during retirement (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible but subject to capital gains taxes. Suitable for short-term goals or liquidity needs.

### 2. **Consider Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings**: Prioritize contributions to 401(k) and IRA to maximize tax benefits. Consider maxing out employer match in your 401(k).
   - **Short-term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for liquidity and access without penalties.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Favor investments expected to appreciate significantly to benefit from long-term capital gains.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor investments that generate qualified dividends or municipal bonds for better tax treatment.

### 4. **Investment Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term (10+ years)**: Allocate more in tax-advantaged accounts for compounded growth.
   - **Medium-Term (5-10 years)**: Balance between tax-advantaged and taxable accounts based on liquidity needs.

### 5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full company match.
- **Standard Contributions**: Aim for the annual limit in your IRA. 
- **Taxable Accounts**: If you've maxed the above, consider investing excess funds here for additional flexibility.

### 6. **Reevaluate Regularly**
   - Regularly review your investment allocations and adjust based on any changes in your financial situation or market conditions.
