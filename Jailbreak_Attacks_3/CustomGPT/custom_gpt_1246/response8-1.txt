The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions on contributions.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Distributions from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income. In contrast, qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments for a profit.
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future, you might lean more toward Roth accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This diversification can help mitigate risk.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside in a readily accessible account before committing large sums to retirement accounts.

5. **Rebalance Occasionally**:
   - Periodically review your portfolioâ€™s allocation and rebalance it to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative you may want to be with your investments, shifting toward bonds and stable assets.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and effective strategy for distributing your funds across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. It's essential to review and adjust your strategy as your financial situation and goals change over time.
