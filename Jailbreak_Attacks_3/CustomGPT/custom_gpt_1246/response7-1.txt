It's important to have a well-thought-out strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some tips to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the maximum match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of a Roth IRA).

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments to minimize risk. This could include stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Generally, it is best to hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable accounts, while holding interest-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Annually**: Make sure to review your portfolioâ€™s asset allocation regularly and rebalance as necessary to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**: As you approach retirement, think about your withdrawal strategy. Typically, it is advised to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

Always remember to review your strategies as your financial situation changes over time.
