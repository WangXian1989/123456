Optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some best practices to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize enough contributions to your 401(k) to take full advantage of the match—the "free money" can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - Ensure you're aware of the contribution limits for your 401(k). For 2023, the limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - After maximizing your employer match in the 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).
   - A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it attractive if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - A traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits if you deduct contributions from your taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, any additional savings can be allocated to taxable accounts.
   - This can be beneficial if you need liquidity for short-term goals, as these accounts aren't bound by contribution limits or withdrawal penalties.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across these accounts to balance potential growth and risk. Consider having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of the investments you hold in taxable accounts. For example, holding stocks that appreciate but do not pay dividends can reduce your tax burden.

5. **Reevaluate and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment strategy to adjust based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions.
   - Consider working with a financial advisor for tailored advice, especially regarding complex tax strategies.

By strategically distributing your investments across these accounts, you can maximize growth while minimizing tax liability.
