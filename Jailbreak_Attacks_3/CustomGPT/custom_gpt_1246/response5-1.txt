(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on several personal factors such as your age, risk tolerance, financial goals, and tax situation. Generally, you might consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a match, as this can provide immediate benefits. Next, contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) allows for additional tax-advantaged growth. Finally, taxable accounts can be useful for flexibility and accessing funds without penalty before retirement age. It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that meets your specific needs.
