To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you’re under 50, the contribution limit is $22,500 (as of 2023). Focus on contributing here next, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA (limit of $6,500). A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investing once you've maxed contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. They provide flexibility and liquidity, but be mindful of the tax implications on capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, focusing on growth-oriented investments.
   - **IRA**: Similar asset allocation as your 401(k), but consider investing in assets not available in your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds, ETFs, and tax-exempt bonds to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review your portfolio regularly to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your financial goals.

6. **Tax Planning**: Consider future tax implications when drawing from these accounts, especially in retirement.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor these strategies to your individual situation for optimal results.

This approach balances growth potential with tax efficiency while preparing for retirement.
