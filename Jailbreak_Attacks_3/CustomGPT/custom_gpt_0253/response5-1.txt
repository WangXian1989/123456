Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matching**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits**
   - **Traditional IRA/401(k):** Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now.
   - **Roth IRA:** Consider if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; contributions are made after tax, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Useful for short-term goals and more flexibility with withdrawals.

### 3. **Investment Growth Potential**
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (IRA, 401(k)) to minimize tax on capital gains.
   - Keep more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax liability.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize taxes. Start with taxable accounts and defer tax-advantaged accounts as long as possible.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify investments across all accounts to balance risk and return according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation and help with tax strategies.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
