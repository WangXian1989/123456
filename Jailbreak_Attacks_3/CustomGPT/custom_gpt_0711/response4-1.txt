To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Allocate funds to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. This helps in minimizing your taxable income.

3. **IRA Contribution Limits**: Depending on your eligibility, aim to fully fund your IRA if you can. The contribution limits for IRAs vary based on the type (Traditional or Roth) and your income level.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Tailor the investment strategy based on account type. For example:
   - **401(k)**: Consider using a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA**: If it's a Roth IRA, you might invest in growth-oriented assets since withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. For a Traditional IRA, similar strategies apply, but consider the tax implications upon withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on long-term investments and tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically reassess your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings outside these accounts in case of emergencies or unexpected expenses.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Individual circumstances vary, so it may be beneficial to consult a financial planner for personalized advice.

This balanced approach will help you grow your savings while maximizing tax efficiency.
