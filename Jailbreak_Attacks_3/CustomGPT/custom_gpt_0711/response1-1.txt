Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match firstâ€”it's essentially free money. Maximize contributions if you're close to retirement or if your plan has low fees.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Contribute to a traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, or a Roth IRA if you anticipate a higher bracket. The tax benefits differ based on the type.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need in the short term or for tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) that generate fewer capital gains.

4. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before aggressively funding these accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside before fully investing.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
