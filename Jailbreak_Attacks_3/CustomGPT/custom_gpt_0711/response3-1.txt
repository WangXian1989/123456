Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to secure the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k) for contributions, but there are income limits for tax-deductible contributions if you or your spouse are covered by a workplace retirement plan.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed as they are earned, and capital gains are taxed when assets are sold. This account offers flexibility but can have a higher tax burden.

3. **Diversification of Investments**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts. The specific asset allocation should align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Prioritize Contributions**: After maximizing your employer match, consider:
   - Contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible, due to the long-term tax benefits.
   - Continuing contributions to your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit.
   - Finally, invest in taxable accounts as needed for additional savings or short-term goals.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your investments and accounts to ensure that your distribution aligns with your goals, especially as your situation changes.
