Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):**
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's essentially free money).
     - If you're able, aim to max out contributions (for 2024, it's $23,000 if you're under 50, $30,000 if you're over).
   - **IRA:**
     - Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your income and tax strategy (the limit for 2024 is $6,500, or $7,500 if over 50).
     - Consider backdoor Roth contributions if you exceed income limits.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):**
     - Use for higher-growth investments (stocks, mutual funds) since you defer taxes.
   - **Roth IRA:**
     - Great for investments expected to appreciate significantly; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Invest in bonds, dividend-paying stocks, or index funds that generate low turnover to minimize taxable events.

### 3. **Consider Cash Flow Needs**
   - Keep some liquid cash in taxable accounts for short-term expenses or emergency funds.
   - Ensure you have enough in all accounts for planned withdrawals or lifestyle expenses.

### 4. **Evaluate Tax Strategies**
   - Hold investments generating capital gains in taxable accounts, and those generating ordinary income in tax-advantaged accounts to optimize your tax situation.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Adjust your asset allocation periodically based on market performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, especially regarding tax implications.

By thoughtfully balancing your contributions and investments across accounts, you can maximize growth while minimizing taxes.
