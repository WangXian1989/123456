   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars, rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying issue.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxins**: 
   - Eliminate alcohol and be cautious about exposure to chemicals that can harm the liver.

4. **Management of Underlying Conditions**: 
   - Conditions like diabetes, high cholesterol, and obesity should be well-managed.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.

6. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, such as cirrhosis or liver tumors, surgery or even a liver transplant might be necessary.

Always discuss these options with your doctor to create a tailored treatment plan based on your specific health situation.
