Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Preference for Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to accounts like your 401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth) due to their tax benefits:
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for savings that you might need before retirement or for specific short-term goals. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held here.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Choose your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider putting more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest and dividends.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically assess your overall asset allocation and investment performance. Rebalance as needed to ensure your distribution aligns with your retirement goals and market conditions.

Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
