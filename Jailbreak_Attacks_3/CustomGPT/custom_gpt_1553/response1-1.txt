Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider maxing out a traditional IRA (for potential tax deductions) or a Roth IRA (for tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or municipal bonds, which can help reduce your overall tax burden.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts are typically best for higher-growth, higher-tax investments since youâ€™ll defer taxes on any gains until withdrawal.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account before heavily investing.

5. **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on a well-diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and ensure you're maximizing your investments effectively.
