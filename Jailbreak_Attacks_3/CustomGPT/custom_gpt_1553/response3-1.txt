Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider this if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs can also provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxable. Use these for investments you plan to hold long-term to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth with a diversified mix of stocks and bonds. Younger investors might lean more toward equities for growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxable events.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquid savings outside of these accounts for emergencies before heavily investing.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts and adjust as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances and goals.

### General Allocation Example:
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of your income (max out up to match)
- **IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) annually if eligible
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining savings after maximizing retirement options

Make adjustments based on your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and financial goals.
