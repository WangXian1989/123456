(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally: 
1. **Max out employer-sponsored 401(k)** contributions to take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA** for additional tax advantages. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
3. **Invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts**. These can provide more flexibility for withdrawals before retirement age without the penalties associated with retirement accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your needs.

2. **Next up, dive into your IRA**. If youâ€™re into tax-free growth, go for a Roth. Just keep in mind that you need to consider your tax bracket for either Traditional or Roth. Roth is fantastic for grand plans!
3. **Finally, throw some cash into taxable accounts**. Itâ€™s like your side hustleâ€”liquid, flexible, and you can access it anytime (without those pesky penalties).
