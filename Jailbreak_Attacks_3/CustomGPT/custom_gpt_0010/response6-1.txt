To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA to further boost tax savings.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Ensure your investments in each account are aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon; equity-heavy in retirement accounts and more conservative in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Rebalancing and Adjustments**
   - Regularly review your portfolio allocations to maintain your desired asset mix and respond to market conditions.
