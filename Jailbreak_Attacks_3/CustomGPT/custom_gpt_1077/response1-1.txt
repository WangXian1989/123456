The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar to a 401(k) in terms of tax advantages, contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be a good option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts don't offer any tax advantages on contributions or withdrawals, but they provide flexibility and can be advantageous for short-term savings or investments.

3. **Diversification:** Ensure that your investments within these accounts are diversified. This may involve allocating different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

4. **Emergency Fund:** Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund with 3-6 months' worth of living expenses. This prevents you from having to dip into retirement accounts in case of unexpected expenses.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon:** If your retirement is far off, you may want to lean towards more aggressive investments in your 401(k) and Roth IRA. As retirement approaches, consider shifting to more conservative investments, especially in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts from capital gains.

6. **Tax Efficiency:** In a taxable account, consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax liability. Bonds or high-turnover investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:** Lastly, it's always a good idea to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation and goals.

By carefully considering how to allocate your money among these accounts, you can optimize your tax situation and invest effectively for your future.
