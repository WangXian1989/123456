When it comes to distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - If you aren't maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, prioritize these accounts to benefit from tax breaks.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - Keep track of the annual contribution limits for each account type to ensure you're maximizing benefits without exceeding limits.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, consider diversifying your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Generally, it may be beneficial to hold higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) and IRA) since they grow tax-deferred.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate income or dividends that may be taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Reassess your portfolio distribution periodically to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and the market environment.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If possible, speak to a financial professional to help tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Always remember, your personal circumstances can greatly influence the best approach, so it's vital to consider your overall financial picture.
