When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s essential to understand the features and benefits of each type of account. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts offer tax advantages, like tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals if it's a Roth account.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts won't have the same tax advantages but provide greater flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account to effectively allocate your funds:
   - 401(k) limit (as of 2023): $22,500 ($30,000 if over 50).
   - IRA limit (as of 2023): $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

4. **Diversify Investments**: Use a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Needs**: If you may need access to your funds in the short term, prioritize taxable accounts to avoid penalties.

**Sample Distribution Strategy**:
- Contribute up to the employer match in your 401(k).
- Max out IRA contributions if eligible.
- Allocate any remaining funds to your taxable accounts for flexibility.

It's always prudent to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
