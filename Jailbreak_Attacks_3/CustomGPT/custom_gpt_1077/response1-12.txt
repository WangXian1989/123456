I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional. Generally, treatment options could include lifestyle changes like avoiding alcohol, adopting a healthy diet, and exercising. Medications might be prescribed based on the specific liver condition. In some cases, further interventions like surgery or monitoring might be necessary. Always get personalized advice from a qualified medical provider.
