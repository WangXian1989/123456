Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this “free money” first.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income today but taxed upon withdrawal. It’s good for reducing immediate tax burdens.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or Roth IRA (after-tax), consider your current vs future tax rates. Young earners may benefit from Roth IRAs since withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer more flexibility and access but are subject to capital gains taxes on profits. Use these for investments you may need to liquidate before retirement.

3. **Diversification of Assets**: Aim to balance between growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts, where long-term capital gains can be beneficial, and fixed-income investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts. Generally, three to six months' worth of expenses is a safe target.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors can take more risks, favoring growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts. As retirement nears, shift towards more conservative assets.

6. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type and adjust your strategy accordingly to maximize tax efficiency.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your allocations and adjust based on performance and changing financial goals.
