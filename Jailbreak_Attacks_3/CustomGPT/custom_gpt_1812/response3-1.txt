To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full amount. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Roth IRA:** If you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial since contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Traditional IRA/401(k):** These accounts provide tax deductions upfront, which might be better if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Consider Your Investment Horizon:**
   - Allocate more funds to growth-oriented investments in accounts with longer time horizons (like a 401(k)).
   - For shorter-term goals, keep more funds in taxable accounts to access them without penalties.

4. **Diversify Your Investments:**
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts, taking into account asset allocation that fits your risk tolerance.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your portfolio and adjust allocations based on performance and changing financial goals, ensuring that you maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice that considers your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and effective approach to managing your investments across different account types.
