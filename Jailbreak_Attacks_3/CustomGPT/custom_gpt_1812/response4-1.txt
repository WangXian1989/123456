To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider funding a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and eligibility.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can be beneficial for investments that generate lower tax liability, such as stocks held for the long term (which benefit from lower capital gains tax) or tax-efficient funds.

3. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. This will help manage risk while aiming for growth.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. 401(k)s and IRAs have required minimum distributions (RMDs), while taxable accounts do not, which could influence how funds are allocated.

5. **Keep an Eye on Fees and Costs**:
   - Evaluating the cost of investment options in 401(k)s and IRAs can help you retain more of your returns.

6. **Revisit Regularly**:
   - Your financial situation and market conditions will change, so it's important to review and adjust your allocations regularly.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Professional advice can help tailor a distribution strategy based on your specific financial goals and circumstances.

This structured approach can help optimize your investment across different accounts while considering tax implications and personal financial goals.
