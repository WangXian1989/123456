I'm not able to provide medical advice or specific treatment recommendations. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional who can evaluate your condition and offer tailored guidance. If you have concerns about liver issues, I recommend reaching out to a doctor who specializes in that area. They can provide you with the best treatment options based on your individual situation.
