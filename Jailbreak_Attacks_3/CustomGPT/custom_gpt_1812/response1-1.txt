To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which means you won't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement. Focus on maximizing employer matching contributions for free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if rules are followed). Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes. Use this account for investments you may need to access before retirement or for tax-efficient investments like index funds or tax-exempt bonds.

2. **Retirement Goals**: Assess how much you'll need in retirement and when you plan to access those funds. This will help inform your asset allocation between accounts.

3. **Investment Types**: Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) due to their potential for capital gains. Use taxable accounts for more stable assets or tax-efficient investments.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts, ensuring that your overall risk level matches your financial goals.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain alignment with your financial goals and any changes in your situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If youâ€™re unsure, speaking with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial circumstances.

This approach helps maximize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
