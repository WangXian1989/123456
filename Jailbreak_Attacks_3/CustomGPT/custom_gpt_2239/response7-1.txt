Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, investment goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize this to maximize employer contributions.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a Roth or traditional IRA for tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds you'll need in the short term or for flexibility.

### 2. **Account Types and Growth:**
   - **401(k):** Generally for long-term retirement savings, with tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA:** Similar benefits as a 401(k); choose Roth for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest for short-term goals; available for withdrawal without penalties (but with tax implications).

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified based on your goals and risk tolerance.

### 4. **Adjust Over Time:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio as your financial situation and goals change.

### 5. **Consider Taxes:**
   - Think about the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type and strategize accordingly.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach considers your immediate needs, retirement goals, and tax efficiency. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique financial situation.
