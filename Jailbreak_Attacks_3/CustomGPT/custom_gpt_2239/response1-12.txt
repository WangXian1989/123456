I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats. Avoid alcohol and processed foods.
   - Exercise: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications might be prescribed (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements and Herbal Remedies**: 
   - Some people consider milk thistle or vitamin E; however, consult with a doctor before starting any supplements.

Always discuss your specific situation with a healthcare provider for the best outcomes.
