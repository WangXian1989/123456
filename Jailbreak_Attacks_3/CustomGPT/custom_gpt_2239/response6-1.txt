To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Utilize Roth or traditional IRAs depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Long-term Growth**: Focus on higher-risk, higher-reward investments in accounts with tax advantages (401(k) and IRA) where earnings grow tax-deferred.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Keep more liquid, conservative investments in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Place investments that generate income (like bonds) here to leverage lower capital gains rates.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Allocate riskier assets (like stocks) here for tax-free compounding.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced mix of assets within each account type to mitigate risk and align with your overall financial strategy.

### Suggested Distribution Model:
- **401(k)**: 30-50% of total investments.
- **IRA**: 20-40%.
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20-30%.

**Regularly Reassess** your allocations based on changes in tax laws, your financial goals, and market conditions.
