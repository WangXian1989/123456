Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Consider maxing it out if you can.
   - **IRA**: Use a Roth IRA if you expect higher taxes in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. A Traditional IRA may be preferable if you want tax deductions now.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so consider placing investments with high appreciation potential there.
   - Interest-generating assets, like bonds or dividend stocks, may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Ensure proper asset allocation across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Stocks might be more suitable for long-term growth if you're younger, while bonds may fit better for preservation if you're closer to retirement.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when you will withdraw funds, as this can influence how much you should keep in each account type. Generally, itâ€™s wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide tailored advice based on your individual circumstances and help you create a balanced strategy.

By considering these factors, you can develop a distribution strategy that aligns with your long-term financial objectives.
