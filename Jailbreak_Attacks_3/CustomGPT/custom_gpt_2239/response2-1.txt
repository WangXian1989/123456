To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investment strategies with favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains. Focus on tax-efficient investments to minimize tax impact.

3. **Investment Types**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Invest in growth-oriented funds, as these accounts provide tax benefits that compound growth over time.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider income-generating investments (e.g., dividends) cautiously, as these will be taxed annually.

4. **Emergency Funds**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in cash or short-term savings before heavily investing in these accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Align your investments with your risk tolerance and financial goals across all accounts. Maintain a balanced allocation between stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your investments annually to ensure your allocations still align with your strategy, especially after significant market movements.

7. **Consider Future Goals**:
   - Think about your retirement age and lifestyle desires to determine how aggressively to invest vs. preserving capital.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts while considering your overall investment strategy, you can create a balanced approach to grow your wealth effectively.
