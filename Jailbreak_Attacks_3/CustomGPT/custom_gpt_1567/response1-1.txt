Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; it's free money!
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held longer than a year.

3. **Investment Diversification**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher-growth investments (stocks), as they benefit from tax deferral.
   - Consider holding more stable investments like bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts for better tax efficiency.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquid savings outside these accounts before heavily investing.

5. **Regular Review**: Monitor and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice specific to your situation.
