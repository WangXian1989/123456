Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires considering several factors. Here’s a guideline to help you decide:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's free money. Consider maxing this out if you’re in a high tax bracket, as contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are useful for investing flexibility and liquidity. Consider keeping investments with lower turnover and qualified dividends to minimize taxes.
   - **Income Needs:** If you need regular withdrawals before retirement, taxable accounts allow for easier access without penalties.

### 3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts; these accounts benefit most from compound growth.
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Keep more stable, liquid investments in taxable accounts to avoid penalties and volatility.

### Additional Considerations
- **Diversification:** Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.
- **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement for tax efficiency.

By focusing on tax-advantaged accounts first and tailoring your investments to your needs, you can optimize your financial strategy effectively.
