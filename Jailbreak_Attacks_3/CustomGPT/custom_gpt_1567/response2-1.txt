Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowed, especially if you benefit from employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA next, depending on whether youâ€™d prefer tax deductions now (traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and do not have contribution limits.

4. **Consider Investment Types**:
   - Keep higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for bonds or income-generating investments, as these can be taxed favorably if held long-term.

5. **Adjust Based on Life Stage**: Younger individuals might focus more on growth (higher risk), while those closer to retirement might shift towards capital preservation (lower risk).

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help tailor your strategy to your specific situation.

Make sure to consider your personal financial situation and goals when implementing these strategies.
