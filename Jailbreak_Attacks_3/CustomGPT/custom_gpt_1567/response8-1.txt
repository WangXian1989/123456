Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify; it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're eligible for a traditional IRA, it provides a tax deduction upfront.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for short-term goals or emergencies since you can access them without penalties.
   - Keep an eye on capital gains taxes when investing in taxable accounts. Favor tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs.

### 3. Consider Your Timeline:
   - If retirement is far off, focus more on tax-advantaged accounts to grow your investments tax-free.
   - For near-term goals (like buying a home), lean on your taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 4. Diversification:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk. Different accounts can hold varied asset allocations to optimize performance.

### 5. Regularly Review and Adjust:
   - Periodically review your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, market conditions, and life events.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out any employer match, then consider contributing to a Roth if eligible.
- **IRA**: If you can, contribute the maximum annual limit to either a traditional or Roth IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use excess funds for short-term goals or to take advantages of specific investments.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
