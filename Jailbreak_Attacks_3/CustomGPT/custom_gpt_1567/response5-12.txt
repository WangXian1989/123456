I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about treatment options for liver issues. Itâ€™s important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Eating a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can significantly help liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the underlying issue (like hepatitis or fatty liver), specific medications may be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping track of liver function through regular blood tests can help manage the condition.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for the best course of action for your specific situation.
