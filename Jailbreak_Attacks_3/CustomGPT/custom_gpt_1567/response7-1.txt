Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions, essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - After maximizing the match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

### 3. **Continue with 401(k) Contributions**
   - If you can, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This is especially beneficial if you are in a higher tax bracket.

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. They offer flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

### 5. **Consider Asset Location**
   - Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

### 6. **Adjust Based on Goals**
   - Regularly review your strategy based on changing financial goals, life circumstances, and market conditions.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider speaking with a financial planner to tailor your distribution strategy to your unique situation.

### Summary
Prioritize employer matches, then focus on retirement accounts before taxable accounts. Adjust based on your goals and consult a professional as needed.
