When considering the optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to understand the advantages and limitations of each account type. Here are several strategies to help you allocate your funds effectively:

### 1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially free money, and prioritizing this will give you an immediate return on your investment.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA next. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income.

### 2. **Consider your tax situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts provide flexibility, as you can access the funds without penalties, but be aware that you will be responsible for capital gains taxes when selling investments.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Regardless of where your money sits, diversify your investments within each account to manage risk effectively. Allocate funds among stocks, bonds, and alternative investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly rebalance your portfolio across all account types to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Conclusion
By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and carefully considering your tax situation, you can create a balanced and strategic approach to managing your finances. Tailoring your investment strategy to your personal circumstances will maximize growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities over the long term.
