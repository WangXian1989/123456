Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is effectively free money and a great way to start.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify for a traditional or Roth IRA, consider contributing to this next. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions upfront.

3. **Continue with Your 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, keep contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the maximum yearly contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings**: If you still have extra funds after maximizing retirement account contributions, consider a taxable brokerage account. This can give you more flexibility for investments and withdrawals, although you'll be liable for capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification of Investments**: Within each account, ensure that you are diversifying your investments (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations and investment performance, and adjust as necessary to stay aligned with your goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the plan specifically to your personal situation and financial goals.
