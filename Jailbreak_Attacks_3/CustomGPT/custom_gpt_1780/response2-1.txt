It's important to develop a well-balanced strategy for distributing your money across various accounts like your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income. If your 401(k) has a Roth option, consider whether after-tax contributions would be beneficial for your long-term goals.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth) based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits (for 2023, it's $6,500 with an additional $1,000 for those over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility since you can access funds without penalties, unlike retirement accounts which may have withdrawal restrictions.
   - **Tax Strategy**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments; consider holding investments for more than a year to benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Consider having a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment time horizon.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations as needed to stay aligned with your financial goals.

5. **Emergency Funds and Debt**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before maximizing contributions to these accounts, and pay down high-interest debt effectively.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If possible, working with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation, especially regarding tax implications.

Ultimately, the right distribution depends on your individual financial situation, investment goals, and timeline. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for a personalized plan.
