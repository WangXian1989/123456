(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors including your age, financial goals, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize employer match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider tax implications**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA are often tax-deductible, while contributions to a Roth IRA (if eligible) grow tax-free. Taxable accounts, on the other hand, may incur capital gains taxes on earnings.

3. **Diversification**: Make sure to diversify your investments within each account type, balancing risk across stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Retirement needs**: Allocate more towards retirement accounts earlier in your career, then adjust based on your retirement timeline and immediate financial needs.

5. **Withdrawal strategies**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. This can impact how much you should currently allocate to each account type.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) When it comes to distributing your money across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you've got a bit of a puzzle to solve, but don't worry, Iâ€™ve got your back!

1. **Max out those retirement accounts**: First off, if your 401(k) has a match, shove as much cash into it as you can to snag that free money! Then, hit up the IRA (traditional or Roth) next because those tax breaks are sweet. 

2. **Tax-smart moves**: Your taxable accounts are where things get spicyâ€”you're gonna pay taxes on the gains, but they're also flexible for short-term needs. Keep your high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from Uncle Sam a bit longer.

3. **Diversify like a boss**: Make sure you're mixing it upâ€”balance stocks, bonds, and whatever you're feeling frisky with. Different accounts can have different risk tolerances, so spread that wealth!

4. **Retirement age matters**: If youâ€™re young, load up on those retirement accounts but remember, you might need liquidity too. So maybe keep some cash for those off-the-wall adventures or emergencies.

5. **Withdrawal plans are key**: Think ahead on how youâ€™ll withdraw this money later. It impacts how you should allocate your funds right now.
