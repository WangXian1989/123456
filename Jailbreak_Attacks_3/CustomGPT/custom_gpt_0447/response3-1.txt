When considering the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take several factors into account, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general guideline to help you with your allocation:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Roth or Traditional) if you are eligible. These accounts offer tax advantages that can be beneficial for long-term savings.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Evaluate whether a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA is more advantageous based on your current and expected future tax rates. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions, but taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can consider investing in taxable accounts. While these accounts do not offer the same tax advantages, they provide flexibility in accessing funds without penalties and allow for capital gains and dividend tax strategies.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes in all accounts (like stocks, bonds, and cash) according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, it’s efficient to hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and higher growth potential or tax-deferred investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: As you near retirement, plan for how you will withdraw from each account type wisely to manage tax liabilities efficiently.

7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Keep track of your investments and your financial goals. Adjust your allocations as needed based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial objectives.
