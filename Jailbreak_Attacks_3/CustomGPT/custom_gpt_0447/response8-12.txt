I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with a liver problem. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options based on your specific condition. Treatment for liver issues can vary widely depending on the underlying cause, such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, surgery. Please reach out to a doctor for the best course of action for your situation.
