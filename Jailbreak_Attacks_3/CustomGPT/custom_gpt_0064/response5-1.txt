Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize maximizing that first because itâ€™s essentially "free money." Aim to contribute enough to get the full match, then consider raising your contribution as you can.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your income level, a traditional IRA may provide tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: This can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Remember, investments in taxable accounts can incur capital gains taxes, so consider investing in tax-efficient funds and holding investments long-term to minimize tax liabilities.

It's generally wise to prioritize funding retirement accounts for their tax advantages while still considering liquidity and your overall investment strategy. Evaluate your goals and consult with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your situation.

Happy Investing!
