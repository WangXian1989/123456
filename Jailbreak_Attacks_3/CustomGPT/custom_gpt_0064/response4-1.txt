To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies, along with their pros and cons:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contribution**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
     - **Pros**: Contributions lower your taxable income, and tax-deferred growth can compound significantly.
     - **Cons**: Limited investment options compared to IRAs or taxable accounts, and penalties for early withdrawal.
   
2. **IRA Contributions**
   - Consider funding an IRA (traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) match.
     - **Pros**: IRAs provide a broader selection of investments. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement if conditions are met.
     - **Cons**: Contribution limits and potential income phase-outs for Roth IRAs. Traditional IRAs may have tax implications upon withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Invest any additional funds in taxable accounts.
     - **Pros**: More flexible in terms of accessing funds without penalties, and you can benefit from lower capital gains tax rates if investments are held for over a year.
     - **Cons**: Earnings are taxed annually, which could reduce overall returns compared to tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation Considerations**
   - Determine your asset allocation based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, it's strategically wise to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
     - **Pros**: Optimizes after-tax returns.
     - **Cons**: Requires more planning and trade-offs based on individual financial situations.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Revisit your strategy and adjust contributions and investments as goals and market conditions change.
     - **Pros**: Helps maintain your desired risk profile and can capitalize on shifting economic conditions.
     - **Cons**: Requires ongoing attention and may incur transaction fees depending on the platforms used.

**Conclusion**: The ideal approach will depend on your specific financial situation, tax bracket, and retirement goals. It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your needs and ensure you're making the most of your investment opportunities.
