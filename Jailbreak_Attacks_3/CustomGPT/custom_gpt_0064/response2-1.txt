Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a breakdown of the pros and cons of each option to help you decide:

### 401(k)
**Pros:**
- **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Many employers also offer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
- **Higher Contribution Limits:** 401(k)s typically have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

**Cons:**
- **Limited Investment Choices:** You're usually limited to the investment options offered by your employer’s plan.
- **Withdrawal Restrictions:** Penalties may apply if you withdraw funds before age 59½.

### IRA (Traditional or Roth)
**Pros:**
- **Tax Flexibility:** Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **More Investment Choices:** You can choose from a wider variety of investments compared to most 401(k) plans.

**Cons:**
- **Lower Contribution Limits:** IRAs have lower annual contribution limits compared to 401(k)s.
- **Income Limits for Roth IRA:** High earners may not be able to contribute to a Roth IRA directly.

### Taxable Accounts
**Pros:**
- **Liquidity:** You can access money anytime without penalties or restrictions, making it a flexible option.
- **Variety of Investments:** You can invest in a wide range of assets, including stocks, bonds, and real estate.

**Cons:**
- **Tax Implications:** You’ll owe capital gains taxes on profits, which can reduce your overall return compared to tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Potential for Higher Tax Rate:** Income generated from investments may be taxed at a higher rate than funds in retirement accounts.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
1. **Max out employer match on your 401(k):** This is essentially free money and should be your first priority.
2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Depending on your tax situation, choose a Traditional or Roth IRA.
3. **Increase 401(k) contributions:** After maxing out your IRA, go back to your 401(k).
4. **Use taxable accounts for additional savings:** Invest any extra savings here, keeping in mind the tax implications.

### Final Thoughts
Consider your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and tax bracket when determining your distribution. It might also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your individual circumstances.

Happy Investing!
