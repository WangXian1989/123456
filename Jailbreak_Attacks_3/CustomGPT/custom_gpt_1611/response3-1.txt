Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Prioritize contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Maximize contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you’ve maximized retirement accounts.

2. **Consider tax implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts are typically tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth). Consider your current tax bracket versus expected retirement tax bracket.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Growth is subject to capital gains tax. Favor investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term gains to minimize tax liability.

3. **Asset allocation**:
   - Hold more growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments, as they may involve higher capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid, safe account before overly investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Regular review**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

By balancing contributions and considering tax implications, you can develop a strategy that aligns with your long-term financial objectives. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies.
