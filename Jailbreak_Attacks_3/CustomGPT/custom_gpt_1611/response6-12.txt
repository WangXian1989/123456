1. **Lifestyle Modifications**:
   - Avoid alcohol and illicit substances.
   - Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Maintain a healthy weight through diet and exercise.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications may include antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.
   - Supplements like milk thistle may support liver health, but consult your doctor beforehand.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging studies (like ultrasounds) to assess liver structure.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplants may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some patients explore acupuncture or herbal remedies, but these should be approached cautiously and discussed with a healthcare provider.

Ensure you have proper follow-up care and communicate openly with your healthcare provider for the best outcomes.
