To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth; ideal for employer matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Provides tax advantages, either tax-deferred (traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility for withdrawals; taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions before adding more to your 401(k). The contribution limits for IRAs are generally lower, so maximizing these can provide significant tax benefits.

### 4. **Balance Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investment mix (stocks, bonds, etc.) across accounts based on your risk tolerance and goals. Consider placing higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - In taxable accounts, favor investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact. Use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 7. **Consider Future Tax Implications**:
   - Think about your current and projected future tax rates. You might prefer to withdraw from tax-deferred accounts in years when you expect to be in a lower tax bracket.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation and long-term goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Max contribution to employer match.
2. **IRA**: Contribute the full IRA limit.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds with a focus on tax-efficient investments.

By following these strategic principles, you can optimize the growth and effectiveness of your retirement savings and investment strategy.
