Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA for additional tax-deferred growth.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as qualified dividends and long-term gains are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Utilize for income-generating investments to defer taxes until withdrawal.

3. **Asset Allocation Philosophy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Align your investment choices within each account based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Growth vs. Income**: Place higher-risk, growth-oriented investments in tax-deferred accounts and income-focused investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy Planning**:
   - **Future Withdrawals**: Consider the order of withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes.
   - **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**: Keep in mind RMD rules for retirement accounts when planning your future distributions.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changing goals, and any life events.

This strategic approach will optimize your investments while minimizing tax liabilities over time.
