When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guide to help you structure your investments effectively:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Max out contributions if you can afford it.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Contribute to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, so they can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Money contributes to 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs can lower your taxable income now since contributions are made pre-tax.
   - **Post-Tax Accounts:** Roth IRAs involve contributions made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are useful for additional savings or short-term goals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

### 3. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Within these accounts, ensure your investments are diversified across several asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and cash. The percentage in each should reflect your risk tolerance and timeline.
   - **Rebalancing:** Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 4. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Be strategic about tax implications when it comes time to withdraw funds. Typically, pulling from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts can be beneficial.

### 5. **Regular Contributions**
   - Make regular contributions to each account type to build wealth over time and take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

### Example Distribution Plan
| Account Type | Contribution Strategy                   |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| 401(k)       | Maximize employer match; aim for maximum contribution limit when feasible. |
| IRA          | Contribute to both Traditional and Roth IRA if eligible, based on income level and retirement goals. |
| Taxable      | Use for excess savings; consider investing in index funds or ETFs to minimize taxes on capital gains. |

### Conclusion
It's essential to review your individual financial situation periodically or consult a financial advisor for tailored advice, as personal circumstances can significantly impact the best distribution strategy.
