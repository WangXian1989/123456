When it comes to distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s crucial to consider several factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to help you strategize your investment distribution:

### **1. Understand the Accounts**

| Account Type  | Key Features | Tax Implications |
|---------------|--------------|------------------|
| **401(k)**    | Employer-sponsored, potential matching contributions | Pre-tax contributions reduce taxable income; taxed upon withdrawal |
| **IRA**       | Individual retirement account, various types (Traditional, Roth) | Tax benefits depend on type; Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals |
| **Taxable Accounts** | Flexible investment options, no tax advantages | Taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains |

### **2. Consider Your Financial Goals**

- **Short-term Goals**: If you need liquidity or plan to access funds in the near term, prioritize taxable accounts. These allow for immediate access without penalty.
- **Long-term Goals**: For retirement savings, maximize contributions to your 401(k) (especially if thereâ€™s a matching contribution from your employer) and IRAs for tax advantages.

### **3. Proposed Distribution Strategy**

1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available (often around 5-6%).

2. **Invest in IRA**:
   - Aim to maximize contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on eligibility), as this offers great tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Investment Accounts**:
   - After maximizing 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider allocating funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and the ability to withdraw without penalties.

### **4. Review Annually**

- Adjust your strategy based on changes in income, expenses, tax laws, and financial goals.

### **5. Consult with a Financial Advisor**

- A personalized approach can help you navigate complex financial situations and choose the best allocation for your circumstances.

### **Conclusion**

Distributing money across these accounts wisely is essential for long-term financial health. Consider your current situation and future goals, and revisit this strategy regularly to stay on track.
