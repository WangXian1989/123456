To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
  - Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax benefits.
  
- **Understand Contribution Limits**:
  - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type to optimize tax efficiencies.

- **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
  - Allocate more to tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
  - Use taxable accounts for money you might need in the short term, as they provide easy access without penalties.

- **Diversification**:
  - Maintain a balanced investment strategy across all accounts, distributing investments to reduce risk.

- **Withdrawal Strategies**:
  - Plan for future withdrawals; consider the tax implications of pulling from each account type.

- **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
  - Seek personalized advice to align your investment strategy with your financial goals and tax situation.

This balanced approach can help you manage taxes and grow your retirement savings effectively.
