To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

- **Maximize Employer Match**: 
  - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

- **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts Effectively**:
  - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
  - **IRA**: Choose between Traditional (tax-deductible) and Roth (after-tax) based on your tax situation and retirement timeline. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

- **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
  - Invest in more tax-efficient assets (like index funds) to minimize capital gains exposure. Consider holding bonds and REITs in tax-advantaged accounts.

- **Asset Allocation Strategy**:
  - Maintain a diversified portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Allocate higher-risk assets (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts to maximize tax-free growth.

- **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
  - As you approach retirement, strategize withdrawals to minimize tax implications, starting from taxable accounts and delaying tax-deferred withdrawals.

- **Regular Review**: 
  - Periodically assess your portfolio to align with changing goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor may also provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique financial situation.
