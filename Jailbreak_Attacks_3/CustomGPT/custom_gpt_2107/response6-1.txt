To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
  - Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match, if availableâ€”this is essentially "free money."
  - Aim to maximize contributions to IRAs (both Traditional and Roth) for tax benefits.

- **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
  - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes on dividends and realized gains.
  - Use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains in taxable accounts.

- **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
  - Plan for retirement withdrawals based on tax implications, potentially withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred growth in 401(k) and IRA.

- **Diversify Across Accounts**:
  - Maintain a balanced investment strategy across all accounts, adjusting asset allocation based on risk tolerance and investment goals.

- **Reassess Regularly**:
  - Periodically review account performance and tax implications to adjust contributions and reallocations as needed. 

This approach ensures that you benefit from tax advantages while maintaining flexibility and growth in your investment strategy.
