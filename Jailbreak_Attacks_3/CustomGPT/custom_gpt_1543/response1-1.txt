Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategy that considers your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Investment Choices:** Assess the available investment options and fees in your plan.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Good for tax-deferred growth; contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits and eligibility requirements based on income.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity:** Good for short-term goals, as funds can be accessed without penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax impact.

4. **General Strategy:**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund before investing heavily.
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired level of risk.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Tailoring a strategy specific to your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance can provide valuable insights and help you make informed decisions.

Balancing these elements can help optimize your tax benefits and growth potential.
