Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are key considerations:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Contributions**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer matches. This is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose a mix of investments that align with your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible. Best if you anticipate lower taxes in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investment Strategy**: Use for investments that may generate high taxable income (like bonds) or short-term gains. Consider tax-efficient funds to minimize tax impact.
   - **Flexibility**: Provides liquidity and allows access to funds without penalties, making it useful for short-term goals.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:
1. **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with your 401(k) to get the employer match, then contribute to either IRA (choose based on tax considerations).
2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Once you meet your employer match, focus on maxing out your IRA before putting additional funds in the 401(k).
3. **Invest Remaining Funds**: Finally, allocate any surplus funds to your taxable account for flexibility and liquidity.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 15% (if employer match available)
- **IRA (Roth/Traditional)**: 10-15%
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remainder based on your financial goals and liquidity needs.

Review your allocations annually and adjust based on changing needs, market conditions, and retirement goals. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
