Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Assess Contributions Limits**
   - **401(k):** Maximize employer match if available; the contribution limit is higher than IRAs.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, considering tax implications; the limit is lower than 401(k).

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Impact**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income in the contribution year. Taxes apply when withdrawing during retirement.
   - **IRA:** Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible. Roth IRA contributions are after-tax, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Taxed annually on dividends and capital gains. Useful for short-term goals or flexibility.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Maximize growth potential in tax-deferred accounts (e.g., stocks, high-growth funds).
   - **Income Investments in Taxable Accounts:** Hold bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to manage tax efficiency.

### Suggested Distribution (Example)
- **401(k):** 40% (max out contributions with employer match)
- **IRA:** 20% (prioritize Roth IRA if eligible for tax-free withdrawals)
- **Taxable Account:** 40% (for liquidity and short-term investments)

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Reassess your portfolio allocation annually to align with changing goals and market conditions.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized strategies tailored to your financial situation, though ensure they’re aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

This strategy enhances tax efficiency and aligns your investments with both short- and long-term objectives.
