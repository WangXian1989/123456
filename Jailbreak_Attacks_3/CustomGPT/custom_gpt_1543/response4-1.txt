Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is effectively “free money.” Consider maxing it out if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

2. **Prioritize Taxable Accounts Last**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for savings beyond the contributions allowed in tax-advantaged accounts or for specific short-term goals. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Investment Choices**:
   - Within each account, choose investments based on their tax efficiency. For example, consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts since they generate ordinary income, while stocks that may generate qualified dividends can be more tax-efficient in taxable accounts.

4. **Evaluate Your Investment Goals**: 
   - For retirement, focus on long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, ensure your taxable accounts are liquid and accessible.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: 
   - Re-evaluate your distribution strategy annually or when significant life changes occur. Adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation.
