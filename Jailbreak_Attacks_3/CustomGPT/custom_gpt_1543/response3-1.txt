Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to this first, especially if you have a company match. It reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA next, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   
3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a Traditional 401(k) or IRA might be more beneficial to lower your current taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA could be advantageous.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure your investments are well-diversified across asset classes, regardless of account type. Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. They offer liquidity and flexibility, though you'll pay taxes on capital gains and dividends.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your allocations to ensure they align with your changing financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

This approach aims to balance tax efficiency with your investment goals, optimizing your retirement savings strategy.
