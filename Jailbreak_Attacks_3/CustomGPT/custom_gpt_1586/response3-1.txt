Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits:**
   - Make sure you are aware of the contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA accounts. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is generally $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it’s essentially "free money."

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Focus on maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first before contributing to taxable accounts. This helps minimize your current taxable income and allows your investments to grow tax-deferred.

4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxable as income. Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing more to Roth accounts.

5. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Determine your risk tolerance and investment strategy. It’s common to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts since you won’t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal, while more conservative investments can be held in taxable accounts.

6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund set aside in a readily accessible account, separate from your investment accounts.

7. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and account types to mitigate risk.

8. **Review Regularly:**
   - Regularly review your portfolio and asset allocation based on your changing financial situation and market conditions.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances and financial goals.
