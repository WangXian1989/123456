The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Max out employer-sponsored 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Traditional or Roth IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable accounts**: If you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility, but you'll pay capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Consider your tax bracket**: If you're in a lower tax bracket now, contributing to a Roth IRA may be advantageous since you'll pay taxes upfront at a lower rate.

5. **Diversify your investments**: Regardless of the accounts, ensure that your investments are well-diversified to manage risk.

6. **Reassess regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so regularly revisit and adjust your distribution strategy as needed.
