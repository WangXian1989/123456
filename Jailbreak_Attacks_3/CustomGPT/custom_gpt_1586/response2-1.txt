Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA. This is especially beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as a Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals.
   - Consider after-tax contributions to your 401(k) if your plan allows it and you're looking for additional tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, which tend to incur lower capital gains taxes. This is also a good place for emergency funds or funds you might need access to within a few years.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, it might be advantageous to focus more on tax-deferred accounts (like the 401(k) and traditional IRA). If you're in a lower bracket, a Roth IRA may be more attractive.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Annually review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal finance is complex, and a professional can tailor advice to your specific situation, including considerations for estate planning, emergency funds, and tax strategies.

By taking these steps, you can create a balanced and efficient investment strategy across your accounts.
