The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on multiple factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great first step.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred (401(k)) or tax-free (Roth IRA). Aim to max out contributions to these accounts if possible.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, traditional accounts might be more beneficial due to their immediate tax deduction.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund (generally 3-6 months' worth of expenses) in a savings account.

5. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals but come with capital gains taxes on any profits.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Regularly review your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance.

Adjustments may need to be made based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
