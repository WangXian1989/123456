Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If you're contributing to a 401(k), first ensure you're contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year. Taxes are paid when you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar tax benefits as a 401(k) for traditional IRAs; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax on profits when you sell, and dividends are taxed as income.

3. **Consider Retirement Timeline:**
   - If you're closer to retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to reduce taxes on withdrawals.
   - If you have a longer time horizon, you might consider investing more in taxable accounts for greater flexibility and tax efficiency.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure that your investment choices within each account type are diversified to manage risk.

5. **Proportional Distribution:** A common strategy is to allocate a higher percentage to tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) and a smaller percentage to taxable accounts. 

6. **Regular Review:** Reassess your allocation periodically based on changes in income, tax laws, or personal circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Given the complexities of tax laws and personal finance, seek advice tailored to your specific situation.

This balanced approach can help you maximize growth while minimizing tax burdens over time.
