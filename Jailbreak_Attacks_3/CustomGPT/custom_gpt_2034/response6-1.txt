To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

### Key Considerations for Distribution

1. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Understand the annual contribution limits for each account type.
   - Max out the employer match in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, whereas investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax.
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals during retirement, which can be beneficial.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and investment timeline for each account.
   - Long-term investments might benefit from higher exposure to equities, whereas short-term goals should focus on safer assets.

### Suggested Distribution Strategies

- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
  - Focus on contributing enough to receive the full employer match.
  - Consider increasing contributions as you receive raises.

- **Allocate to Traditional IRA or Roth IRA**:
  - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
  - Utilize traditional IRAs if you seek a tax deduction now.

- **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
  - Keep more liquid investments or those with short-term horizons in taxable accounts.
  - Consider tax-efficient funds to minimize tax liability.

### Example Distribution

- **60% to 401(k)** for employer match and tax-deferred growth.
- **20% to Roth IRA** for tax-free growth potential.
- **20% to Taxable Accounts** for liquidity and flexibility.

By focusing on employer matching, tax implications, and investment goals, you can create a balanced and effective distribution strategy that serves your financial future. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal circumstances.
