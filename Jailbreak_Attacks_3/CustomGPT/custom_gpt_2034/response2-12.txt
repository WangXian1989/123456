2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the underlying condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms and slow disease progression. Examples include antiviral medications for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests and imaging studies are necessary to monitor liver function and assess the progression of the disease.

4. **Surgical Options**:
   - In severe cases, surgical interventions may be necessary, including liver transplantation or procedures to remove bile ducts obstructions or tumors.

5. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some individuals may explore herbal remedies or supplements for liver health (e.g., milk thistle), but it's crucial to discuss these with a healthcare provider, as they can interact with medications.

Always prioritize professional medical advice tailored to your specific situation.
