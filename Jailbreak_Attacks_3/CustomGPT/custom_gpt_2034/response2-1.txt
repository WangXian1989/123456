Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations and strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the years you contribute. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell investments.

2. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (usually 3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

3. **Contribute to Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money” and a great place to start.

4. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Aim to max out your contributions to IRAs and 401(k)s if possible, as these accounts provide tax benefits.

5. **Invest Based on Time Horizon**:
   - If you’re far from retirement, you can typically take on more risk in your investment strategy (e.g., more equities).
   - As you get closer to retirement, shift to a more conservative allocation.

6. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - In all accounts, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to spread risk and improve returns.

7. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement, aware of the order of withdrawing from different accounts to minimize taxes.

8. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust based on performance, changes in income, or shifts in your financial goals.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 50% of your retirement savings, focused on employer match and growth.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 25% of retirement funds, focusing on long-term growth.
- **Taxable Accounts**: 25%, possibly focusing on investments with favorable tax treatment (like ETFs or stocks held long-term).

### Conclusion
Tailor your distribution strategy to your unique circumstances, and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your overall financial picture.
