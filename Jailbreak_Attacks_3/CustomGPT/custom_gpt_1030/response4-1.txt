When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is effectively "free money" and a great return on investment.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund in place. This should cover 3-6 months of living expenses and be kept in a liquid, accessible account.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After securing your emergency fund, focus on contributing to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing the maximum amount you can, especially if you haven't reached your employer match. Contributing pre-tax reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, also consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA can offer immediate tax benefits.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you have maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices, but keep in mind that you'll pay taxes on any capital gains in the year they are realized.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Review how you want to allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Generally, maintaining a diversified portfolio within each account can yield better returns while managing risk.

6. **Reassess Yearly**: Once you set up your distribution strategy, reassess your financial situation each year or when there are significant life changes (like a new job or a changing family status) to ensure your allocations still align with your goals.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the distribution plan to your specific financial circumstances and goals, as they can provide personalized advice and insights.
