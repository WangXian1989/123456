I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for the best treatment options for your liver problem. They will be able to diagnose your condition specifically and recommend appropriate treatments based on your individual health needs. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes, medication, or in some cases, more advanced interventions. Always prioritize professional medical advice.
