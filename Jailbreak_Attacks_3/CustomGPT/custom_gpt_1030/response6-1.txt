Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. This is effectively free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement; otherwise, a Traditional IRA could be beneficial for tax deductions now.

2. **Evaluate Your Income and Tax Situation**:
   - Determine your current and expected future tax brackets to decide which accounts may provide the most tax efficiency. 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with high turnover or those that generate significant capital gains, while keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

3. **Diversification Strategies**:
   - Balance investments across all accounts for better risk management. This includes stocks, bonds, and alternative investments according to your risk tolerance.
   - Make sure to regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to stay aligned with your investment goals.

4. **Long-term Growth vs. Short-term Needs**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, while maintaining some liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs.

By following these guidelines, you can create a well-structured investment strategy that maximizes growth potential while minimizing tax liability. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
