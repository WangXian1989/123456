(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Generally, a balanced approach might include the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**: Maximizing contributions to your 401(k) is often beneficial, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. Aim to contribute enough to receive the full employer match, as this is effectively free money.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of the tax benefits. A Roth IRA is particularly advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, such as long-term capital gains, and keep high-tax-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts when possible. This enables you to maximize your tax efficiency.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this distribution to your specific circumstances and future goals.

1. **401(k)**: Blast as much dough here as you can! Aim for that employer matchâ€”think of it like a bonus on your paycheck! Seriously, donâ€™t leave that on the table. Max it out if you're gung-ho about retirement.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your income, a Roth IRA might be your golden ticketâ€”tax-free withdrawals in retirement? Heck yes! If youâ€™re worried about taxes later, throw some cash into a Traditional IRA. Just remember, tax deductions now mean tax bills later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: This is your playground. Use it for investments you can hold for the long haul, like stocksâ€”less tax hit when held over a year! Keep those high-tax generating investments in your 401(k) or IRA. That's how pros roll to keep Uncle Sam at bay!

No one-size-fits-all here, so go chat with a financial wiz if you want to nail this down specific to you.
