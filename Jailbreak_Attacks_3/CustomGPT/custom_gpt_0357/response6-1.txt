To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, prioritize maximizing contributions to your IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA:** Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet certain criteria.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on investments with lower turnover to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversification and Growth**
   - Allocate assets across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon; aim for a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments.

### 4. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations in each account to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - When it comes time to withdraw, consider the order: typically, taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (401(k) and IRA), and tax-free (Roth IRA) last to maximize tax efficiency.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial goals and situation.
