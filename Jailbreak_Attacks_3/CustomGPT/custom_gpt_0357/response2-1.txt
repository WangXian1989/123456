Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a strategic approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds for diversification.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Consider a Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, where withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Tax Deductibility**: Evaluate if you can deduct contributions to a Traditional IRA based on income limits.
   - **Diversification**: Similar to your 401(k), focus on a mix of stocks and bonds.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for short- to medium-term goals, as they allow for easier access to funds without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider using tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Bond Investments**: These can be less tax-efficient, so consider holding them in tax-advantaged accounts instead.

### General Tips:
- **Emergency Fund**: Always maintain an emergency fund before investing heavily.
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across all accounts considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Regular Review**: Adjust your allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change.
