Dividing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue to Fund 401(k)**:
   - After maximizing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Look at the investment options and fees.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments. This can be beneficial for flexibility and when you need funds before retirement.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts tailored to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals from your accounts, especially with traditional IRAs and 401(k)s, which are taxed as ordinary income.

7. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your allocations and contribution levels annually to adapt to any changes in your financial situation or goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your circumstances.
