Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Prioritize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you can, contribute to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) match. This can provide tax benefits depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Build a Taxable Account:**
   - Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (the annual limits can vary), consider diverting extra funds into a taxable account. This gives you more flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** You'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. Planning your tax bracket at withdrawal time is essential.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free if conditions are met. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Capital gains tax applies to profits from investments. Consider holding investments long-term to minimize taxes.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Younger individuals might focus more on growth in their 401(k) and IRA, while older investors may want to shift to more conservative investments, maintaining a balanced risk in taxable accounts.

### Conclusion:
Evaluate your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy suited to your personal circumstances.
