The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contribution, continue making contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This can reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for goals that are shorter-term or for flexibility, as these funds can be accessed without penalties before retirement age.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Tax-efficient investing is crucial. Placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts can minimize your tax burden.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your strategy regularly and adjust based on changes in income, financial goals, or market conditions.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your unique situation.
