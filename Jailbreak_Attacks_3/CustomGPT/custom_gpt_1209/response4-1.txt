It’s important to consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon when distributing your money among different investment accounts. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Max out your contribution if possible for tax-deferred growth.
2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions, depending on your income level.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that you might need to access before retirement or for tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains.

Evaluate your specific situation, potentially consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
