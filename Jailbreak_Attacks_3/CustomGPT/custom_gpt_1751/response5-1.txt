Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize employer match**: Contribute enough to get the full match if available.
   - **Tax benefits**: Contributions are made before tax, which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax treatment**: Contribute to a traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now; choose a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits and income restrictions for Roth IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement or for short-term goals.
   - **Tax considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; focus on tax-efficient investments.

### Strategy:
1. **Prioritize contributions**: Start with your 401(k) up to the match, then max out an IRA, and finally contribute to taxable accounts.
2. **Diversify investments**: Consider a mix of asset types based on risk tolerance and investment time horizon.
3. **Regular review**: Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
