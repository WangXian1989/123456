I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest common treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Medication:**
   - Antivirals for viral hepatitis.
   - Medications to manage symptoms or complications.

2. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Avoiding alcohol and certain medications.
   - Adopting a balanced diet with limited fats and sugars.
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies to track liver health.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be an option.

Always follow up with a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
