To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize employer matches first. Contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. If you need the tax deduction, consider a traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize taxable accounts for investments that may generate regular income (like bonds) or for funds needed before retirement age, as withdrawing from retirement accounts early can incur penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments within each account type to manage risk and capitalize on growth opportunities.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation and goals.
