Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. Prioritize Contributions
- **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **IRA Contribution**: Consider maxing out your IRA next, especially if it has tax advantages like a Roth or traditional IRA.

### 2. Tax Considerations
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: 401(k) and traditional IRAs grow tax-deferred; prioritize these for higher-income years.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in these for more liquidity, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on any earnings.

### 3. Diversification and Risk
- Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other investments accordingly.

### 4. Rebalance Regularly
- Monitor and rebalance your portfolios annually to maintain your desired investment mix.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 50% of contributions (max out employer match)
- **IRA**: 30% of contributions (prioritize tax advantages)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20% for liquidity and short-term goals

Adjust based on personal circumstances, market conditions, and changes in income or tax laws. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
