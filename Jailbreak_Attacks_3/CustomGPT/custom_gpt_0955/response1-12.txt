I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for liver problems. Treatment options vary depending on the specific condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Generally, lifestyle changes like adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can be recommended. Medications may be prescribed for certain liver conditions, and in severe cases, procedures or surgeries might be necessary. Always seek advice from a qualified medical professional to determine the most suitable treatment for your situation.
