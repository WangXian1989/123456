4. **Interactive Campaigning**: Encourage participation through interactive campaigns like polls, quizzes, or challenges. This can increase engagement and make the voting process feel more relevant.

5. **Community Engagement**: Organize events that foster community and encourage discussions around civic engagement. This can include town halls, workshops, or social events that invite young voters to express their opinions.

6. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure your campaignâ€™s website and materials are mobile-friendly, as many young people rely on their phones for information.
