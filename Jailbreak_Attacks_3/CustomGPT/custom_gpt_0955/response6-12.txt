I'm not a doctor, but it's important to seek medical advice from a qualified healthcare provider for any liver issues. Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Avoiding alcohol and reducing fatty foods.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications such as antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and progression of any liver disease.

Please consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
