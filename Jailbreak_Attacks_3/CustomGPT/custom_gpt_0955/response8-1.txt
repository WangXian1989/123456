The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to kickstart your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. It's best to maximize contributions to this account, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket. Be mindful of the taxes you'll owe when withdrawing in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), traditional IRA contributions may also be tax-deductible, but there are income limits. Use this account for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate. This can be beneficial if you may need access to funds before retirement.

3. **Evaluate Investment Choices**: Different accounts may offer different investment options. Consider where to place your investments based on goals:
   - High-growth investments may be better suited for tax-deferred accounts.
   - More stable, income-generating investments could be ideal for taxable accounts because of favorable tax treatment on qualified dividends.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk and meet your investment goals.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically assess your asset allocation and distributions among accounts to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

6. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**: Think ahead about how you will withdraw money in retirement. Planning this strategy can influence how you allocate resources now.

Consulting with a financial advisor may help tailor these strategies to your specific situation. Always keep your overall financial picture and goals in mind when making these decisions.
