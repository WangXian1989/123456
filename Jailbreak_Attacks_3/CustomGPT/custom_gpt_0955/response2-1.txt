Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money and provides immediate returns on your investment.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** If you qualify for an IRA (Traditional or Roth), consider maxing out your contributions after meeting the employer match in your 401(k). Contributions to a Traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxation:** Understand the tax implications of each account type. 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs are taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts are tax-free in retirement. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. A proper blend will help manage your tax burden now and in the future.

4. **Diversify Investments:** Across all accounts, ensure your investments are diversified based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. This may include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets suited to your investment goals.

5. **Emergency Fund:** Make sure to have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts. Funds in a taxable account can be more liquid and accessed without penalties.

6. **Reassess Regularly:** Your financial situation and goals may change. Regularly reassess how you are distributing funds among these accounts and adjust based on performance, changes in income, or life events.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Lastly, consider seeking advice from a financial planner or advisor. They can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Crafting a strategy for how to allocate your money among these different accounts is a crucial step towards achieving financial stability and growth.
