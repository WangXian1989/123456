To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, ensure you contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money." The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50). Choose based on whether you prefer tax-deferred growth (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth) in retirement.
  
2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts are tax-advantaged. Contributions may reduce your taxable income (Traditional) or grow tax-free (Roth). Plan your withdrawals to minimize taxes in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and short-term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income. Aim to hold investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Generally, place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts for potential higher growth, while using taxable accounts for more stable investments (like bonds).

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on market performance and your retirement timeline to ensure you stay aligned with your investment goals.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside these accounts before heavily investing to cover unexpected expenses.

6. **Professional Guidance**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation.

Diversifying your investments and maximizing tax advantages can lead to a more robust portfolio for retirement.
