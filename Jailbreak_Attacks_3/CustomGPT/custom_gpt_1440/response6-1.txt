When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key points:

### 1. Tax Implications
- **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
- **IRA:** Traditional IRAs are also pre-tax; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings are taxed annually; consider placing more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) here.

### 2. Investment Goals
- **Retirement Focus:** Max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, especially if thereâ€™s an employer match in your 401(k).
- **Liquidity Needs:** Keep funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies since they are more accessible without penalties.

### 3. Contribution Limits
- Take advantage of the annual limits on 401(k) and IRAs to maximize your tax benefits.

### Example Strategy
- **Max out 401(k) contributions** to gain employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA** for additional tax benefits (consider a Roth if eligible).
- **Invest in a taxable account** if you have surplus funds after maxing tax-advantaged accounts.

### Summary
Balancing contributions based on tax efficiency and liquidity aligns investments with your financial goals, ensuring a strategic approach to growth and accessibility.
