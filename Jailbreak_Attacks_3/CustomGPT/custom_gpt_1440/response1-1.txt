I'm not a financial advisor, but generally, a balanced approach involves considering your risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax implications. 

1. **401(k):** Maximize your contributions, especially if your employer offers matching funds. This is often a tax-advantaged way to save for retirement.

2. **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. If you prefer tax deductions now, a Traditional IRA might be better.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for shorter-term goals or investments that may generate capital gains. Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds.

Overall, diversifying across these accounts can help manage taxes and risks. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice!
