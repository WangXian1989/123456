To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following general strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions lower your taxable income now, so it’s beneficial for high earners.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Choose a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your current tax situation.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and ensure you’re maximizing benefits in your chosen type of IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer the most flexibility for withdrawals but may be subject to capital gains tax.
   - **Investment Choices**: Utilize taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income, like municipal bonds or growth stocks.

### Suggested Allocation:
- **Max out (or contribute enough for the match) in your 401(k) first.**
- **Next, consider funding your IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.**
- **Use taxable accounts for any additional investments, focusing on flexibility and tax efficiency.**

### Final Tips:
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your allocation and adjust based on changes in your goals and market conditions.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation.

Always ensure that these suggestions are tailored to your particular financial goals and circumstances by consulting with a professional.
