Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Traditional pre-tax contributions reduce taxable income now but are taxable upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax advantages, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement if contributions are made post-tax.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible but subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have liquidity in a savings account before heavily investing.

4. **Investment Timeline**: 
   - For long-term goals (retirement), focus on tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA).
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals since you can access these funds without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Check your asset allocation periodically to ensure you're on track with your goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
