Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is effectively free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax bracket.

2. **Consider Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus more on tax-advantaged accounts. They grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Near-Term Needs**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for easier access to funds.

3. **Balance Risk**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance. Younger investors may prefer more stocks, while those closer to retirement might lean towards bonds.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Consider placing tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Rebalance Annually**:
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and make adjustments based on performance, contributions, and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting a financial advisor is advisable to tailor this approach to your specific circumstances.
