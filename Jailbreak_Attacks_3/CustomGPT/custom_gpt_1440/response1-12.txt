I'm not a doctor, but itâ€™s important to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications to address specific conditions, and regular monitoring. Depending on the severity, more advanced treatments like liver transplant could be necessary. Always talk to your doctor for personalized advice!
