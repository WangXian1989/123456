Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to employer-sponsored plans like a 401(k) first, especially if they offer matching contributions. After that, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, as these provide tax advantages. Lastly, allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
