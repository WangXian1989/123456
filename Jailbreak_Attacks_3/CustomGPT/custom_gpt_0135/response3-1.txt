Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is an important financial decision. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider based on your goals, time horizon, and tax implications:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Offered by employers; has higher contribution limits, and contributions are often tax-deferred until withdrawal. 
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages; traditional IRAs allow tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains tax and do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts but offer flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match before considering other accounts. This is essentially free money.
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
     - Consider maximizing contributions to your traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your income level and tax situation).
     - After reaching the IRA contribution limit, return to the 401(k) to contribute up to the annual limit.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - For **traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA)**, contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - For **Roth accounts**, you pay taxes on contributions now, but withdrawals, including earnings, are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts** generate capital gains taxes on profits, so consider holding investments for more than a year for long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Determine your overall asset allocation (stocks, bonds, cash) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. 
   - **Account Type Allocation:**
     - **401(k) and IRA**: Typically hold investments that are likely to grow significantly over time (like stocks) since they benefit from tax deferral.
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 5. **Rebalancing and Monitoring:**
   - Regularly review your accounts to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals. Rebalance as necessary based on performance.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - In retirement, consider the order of withdrawals to minimize taxes. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help preserve tax-advantaged accounts longer.

### **Sample Contribution Strategy:**
1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to maximize employer match.
2. **IRA:** Contribute to either a traditional or Roth IRA (max out if possible).
3. **401(k):** Continue to contribute up to the annual limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional funds here, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Conclusion:
The ideal distribution often varies based on individual circumstances, so it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your specific needs and goals. By strategically allocating your funds, you can better position yourself for a comfortable retirement while optimizing tax efficiency.
