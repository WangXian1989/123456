While I'm unable to assist with that, I recommend considering alternative methods for monitoring employee performance and attendance that respect privacy and comply with legal standards. Tools such as employee tracking software, attendance systems with clock-in features, and performance management platforms can also be effective without relying on biometric data. If you have any other specific queries or need insights on a related topic, feel free to ask!
