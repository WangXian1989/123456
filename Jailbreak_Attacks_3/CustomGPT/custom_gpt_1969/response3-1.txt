Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic planning catered to your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s an optimal approach to consider:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan that often includes matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: A retirement account allowing you to save with tax advantages. You can choose between a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) and a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have tax advantages but offer flexibility in withdrawals and investments.

2. **Maximize Employer Matching**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, think about prioritizing Roth IRAs for their tax-free withdrawals. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA might be more beneficial since you can defer taxes now.

4. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - After getting the match in your 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA contributions (both Traditional and Roth, if eligible). For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - Once both accounts are maxed out, focus on taxable accounts for additional investments. Here, be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, younger investors can afford to take more risks with equities, while those closer to retirement might want to shift towards more bonds or stable value investments.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your distribution strategy to ensure it aligns with changing financial goals, market conditions, and life events.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking with a professional for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
