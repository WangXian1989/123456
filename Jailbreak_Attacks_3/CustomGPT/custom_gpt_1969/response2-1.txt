Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. The 401(k) has higher contribution limits than IRAs.
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, and consider a diversified portfolio within the options available in your 401(k).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial, as withdrawals are tax-free. Conversely, a traditional IRA may be better if you expect lower taxes in retirement since contributions can reduce your taxable income now.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Remember that IRAs have lower contribution limits compared to 401(k)s, so make sure to fully understand the annual limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility in accessing your money without penalties before retirement age. They can also be beneficial for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax implications. Be mindful of capital gains taxes if you plan to sell investments for a profit.

4. **Balanced Approach**:
   - A balanced approach often entails funding your 401(k) and maxing out your IRA contributions first, then using taxable accounts for additional savings or investment.
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Regular Review**: 
   - Regularly review your allocations based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals or situation.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your unique situation and objectives.
