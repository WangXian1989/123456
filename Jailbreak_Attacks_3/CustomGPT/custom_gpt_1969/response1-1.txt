Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general principles to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before focusing on other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions depending on your income.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Efficient Investments**: Taxable accounts are where you'll be paying capital gains tax on any profits. Investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains can be more tax-efficient. Consider keeping bonds and high-turnover investments in tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) or IRA.

4. **Diversify Across Accounts**: It can be beneficial to have a mix of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts to manage your tax situation in retirement. This allows you flexibility in withdrawing funds in a tax-efficient manner.

5. **Review Your Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your investment goals. You might have a different allocation strategy in your retirement accounts compared to taxable accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Since each person's financial situation is unique, it may be wise to consult a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances.

This general strategy would help in achieving a balanced approach to investing and tax management over time.
