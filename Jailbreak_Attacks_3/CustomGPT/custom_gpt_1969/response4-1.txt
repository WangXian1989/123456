To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth like a 401(k). Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No special tax advantages, but they offer more flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50) for 2023.
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) for 2023.

4. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts. If you think your tax rate will be lower in retirement, prioritize traditional tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment choices within each account are diversified. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired level of risk and investment strategy.

7. **Professional Advice**: If needed, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your unique financial situation.

Always be sure to align these strategies with your long-term financial goals and individual circumstances.
