(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and tax implications. Generally, itâ€™s wise to prioritize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money. Following that, maxing out your IRA contributions can also be beneficial for tax advantages. Finally, if you have additional funds, consider investing in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility. It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.

Seriously, if your 401(k) comes with a match, youâ€™d be silly not to grab that cash like itâ€™s the last slice of pizza at a party. Next up, hit your IRA â€“ whether itâ€™s a traditional or Roth, itâ€™s a great way to stash away some cash with tax benefits. Once youâ€™ve squeezed every last drop out of those options, then throw some money into your taxable account. It gives you flexibility and easy access, but remember â€“ taxes on gains, yikes! So, gather your financial intel, maybe get a pro to help you navigate the waters, but donâ€™t leave free money on the table!
