To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Determine Contribution Limits**: First, understand the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

2. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, which defer or reduce taxes on your investments. A Roth IRA can also be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon when allocating assets across your accounts. You might want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts, where capital gains distributions may be taxed.

5. **Investment Selection**: Select your investments based on their tax efficiency. For instance, bonds and high-dividend stocks can generate taxable income, making them potentially better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your account allocations and adjust them as your financial situation, market conditions, or tax laws change.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor who can help tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.

This approach helps ensure that you maximize your investment growth while potentially minimizing your tax burden.
