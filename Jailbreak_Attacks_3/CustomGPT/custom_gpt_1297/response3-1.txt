Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer match, tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditionals offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth after retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax; however, they offer flexibility and access to your money without penalties.

2. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts for long-term growth.
   - Consider Roth IRAs if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Establish an Overall Investment Strategy**:
   - Define your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals to determine asset allocation.
   - A diversified portfolio across stocks, bonds, and other assets can minimize risk.

5. **Implement the 80/20 Rule**: 
   - Allocate a significant portion (80%) to tax-advantaged accounts, and consider keeping (20%) in taxable accounts for liquidity.

6. **Regularly Rebalance**:
   - Review your investment distribution annually or semi-annually to adjust based on market performance and your changing financial situation.

7. **Avoid Early Withdrawals**:
   - Retain funds in retirement accounts to avoid penalties and maximize compounding.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Professional guidance can help tailor the best distribution strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced approach to effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
