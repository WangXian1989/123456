Î± The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts provide tax benefits. The contribution limits vary, so ensure youâ€™re aware of them for each account type.

2. **Consider Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money for your retirement.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: Funds in a 401(k) and traditional IRA grow tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts, on the other hand, may incur capital gains taxes. Depending on your tax bracket now versus in retirement, you might want to spread your investments accordingly.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are well-diversified across different asset classes to manage risk. Consider your age, risk tolerance, and investment goals to guide your asset allocation.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Over time, your asset allocation may drift due to market performance. Regularly rebalancing your portfolio helps maintain your desired risk level.

Itâ€™s recommended to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
