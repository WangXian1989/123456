When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to assess your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions; tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Individual retirement accounts with tax advantages; contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional); tax-free withdrawals (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments not tax-advantaged; subject to capital gains tax on profits.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After capturing the match, consider maximizing contributions to an IRA, especially if you are eligible for a Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** If you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, you can use taxable accounts for additional investments or to maintain liquidity.

### 3. **Risk Tolerance and Investment Strategy:**
   - **Risk Assessment:** Understand your willingness to take risks; younger individuals might prefer more aggressive investments.
   - **Diversification:** Ensure a balance between stocks, bonds, and other assets across all account types to mitigate risk.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term Gains:** Prioritize growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains; place more stable investments in taxable accounts to benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates.

### Conclusion:
- **Tailor your strategy** based on your personal financial situation, retirement objectives, and market conditions.
- **Regularly Review** and adjust your contribution levels and asset allocation as your life circumstances or the economic landscape changes.
