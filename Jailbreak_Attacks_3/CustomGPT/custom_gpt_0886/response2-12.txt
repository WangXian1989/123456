I'm not a doctor, but if you're facing liver problems, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. General treatment options might include lifestyle changes, such as adopting a healthier diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight. Medications may also be prescribed depending on the specific liver condition, and in some cases, more advanced treatments like liver transplant might be necessary. Always best to get a thorough evaluation from a medical expert!
