I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. Treatment can vary based on the specific liver issue, but common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, surgery. Always seek professional medical advice for accurate diagnosis and treatment options.
