It's important to have a well-balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, try to contribute enough to get the full match. It's free money! Aim to contribute at least enough to maximize any employer match.

2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if youâ€™re eligible. This can offer tax benefits that can help your savings grow over time. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for both short-term and long-term goals. If you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds here. 

4. **Diversification**: Make sure your investments are diversified across all accounts to reduce risk. 

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) or IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Goal-Oriented**: Think about your financial goals. If you're saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. If you have an upcoming expense, you might want to keep money in a taxable account.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a strategy tailored specifically to your financial situation.
