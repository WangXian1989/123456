The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match; it’s free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if feasible.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. 

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds you might need in the short term or for investments that generate capital gains, as long-term capital gains are usually taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - If you’re saving for retirement, prioritize contributions to 401(k) and IRA accounts. For short-term goals (like buying a house), consider keeping funds in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts align with your overall risk tolerance and diversification strategy.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review your allocations and adjust as necessary to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
