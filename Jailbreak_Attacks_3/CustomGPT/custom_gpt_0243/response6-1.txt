It's great you are thinking about how to manage your investments! Here's a simple approach to distributing your money effectively:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. Aim to max it out if possible.
   - **IRA**: After the 401(k), contribute to your IRA. You can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals).

2. **Allocate remaining funds**:
   - Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

3. **Investment allocation strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate).
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon when making specific investment choices.

4. **Rebalance periodically**: 
   - Make sure to review and adjust your allocations as needed to stay aligned with your financial goals.

This strategy allows you to benefit from tax advantages while maintaining liquidity and flexibility in your investments! If you have more specific numbers or goals, I can help further refine this strategy.
