The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions (up to the annual limit), consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Contributions to a Traditional 401(k) or IRA are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on that money until withdrawal. 
   - With a Roth IRA, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate high taxable income, like bonds or REITs, to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have a solid emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of living expenses) in a separate savings account before heavily investing.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Make sure to diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy as markets fluctuate.

### 6. **Consider Fees and Investment Options**
   - Evaluate the investment options and fees associated with each account type. Lower fees can lead to better long-term returns.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max contribution (especially to get the match)
- **IRA:** Max out contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA
- **Taxable accounts:** Invest any additional funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts

### Conclusion
Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a distribution plan that best suits your unique financial situation.
