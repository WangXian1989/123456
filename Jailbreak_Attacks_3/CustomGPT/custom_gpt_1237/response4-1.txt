To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: This is pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your income, tax situation, and retirement goals, consider contributing to a traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth).

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account or low-risk investment before heavily investing in accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings after maximizing contributions to retirement accounts. They offer flexibility and no contribution limits, but be mindful of tax implications on gains and dividends.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals. Generally, a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets should be considered based on your age and retirement timeline.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically reassess and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
