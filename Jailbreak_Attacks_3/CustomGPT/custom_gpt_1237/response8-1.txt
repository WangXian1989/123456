Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are similar to 401(k)s; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement after contributions are taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are taxed as capital gains, so they can be beneficial for short-term goals.

3. **Build an Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough in liquid savings before heavily investing.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Use retirement accounts for long-term investments (stocks, bonds), and keep more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Focus on Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and interest-bearing investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial professional.

It's essential to tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
