Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if you’re in a high tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income. Good if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - These are flexible and can be used for short-term goals or emergencies. 
   - Consider holding investments with lower tax implications, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains tax.

### General Strategies:
- **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Align your portfolio with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and shifts in your financial goals.

### Suggested Allocation:
- Maximize employer match in 401(k).
- Contribute to an IRA (traditional for tax benefits or Roth for tax-free growth).
- Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investing.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.
