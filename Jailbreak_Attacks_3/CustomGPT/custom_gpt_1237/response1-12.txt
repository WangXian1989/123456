I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about common liver treatment options. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes maintaining a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and exercising regularly.

2. **Medication**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), your doctor may prescribe antiviral drugs or medications to manage symptoms.

3. **Dietary Adjustments**: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats can support liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests can help track liver function.

5. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from vitamin E or other antioxidants, but always consult your doctor before taking supplements.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical procedures or even a liver transplant may be necessary.

Make sure to discuss your specific situation with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your liver health.
