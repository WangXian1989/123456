Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider funding a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. The choice between them depends on whether you prefer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Return to 401(k)**: Once you’ve maxed out your IRA contributions (up to the annual limit), go back to your 401(k) and increase your contributions up to the annual limit. 

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA but want to save more, consider putting money in taxable accounts. These offers more flexibility and easier access to funds without the penalties associated with retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Make sure you're investing in a diversified mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts, tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA), while holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize your overall tax burden.

7. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also a good idea to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
