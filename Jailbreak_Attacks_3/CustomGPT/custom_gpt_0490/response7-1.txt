Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - After securing your employer match, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA (both traditional and Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). These accounts often provide tax benefits that can compound your savings over time.
   - The 401(k) contribution limit is generally higher than that of an IRA, so aim to contribute up to the limit if you can.

3. **Diversification of Tax Treatments**:
   - Utilize a mix of traditional accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA) and Roth accounts (like Roth IRA) to diversify your tax exposure during retirement. Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
   - Once you've maxed your tax-advantaged accounts, consider utilizing a taxable investment account. This offers more flexibility for withdrawals, but be mindful of the tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Across all these accounts, ensure you have a diversified investment strategy in terms of asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation and adjust for any changes in your financial situation or goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best distribution strategy for your situation, speaking with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your circumstances.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize your retirement savings and investment growth.
