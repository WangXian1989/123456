I'm not a doctor, but generally, liver treatment options depend on the specific condition. Common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Avoid alcohol, maintain a healthy weight, and eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the issue, medications can help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups can help track liver function and detect issues early.

4. **Potential Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
