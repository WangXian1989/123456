To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is effectively free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally good for high-income earners due to tax-deferred growth. Consider using it for bonds or other income-generating investments.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Use a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, suitable for high-income years. A Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it ideal for lower-income years or if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize tax impact.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes—stocks, bonds, and alternative investments—adjusted to your risk tolerance.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Consider Withdrawals and Timing**: Plan for when you will need to access your funds, as this can impact which accounts to draw from first, especially during retirement.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 60% of total retirement savings
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 30% of total retirement savings
- **Taxable Accounts**: 10% of total investments

### Final Thoughts:
Your distribution should align with your retirement goals, investment horizon, and taxation expectations. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized planning based on your specific situation is also advisable.
