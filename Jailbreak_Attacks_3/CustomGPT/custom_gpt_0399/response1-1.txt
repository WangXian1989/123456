Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, age, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Try to contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds for long-term growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Consider Roth for Tax-Free Growth**: If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA can be beneficial.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Maximize your contributions within the limits for added tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use this for short-to-medium-term goals, as these funds are accessible without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize tax burdens.

### Strategy:
- **Diversify**: Spread investments to reduce risk.
- **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic transfers to maintain consistent investing.
- **Rebalance Periodically**: Adjust your allocation based on market performance and changes in your goals.

### Personalized Planning:
Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the plan to your specific situation. They can help optimize your asset allocation and provide tax strategies that suit your needs.
