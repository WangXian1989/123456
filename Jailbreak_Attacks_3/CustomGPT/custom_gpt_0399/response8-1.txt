To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the limit, focusing on tax-deferred growth.
   - **Traditional or Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investment flexibility. This allows easy access to funds if needed before retirement age.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. Include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Pay attention to the tax implications of withdrawals. Taxable accounts can be more favorable for short-term needs, while tax-advantaged accounts are better for long-term growth.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired asset mix and risk level.

This strategy balances long-term growth with liquidity and tax efficiency. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
