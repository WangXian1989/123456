To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you’re not near retirement, contribute to your 401(k) to reduce your taxable income. Consider a mix of traditional and Roth options if available.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA (Roth or traditional based on your eligibility). This offers tax advantages and compound growth.

3. **Assess Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Investments here might have different tax implications, so choose tax-efficient funds.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified. This can help manage risk and optimize returns.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications; for instance, you might want to draw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations periodically based on market conditions, changes in your financial goals, and approaching retirement.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
