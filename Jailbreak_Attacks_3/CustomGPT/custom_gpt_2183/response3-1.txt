When determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**: Identify your short-term and long-term financial objectives. This includes retirement planning, buying a home, funding education, or other investments.

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching. Contributions are tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Allows for tax-advantaged savings for retirement with annual contribution limits. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Self-managed investment accounts with no tax advantages. You pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

3. **Evaluate Your Current Tax Situation**: Consider whether you are in a higher or lower tax bracket now compared to what you anticipate in retirement. This will influence whether to prioritize tax-deferred (401(k) and traditional IRA) or tax-free (Roth IRA) contributions.

4. **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), ensure you contribute at least enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

5. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (plus $7,500 catch-up contribution if over age 50)
   - IRA: $6,500 (plus $1,000 catch-up contribution if over age 50). 

6. **Diversify Contributions**: Generally, consider a mix of account types based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. A common strategy is:
   - Prioritize 401(k) contributions until you get the employer match.
   - Next, consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax advantages.
   - Finally, use taxable accounts for extra savings or investment opportunities once you hit the contribution limits for retirement accounts.

7. **Asset Allocation**: Decide how to allocate your investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account based on your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and market outlook. Stocks may offer growth, while bonds can provide stability.

8. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your investments as needed to ensure your portfolio aligns with your goals and risk profile.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If youâ€™re unsure or have complex financial situations, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

Implementing these steps will help you effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts while aligning with your financial goals.
