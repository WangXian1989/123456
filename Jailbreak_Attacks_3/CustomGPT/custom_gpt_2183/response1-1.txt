When considering how to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some key factors to think about for a strategic approach:

1. **Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers a company match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it, as this is essentially “free” money.

2. **Tax Considerations:** 
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income. However, you'll owe taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are funded with after-tax dollars and any capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they are earned. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals but generally lack the tax advantages of retirement accounts.

3. **Investment Goals:** 
   - For long-term growth, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)s and IRAs) since they have higher growth potential without immediate tax implications.
   - If you have shorter-term goals or need liquidity, prioritize taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure your portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors regardless of the account type.

5. **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

6. **Withdrawal Needs:** Consider when you might need access to your money. Taxable accounts offer easier access without penalties, while retirement accounts usually have restrictions until certain age thresholds are met.

In summary, a balanced strategy might be to contribute sufficient amounts to get any employer match in your 401(k), contribute to an IRA (Roth or traditional based on your tax situation), and then allocate any remaining funds to a taxable account for added flexibility and investment opportunities. It's often helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific financial situation and goals.
