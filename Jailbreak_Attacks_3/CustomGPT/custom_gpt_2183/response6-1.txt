Distributing your money effectively amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like your retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines to help you allocate your funds:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match as it is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if your budget allows.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
  
### 2. **Consider Asset Location**
   - **High-Growth Assets in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place investments that you expect to grow substantially (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA to defer taxes on capital gains.
   - **Income-Generating Assets in Taxable Accounts**: Keep lower-growth assets or those that generate dividends (like bonds or REITs) in taxable accounts to manage tax liability effectively.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Current vs. Future Tax Rates**: Think about whether you expect to be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement. This can affect whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA.
   - **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan how and when you'll withdraw funds, considering the tax implications to minimize liabilities over time.

### 4. **Set Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if youâ€™re age 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those aged 50 and older).

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - **Rebalance Periodically**: Adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.
   - **Stay Informed**: Keep up to date with tax laws and retirement account regulations to ensure your strategies remain effective.

By keeping these strategies in mind, you will be positioned to optimize your retirement contributions while managing your overall tax exposure effectively.
