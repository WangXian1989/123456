Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages of Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar to a 401(k) with tax-deferred growth. Contributions may be tax-deductible, depending on your income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These do not offer tax advantages, but they provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Taxes are owed on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

3. **Investment Horizon:** If you're far from retirement, you might lean toward more aggressive investments in your taxable account, while keeping more conservative investments in your retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Consider your future withdrawal strategy. For example, you might want to avoid withdrawing from your tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) until required minimum distributions (RMDs) kick in at age 72 to enhance tax efficiency.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to develop a tailored investment strategy that meets your personal financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, which can help optimize your savings for retirement and other financial goals.
