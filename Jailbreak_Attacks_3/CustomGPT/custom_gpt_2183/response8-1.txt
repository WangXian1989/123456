To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to meet any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if possible, as it reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. A Traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth.
   
2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that are less tax-efficient (e.g., bonds, high-turnover funds) to minimize the impact of taxes. Favor long-term capital gains and qualified dividends to reduce taxes on earnings.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified to manage risk effectively. This means owning a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) that align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodic rebalancing helps you maintain your desired asset allocation. This may involve selling investments in your taxable account while buying into your retirement accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, plan your withdrawal strategy based on tax implications. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and then tax-free accounts when necessary.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking professional advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals. They can offer personalized strategies for optimal asset allocation.

By following these principles, you can create a distribution strategy that maximizes growth while minimizing taxes over time.
