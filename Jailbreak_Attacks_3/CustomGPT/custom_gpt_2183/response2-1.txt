The optimal way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general guide to help you decide:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Consider maximizing contributions up to the annual limit if it's aligned with your retirement goals.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Tax Diversification**: Consider both Traditional and Roth IRAs. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for IRAs and explore backdoor Roth opportunities if your income exceeds limits for direct contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer flexibility and access to funds without penalties. This is useful for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Investment Choices**: You can invest in a wide range of assets, but be mindful of tax implications, such as capital gains taxes on your portfolio.

### Strategy Tips:
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Higher-risk investments can be more favorable in tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Tax Considerations**: Place investments that generate high ordinary income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts, while placing tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
- **Regular Reviews**: Reassess your allocations periodically based on market performance, life changes, and shifts in your financial situation.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach often involves maximizing benefits in your 401(k) and IRAs first, followed by taxable accounts for flexibility and additional investment opportunities. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
