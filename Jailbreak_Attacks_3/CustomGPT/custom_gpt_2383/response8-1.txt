The best approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Generally, it's wise to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, as these accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term investment growth.

2. **Prioritize Contribution Limits**: Each account type has its contribution limits. As of 2023, for example, you can contribute up to $22,500 to your 401(k) (or $30,000 for those aged 50 and over) and up to $6,500 to an IRA (or $7,500 for those aged 50 and over). Ensure you are aware of and optimize these limits.

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**: 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income in the year you make them if itâ€™s a traditional account. IRAs can also provide tax deductions depending on income limits. If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a Roth IRA may be a more favorable option for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation Across Accounts**: Consider holding more aggressive growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservatively to avoid tax burdens in taxable accounts. Taxable accounts may be better suited for assets that generate capital gains or dividends that are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Optimize Withdrawals**: Plan how you will draw down these accounts in retirement to manage your tax liabilities effectively. Taking funds first from taxable accounts can help minimize tax implications on withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your distribution strategy, especially as financial goals change, contributions increase, or tax laws fluctuate.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For more tailored advice based on your unique situation, it can be beneficial to engage with a financial advisor who understands your financial landscape.

Keep in mind that personal financial decisions are complex, and it may be advantageous to create a customized strategy that aligns with your overall financial objectives.
