(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The optimal distribution of your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. A general strategy is to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you're eligible, as these accounts can provide significant tax advantages either through pre-tax contributions (traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth IRA). Finally, any additional investments can be directed towards taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices, but be mindful of capital gains taxes. 

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, so you want to know how to juggle your cash flow between your 401(k), IRA, and good ol' taxable accounts? First off, if your company offers a 401(k) match, maximize that bad boy! That's free money just waiting to pad your retirement. Next, if you can swing it, shove the max allowed into your IRAâ€”especially if it's a Roth. That means tax-free dough when you cash out! After you've ticked those boxes, anything leftover can go into your taxable accounts. Sure, they can hit you with capital gains taxes if you sell, but they give you the freedom to dip into those funds whenever you want without the restrictions of retirement accounts. Just balance your aggressive vs. conservative investments based on your risk tolerance. And hey, keep it dynamicâ€”don't be afraid to reevaluate your allocations as your financial circumstances change!
