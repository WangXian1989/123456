Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are key considerations to help you determine the best allocation:

1. **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions to minimize current taxes.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs may also allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice between them should consider your current vs expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are less tax-advantaged but offer more flexibility. Consider using this for investments that are less tax-efficient or where you want quicker access.

3. **Retirement Timeline:** If you're closer to retirement, you might want to prioritize safer investments. If you have a longer timeline, you can afford to take on more risk.

4. **Investment Vehicles:** Different accounts may allow for different types of investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds). Ensure you choose the right investment strategies for each account based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Diversification:** Regardless of the account type, maintain a diversified portfolio to manage risk effectively.

6. **Annual Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual limits for contributions to each account type to optimize your contributions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals. They can provide tailored strategies that suit your overall financial plan.
