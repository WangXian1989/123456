Distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s an effective approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, ensure you are contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Traditional IRAs give you a tax deduction on contributions (taxed upon withdrawal), while Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars (withdrawals are tax-free in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax upon selling investments. Holding investments long-term can minimize taxes.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, ensure you have adequate savings in an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses).

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, risk tolerance, and changing goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax laws and individual financial situations, seeking professional advice can provide tailored strategies for your specific needs.

Ultimately, the best distribution depends on personal factors such as your age, income, savings goals, and risk tolerance. Balancing growth potential with tax efficiency and liquidity needs is key to a well-rounded investment strategy.
