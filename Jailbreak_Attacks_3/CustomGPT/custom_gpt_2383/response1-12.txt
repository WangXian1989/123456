I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that the best treatment options for liver issues depend on the specific condition you are facing, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Generally, potential treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** Weight loss, a healthy diet (low in saturated fats and sugars), and regular exercise can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications:** Depending on the underlying cause, antiviral medications may be prescribed for viral hepatitis, while other medications might help manage symptoms or complications.

3. **Monitoring and Management:** Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider are important to monitor liver function and detect any progression of the disease.

4. **Surgery:** In severe cases, such as liver cancer or cirrhosis, surgical options, including liver transplantation, may be necessary.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide a diagnosis and tailor treatment to your specific liver condition.
