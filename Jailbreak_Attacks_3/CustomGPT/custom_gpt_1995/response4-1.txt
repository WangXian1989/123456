Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount, especially if you have a match. Consider the investment options and fees.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement and can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later on.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Utilize traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) to defer taxes until retirement. This could be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket then.
   - Use a Roth account for tax-free growth, which helps if you anticipate higher income during retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that you might need to access before retirement or for flexibility. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify within each account based on your risk tolerance. Generally, you can take more risks with long-term accounts like a 401(k) or IRA as they have time to recover from market fluctuations.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to each account to ensure consistency and take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
