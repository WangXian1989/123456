To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Understand Each Account's Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax advantages and possibly employer matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Provides tax-deferred growth (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible access to funds, but capital gains may be taxed.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
   - If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 3. **Consider Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-term goals**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-term goals**: More funds in taxable accounts for easier access.

### 4. **Balance Tax Implications**:
   - Hold investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that produce qualifying dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Monitor your allocations and adjust based on changing goals, market conditions, or tax laws.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- Max out your 401(k) contributions up to the match.
- Contribute to an IRA (prioritize Roth if eligible).
- Any remaining funds can go into taxable accounts, balancing risk and liquidity.

This approach helps to leverage the benefits of each account type while aligning with your financial goals.
