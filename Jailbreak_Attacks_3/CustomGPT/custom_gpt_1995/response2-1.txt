The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute at least enough to get any employer match. Consider maxing out contributions if feasible.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions reduce taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Capital gains are taxed when investments are sold, and dividends are taxed as income.

### 3. **Determine Your Investment Strategy:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** If you’re more risk-averse, consider bonds and stable investments in taxable accounts. Higher-risk investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - **Investment Horizon:** Longer-term investments can benefit more from tax-free growth in retirement accounts.

### 4. **Diversify Asset Allocation:**
   - Allocate different assets based on account type. Stocks may be better in tax-advantaged accounts; bonds might fit well in taxable accounts for better tax efficiency.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing:**
   - Reassess your allocation regularly based on changing goals, market conditions, and life events (e.g., retirement age).

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your income (max allowed)
- **IRA:** Contribute fully if eligible (e.g., $6,500/year if under 50)
- **Taxable Account:** Any additional savings or amounts exceeding tax-advantaged limits

### Final Tips:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have enough liquid savings for emergencies before heavily investing.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A professional can provide personalized advice based on your situation.

This balanced approach helps you diversify risk while maximizing tax benefits over your investment horizon.
