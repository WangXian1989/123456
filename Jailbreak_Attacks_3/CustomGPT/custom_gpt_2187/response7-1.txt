Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your tax efficiency and help you reach your financial goals. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth if you meet the income requirements.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax (Traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **IRA:** Same as 401(k). A Traditional IRA may reduce taxable income now, while a Roth IRA grows tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Gains are taxed at capital gains rates—prefer long-term investments to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Typically invest in higher-growth options since these accounts benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on taxable investments, such as index funds or ETFs, and consider tax-loss harvesting strategies.

### 4. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Sample Distribution Strategy
1. **Max out 401(k) to employer match**
2. **Contribute to IRA (max allowed)**
3. **Fill any gaps or additional savings in taxable accounts**

### 5. **Emergency Savings**
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a separate savings account, typically covering 3-6 months of living expenses.

### Final Tip
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation, considering factors like age, retirement goals, and risk tolerance.
