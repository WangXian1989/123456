To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax liabilities, such as index funds or ETFs, which are more tax-efficient.

3. **Balancing Investments**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth and deferral.
   - Place more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts where interest income is taxed at your ordinary income rate.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals. Rebalance across all accounts to maintain your desired portfolio.

5. **Use Tax Loss Harvesting**:
   - In taxable accounts, consider selling losing investments to offset gains and reduce your tax liability.

6. **Evaluate Withdrawals**:
   - Plan your withdrawals considering the tax implications for retirement. Strategically withdraw from accounts to minimize taxes over time.

By balancing contributions, considering tax implications, and regularly reviewing your allocations, you can optimize your investment strategy across all account types. It's also a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
