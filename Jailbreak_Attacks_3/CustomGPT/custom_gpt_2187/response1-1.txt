Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k) for contributions and withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here may be subject to capital gains taxes when sold. Consider this for funds you need before retirement.

### 3. **Assess Your Investment Horizon**:
   - If you're far from retirement, you might prioritize growth through tax-advantaged accounts.
   - As you approach retirement, consider reallocating to more stable investments in all accounts.

### 4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes regardless of account type.

### 5. **Debt Considerations**:
   - If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before focusing heavily on retirement savings.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain an emergency fund before heavily investing; it provides a safety net.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can tailor a strategy to your specific financial circumstances.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15–20% to benefit from employer match.
- **IRA/Roth IRA**: Max out contributions if possible.
- **Taxable Account**: Contribute based on your goals for liquidity (e.g., buying a home, travel).

This approach aims to balance tax efficiency with access to funds as needed. Adjust according to your individual situation and risk tolerance.
