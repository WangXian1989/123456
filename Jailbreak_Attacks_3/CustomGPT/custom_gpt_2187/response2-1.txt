Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can enhance your overall investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types and Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Often offers employer matching. Contributions are tax-deferred, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs allow tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth on contributions made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Offer flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k) First (if there's a match):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA Next:** Consider maxing out a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your income and tax strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts Last:** Use these for additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals to determine the asset allocation across all accounts.
   - **Diversification:** Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account.

### 4. **Account Allocation:**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize long-term growth tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding lower-growth investments (like bonds or stable value funds) to minimize tax implications.

### 5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - **Regular Review:** Reassess your allocations periodically based on market performance, life changes, or shifts in financial goals.
   - **Rebalance as Needed:** Adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Be mindful of how withdrawals from each account will be taxed, especially in retirement.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If unsure, consulting with a financial planner can help tailor a strategy to suit your specific situation and goals.

Adjust your distribution strategy based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance for the best outcomes.
