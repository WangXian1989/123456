The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few personal factors, including your age, income level, financial goals, and tax situation. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Depending on your income, you may be eligible for a traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). Roth IRAs are particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, such as credit card debt, focus on paying that down first before making additional contributions to your retirement accounts. The interest on such debt often exceeds potential investment returns.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are typically less tax-efficient than those in retirement accounts. However, they offer more flexibility. You may consider contributing here after maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, especially for short-term goals or if you need access to funds without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are well-diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance. This may require balancing asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) differently in each account based on tax implications.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind that investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) may be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while stocks that may appreciate significantly could be held in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

7. **Continuous Review**: Regularly review your investment strategy and allocation to adapt to any change in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Overall, a balanced approach prioritizes maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, managing debt, and ensuring investments are appropriate for your financial goals. It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
