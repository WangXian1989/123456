The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts really depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially "free money".

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Tax-Efficient Investing in Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates. Municipal bonds can also be a good choice since they're often tax-exempt.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts. If you're in a lower tax bracket, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement. Generally, it's advisable to draw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax laws and retirement planning, working with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your situation.

Ultimately, the right strategy balances immediate tax benefits against your long-term financial goals and needs.
