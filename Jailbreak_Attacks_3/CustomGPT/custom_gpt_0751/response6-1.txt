When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account factors such as tax implications, contribution limits, and your overall financial goals. Here's a strategic approach to guide your decision:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match (if available). This is essentially “free money.” Aim to maximize your contributions up to the limit.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Assess Your Taxable Accounts:**
   - Invest in taxable accounts for funds you might need in the near future. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Determine Your Investment Strategy:**
   - Generally, place higher growth investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) to defer taxes on gains.
   - Hold more stable or income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts since their tax implications can be more favorable.

4. **Rebalance as Needed:**
   - Review your investments periodically and adjust distributions based on performance, changing risk tolerance, or life circumstances.

By strategically allocating your investments among these accounts, you can optimize growth potential while managing tax implications effectively. If in doubt, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique situation and goals.
