Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match as it's essentially free money. Aim to maximize this account up to the contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing employer matching in your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Immediate Cash Needs**:
   - Maintain a liquidity buffer in your taxable accounts for emergencies or immediate expenses. Itâ€™s wise to have 3-6 months of living expenses saved in cash or easily accessible investments.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Taxable accounts can be beneficial for investments that generate capital gains and qualified dividends, as they may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Be mindful of tax implications from selling investments; strategies like tax-loss harvesting can be employed to minimize taxes.

4. **Diversification Across Account Types**:
   - Consider maintaining a diversified portfolio across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and investment time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - In retirement, strategize withdrawals to manage tax liability effectively. Generally, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then from tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs, leaving tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs for last.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
