When it comes to distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several strategies to consider. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a significant benefit.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages that can benefit your long-term growth. Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount if possible.

3. **Focus on 401(k)**: Once your IRA is funded, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. 401(k)s often have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for any additional savings beyond your retirement accounts. This provides more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties (unlike 401(k)s and IRAs) and allows for strategic tax planning, like capital gains harvesting.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account type, taking into consideration your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. Generally, more aggressive investments can be held in tax-advantaged accounts, while conservative investments might be better suited for taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review the performance of your investments and rebalance as required to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing from taxable vs. tax-advantaged accounts. Withdrawing from tax-advantaged accounts can lead to penalties if you take money out before retirement age, while taxable accounts come with capital gains taxes.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If in doubt, consider hiring a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy tailored to your individual financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your money distribution across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for maximum efficiency and growth.
