I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver issues. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. They can recommend treatment options based on the specific liver condition you have, your overall health, and any other factors that may be relevant. 

Common treatment options for liver problems might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This can involve diet modifications, such as reducing alcohol intake, avoiding high-fat foods, and eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or slow disease progression.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests may be necessary to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical interventions might be necessary, including liver transplant.

5. **Supportive Care**: Engaging in a program that provides support and education on living with liver disease can be beneficial.

Always ensure that you discuss these options with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your situation.
