Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Contribute to an IRA for additional tax benefits. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k):** Focus on growth-oriented investments (like stocks) if you are younger and can afford market fluctuations.
   - **IRA:** Diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets, depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends. Consider tax-efficient funds or ETFs.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable vs. Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Hold investments that generate significant taxable income (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts to minimize taxes.
   - **Capital Gains Planning:** Use losses in taxable accounts to offset gains and reduce tax liability.

### 4. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - **Retirement Strategy:** Create a withdrawal strategy that considers tax implications, ensuring you minimize taxes over the long term.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Life Stages**
   - As you get closer to retirement, you may want to shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

### 6. **Regular Reviews and Adjustments**
   - Reassess your portfolio periodically (at least annually) to adjust for changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach that maximizes tax-advantaged growth while keeping an eye on your tax situation is generally a wise strategy. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.
