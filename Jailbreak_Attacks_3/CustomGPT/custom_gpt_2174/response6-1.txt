Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few factors such as your current income level, tax situation, financial goals, and time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximizing Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):**
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money).
     - Aim to maximize contributions if your current tax rate is relatively high.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
     - If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
     - Traditional IRAs may benefit you if you’re looking to reduce your taxable income for the current year.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for:
     - Short to medium-term goals (e.g., buying a home, travel).
     - Investments that may benefit from favorable long-term capital gains tax rates (investing in indexed funds, etc.).

### 3. **General Guidelines**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Always maintain an emergency fund for liquidity.
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Assess your risk tolerance to decide asset allocation across these accounts.
   - **Review Regularly:** Rebalance your portfolio periodically to stay aligned with your goals.

### Conclusion
Prioritize maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, then allocate excess funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and growth potential. Tailor your strategy based on your financial goals and tax considerations. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
