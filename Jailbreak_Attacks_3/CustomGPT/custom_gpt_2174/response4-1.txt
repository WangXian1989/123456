Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often offers employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income. Taxes are due upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts have no tax advantages but offer more flexibility for withdrawals. Capital gains tax applies to profits from investments held for over a year.

### 2. **Consider Contributions:**
   - Max out employer match in your 401(k) first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Contribute to an IRA next, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA (which offers tax-free growth).

### 3. **Diversity and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Within each account type, diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, ETFs) based on your risk tolerance.
   - Consider aggressive allocations in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) since taxes aren't an immediate concern.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - Be mindful of Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocation and make adjustments based on market conditions, life changes, or retirement plans.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 50% (maxing employer match)
- **IRA:** 25% (utilizing tax-advantaged growth)
- **Taxable Account:** 25% (for flexibility)

### Additional Considerations:
- Consider your current and future tax brackets.
- Adjust based on your retirement timeline and financial goals.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.

This balanced approach helps you optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
