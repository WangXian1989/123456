Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often has employer match; pre-tax contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred; Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax benefits; however, you can access funds without penalties.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Max Out IRAs:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions.
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** Aim to contribute the maximum allowed, especially if you're in your peak earning years.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for money you need in the short term or after retirement.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Place bonds or high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 5. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Diversify investments based on risk tolerance and goals. Consider a mix of equities, bonds, and funds.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalance:**
   - Continually assess your portfolio’s performance and adjust contributions as needed, especially as you near retirement.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice, consider working with a financial advisor who can tailor a plan to your specific circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you'll create a balanced approach to managing your investments across your different accounts.
