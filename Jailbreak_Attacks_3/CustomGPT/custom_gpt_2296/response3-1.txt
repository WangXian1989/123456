The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment strategy, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating money to other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Treatment**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Taxes are paid when you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement (including earnings) are tax-free, provided certain conditions are met. Consider prioritizing contributions to a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized. Use these accounts for investments that may generate significant gains or income that you'd prefer to keep taxable.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes in each account to reduce risk. Consider factors such as your age, risk tolerance, and investment goals when making these selections.

4. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**: Your distribution strategy should consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. For example, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Regularly Reassess Your Allocation**: Personal financial situations can change, so it's important to regularly review your investment allocation and make adjustments as needed based on changes in income, expenses, life circumstances, or market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation, helping you create a balanced distribution strategy that maximizes potential growth while considering tax implications.

By assessing your goals and understanding the tax implications of each account type, you can make informed decisions on how to effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
