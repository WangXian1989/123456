Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, and personal circumstances. Here are some steps to consider for an effective distribution strategy:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Each account type has different contribution limits and tax benefits. For 2023, the limits are:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (plus an additional $7,500 if you're 50 or older)
   - IRA: $6,500 (plus an additional $1,000 if you're 50 or older)
   - Taxable accounts: No limit, but capital gains and dividends will be taxed.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Tax Strategy Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as income.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Growth and dividends from investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, making them less tax-efficient for long-term growth compared to retirement accounts.

4. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxes on growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate taxable income (like bond funds) since such investments are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your portfolio periodically to ensure it remains aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals. 

6. **Consider Future Tax Brackets**: Evaluate your expected tax situation in retirement compared to your current situation. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) could be beneficial.

By understanding each account's features and tailoring your contributions strategically, you can create a balanced investment portfolio that aligns with your financial goals while optimizing your tax position.
