The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match—this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, distributions during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, your contributions might be tax-deductible (Traditional) or tax-free upon withdrawal (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so consider holding tax-efficient investments, like index funds or tax-managed funds.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that you are diversifying your investments across all accounts. This can help spread risk and improve returns over the long term.

4. **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits for each account type. For example, in 2023, you can typically contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) and $6,500 to an IRA, with additional catch-up contributions allowed if you're over 50.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Tailor your investment strategy based on the account type:
   - More aggressive investments (like stocks) can fit well in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) since you won’t touch these funds until retirement.
   - Consider more conservative investments for taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Before allocating a significant portion to retirement accounts, ensure that you have built a sufficient emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a readily accessible account.

7. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your long-term financial goals. If you plan to retire early and need access to funds, consider how much you'll need in taxable accounts versus tax-advantaged accounts.

8. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level and ensure that each account aligns with your financial goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual situation, especially regarding tax implications and investment choices.
