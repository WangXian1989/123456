It is essential to consider your financial goals, investment horizon, and risk tolerance when determining how to allocate funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: Both 401(k)s and IRAs provide tax benefits. Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA may reduce your taxable income, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Evaluate whether a traditional or Roth account is more beneficial based on your current tax rate versus your expected rate in retirement.

3. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 401(k)s, the limit for employee contributions is generally higher compared to IRAs.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diversified asset allocation within these accounts. Consider your investment mix based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, with a balance of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments, such as bonds or high-yield funds, in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes. Conversely, consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**: Periodically review your investments and contributions as your financial situation and market conditions change. Make adjustments as necessary to stay aligned with your overall goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure how to best distribute your money, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your unique financial situation.

By evaluating these factors, you can better determine the optimal way to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
