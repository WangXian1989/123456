When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to take into account your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on contributions to your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income for the year, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current and expected future tax brackets when deciding between traditional and Roth accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments in each account are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance, age, and investment goals. 

4. **Consider After-Tax Contributions**: If you have already maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account for additional flexibility and liquidity.

5. **Evaluate Withdrawals**: Keep in mind the rules around withdrawals from each type of account, as penalties may apply for early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your distribution strategy as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

It’s often a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan that considers your unique circumstances.

Regardless of where you choose to place your money, focusing on a balanced approach that aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance is key.
