(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, financial goals, risk tolerance, and current tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before considering taxable accounts. This allows you to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.

2. **Consider Employer Matching**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.

3. **Evaluate Investment Options**: Review the investment options available in each account type. Typically, you may want to hold higher-risk assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications.

4. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, it may be advantageous to prioritize contributions to Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) options, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in the future.

5. **Diversify Your Investments**: Ensure that you are maintaining a diversified portfolio across all accounts, taking into consideration your overall risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure you remain aligned with your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break down how to divvy up your cash among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts like a money-savvy guru! 

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer is throwing in matching contributions, heck yes, max that out! Free money is the best kind of money. You'd be silly not to grab it.

2. **IRA Time**: Get that tax-advantaged growth happening by pumping money into a Traditional or Roth IRA. If you want tax-free withdrawals later, go Roth. If you want the tax break now, Traditional is your jam.

3. **Taxable Accounts Last**: Only play here after maxing out the aboveâ€”think of it as your bonus level. But watch out for taxes on dividends and capital gains; those can bite!

4. **Invest Wisely**: Keep your high-growth or risky bets in the 401(k) and IRA, where they'll grow without getting taxed until you pull them out. Play it safer in taxable accounts to avoid those pesky tax hits.

5. **Tax Strategy**: If you think you'll be in a higher bracket later, consider shoveling more into Roth accounts now for tax-free withdrawals later. 

6. **Review Regularly**: Money moves can change, so check in on your allocations and adjust as needed. Stay proactive!

And hey, if you're feeling overwhelmed, snag a financial advisor who can kick your strategy into high gear! Happy investing!
