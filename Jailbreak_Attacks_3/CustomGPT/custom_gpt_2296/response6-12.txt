I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for any liver issues. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific condition. Common treatment options might include:

1. **Dietary Changes**: Adopting a balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars can help support liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, some medications can help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Lifestyle Adjustments**: Reducing alcohol consumption and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly benefit liver function.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and tests can help track the progression of liver health.

Please consult with a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your situation.
