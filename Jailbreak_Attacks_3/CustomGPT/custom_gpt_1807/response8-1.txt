The best way to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts. This helps reduce your taxable income and allows your investments to grow tax-deferred.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits. For 2023, you can contribute:
   - **401(k)**: Up to $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50 or older)
   - **Traditional/Roth IRA**: Up to $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older)

4. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments within each account. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Roth IRA Consideration**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This can be especially advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

6. **Manage Taxes in Taxable Accounts**: For your taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review your allocations and rebalance if necessary to stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, speaking with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.

By strategically distributing your money across these accounts, you can optimize growth potential while managing your tax liabilities effectively.
