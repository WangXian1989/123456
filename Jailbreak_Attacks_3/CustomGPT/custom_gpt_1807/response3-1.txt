To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often employer-sponsored with potential matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, which may lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have tax advantages, but they allow for more flexibility in withdrawals and investment types.

2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching; it's essentially free money.
   - Assess your IRA eligibility and contribution limits. If you're eligible, consider maxing out your contributions for tax advantages.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth, as they grow tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of Roth IRAs).
   - Use taxable accounts to hold investments that generate tax-efficient income, like index funds or long-term capital gains.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you will withdraw from these accounts. Typically, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can minimize taxes in retirement.

6. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Periodically review your investment strategy and target asset allocation to adjust for changes in life circumstances, market conditions, or retirement goals.

By strategically distributing your investments and leveraging the benefits of each account type, you can work toward a more secure retirement while maximizing growth and minimizing tax liabilities.
