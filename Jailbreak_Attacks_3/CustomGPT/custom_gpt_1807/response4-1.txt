To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Max out contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider whether a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA is better for you based on your current tax bracket and future expectations. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds or ETFs. This allows for favorable capital gains treatment and tax-loss harvesting.

2. **Investment Selection**:
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like individual stocks or aggressive mutual funds) to defer taxes on gains.
   - Use stable or bond investments in your taxable account to minimize tax impact from dividends.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure your overall asset allocation remains aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals, adjusting the distribution across accounts as necessary.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits for each account type, and prioritize where you contribute based on your financial goals and tax situation.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your long-term objectives and risk profile.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation.
