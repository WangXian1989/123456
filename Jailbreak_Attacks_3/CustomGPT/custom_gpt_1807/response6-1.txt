To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the annual maximum if possible.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your financial situation and tax outlook.

### 2. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once youâ€™ve maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This allows more flexibility in withdrawals without penalties.
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient funds to minimize the taxable income generated from these investments.

### 3. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow untaxed.
   - Place more conservative investments (like bonds or fixed income) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

### 4. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Monitor your allocations at least annually to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
   - Adjust contributions based on market performance, tax law changes, and personal circumstances.

### 5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**
   - If unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on detailed financial planning and tax efficiency.

By strategically balancing these accounts, you can optimize your tax efficiency and align your investments with your long-term financial goals.
