To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions, depending on your current tax situation.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Growth Investments**: Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - **Income-Generating Investments**: Consider placing bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to utilize lower capital gains tax rates.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all account types to manage risk and achieve balanced growth.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically for retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs to maximize tax efficiency.

5. **Ongoing Monitoring**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, fees, and changing financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also ensure your strategy aligns with your long-term goals.
