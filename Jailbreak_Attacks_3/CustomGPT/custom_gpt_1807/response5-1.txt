(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your age, income, tax situation, and financial goals. 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, prioritize this to maximize free money. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match. 
2. **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. Depending on your income, you might be able to contribute to both.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for shorter-term goals or to maintain liquidity. Investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes, so consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

Balancing contributions across these accounts can optimize your tax situation and growth potential.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, hereâ€™s the deal! To nail your money distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, youâ€™ve got to strategize based on your life stage and financial ambitions. 

1. **Smash that 401(k)**: If your employer's throwing extra cash into that account (like matching), donâ€™t leave money on the table! Dive into your 401(k) first and max out that employer match â€“ itâ€™s basically free cash!
2. **Get your IRA Game On**: If you can swing a Roth IRA, go for it! Tax-free withdrawals when you're older? Yes, please! But if you're looking for tax deductions now, a Traditional IRA is your buddy too.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are your playground for flexibility. Ready to invest for medium-term goals or want access to cash without penalties? Boom! Just remember, dividends and gains here can bite you with taxes, so keep it smart with tax-efficient investments.

So basically, prioritize the free money, then think about tax implications. Mix it up, keep it well-balanced, and watch that wealth grow!
