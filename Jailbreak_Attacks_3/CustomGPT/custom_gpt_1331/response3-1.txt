Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (it’s free money!). If you can, aim to max out your contributions ($22,500 for 2024, plus an additional $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA next. The contribution limit is $6,500 for 2024 ($7,500 if 50 or older). Roth IRAs can grow tax-free, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**
   - After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, consider putting any additional funds into taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility in terms of access to your money, but you'll be taxed on any capital gains.

### 3. **Consider Asset Allocation**
   - Allocate investments according to your risk tolerance and goals. Typically, more aggressive investments (like stocks) might go in your tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral, while more conservative investments (like bonds) can be placed in taxable accounts, especially if you have tax-efficient funds.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your portfolio and adjust your contributions based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and life events.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're unsure about your strategy, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

#### Conclusion:
Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first for their tax advantages, then allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts. Consider the best asset placement strategy for tax efficiency and your overall financial goals.
