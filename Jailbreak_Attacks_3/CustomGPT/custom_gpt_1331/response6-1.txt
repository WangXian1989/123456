Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you're eligible, or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Assess Your Investment Goals**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need in the near future.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings where you won’t need the money for years.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio spread across all accounts to balance risk.
   - Adjust allocations based on your investment horizon and risk tolerance.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Place higher-growth assets in tax-deferred accounts to maximize tax-free compounding.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 20-30% of your total retirement savings
- **IRA**: 10-20% of total savings, based on your eligibility
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20-30% for liquidity and flexibility

### Regular Reevaluation
- Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Conclusion
Tailoring your distribution among these accounts allows you to optimize for growth while managing tax liabilities. Always consult a financial advisor to align strategies with your personal situation.
