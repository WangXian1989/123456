Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general framework to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. A Roth IRA is great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket then.
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit after securing the match. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for investments you might need before retirement. They offer flexibility but also come with capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, growth-oriented investments (like stocks) might go into tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds or more stable investments could go into taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on market changes and life milestones.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawals and gains in each account type to optimize your overall tax liability.

Ultimately, tailoring your strategy to fit your unique financial situation and goals is essential. Consulting a financial advisor can also be very helpful!
