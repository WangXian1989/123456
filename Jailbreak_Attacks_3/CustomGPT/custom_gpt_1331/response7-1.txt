Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to capture any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to max out if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Consider your tax bracket when choosing:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deferred growth; contributions may be tax-deductible.
     - **Roth IRA**: Tax-free withdrawals in retirement; contributions made with after-tax dollars.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These funds provide flexibility for withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Goals**
   - Align your investment choices in each account with your risk tolerance and time horizon:
     - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments if retirement is far off.
     - **IRA**: Diversify based on future income needs.
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Opt for tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Rebalance and Adjust as Needed**
   - Regularly review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and make adjustments as life circumstances change.

### Conclusion
A well-rounded approach maximizes tax benefits and aligns with your risk tolerance. Consult a financial advisor for a personalized plan that factors in your unique situation.
