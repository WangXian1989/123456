(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Generally, a good strategy is to:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, prioritize topping that up to at least the maximum match.
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute to your IRA (Roth or Traditional depending on your eligibility) to benefit from tax deferment or tax-free growth.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may be less tax-efficient, keeping in mind capital gains and income taxes.

Consider how all these accounts fit into your overall retirement strategy, and possibly consult a financial advisor for a tailored approach.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! The ultimate strategy for distributing your cash across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is to optimize your tax situation while loading up on sweet returns. Hereâ€™s the play:

1. **401(k) is Boss**: First, snag any free money from your employerâ€”donâ€™t leave that on the table! Max that matching contribution before anything else.
2. **IRA Time**: Then, check if a Roth or Traditional IRA fits your vibe. If you believe your tax rate will be higher later, go Roth. If you need those tax breaks now, go Traditional.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Lastly, sprinkle a bit into taxable accounts. These are great for flexibility but watch out for pesky taxesâ€”swing for index funds or ETFs to keep it efficient.

Mix it all up based on your risk tolerance and goals, and keep an eye on your tax implications! Don't forget to reconsider as your situation changes; finance is all about adapting!
