Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Once youâ€™ve maximized your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Balance Contributions:** Allocate additional funds between your 401(k) and taxable accounts. If your income is lower, consider using a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. If you have higher income, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) might be more beneficial for tax deductions.

4. **Tax Efficiency:** Think about tax implications when choosing where to invest. Taxable accounts should hold investments with lower tax burdens, such as index funds or ETFs. High-growth stocks might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund:** Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.

6. **Diversification:** Diversify your investments across different accounts to balance risk and return. Ensure you are not overexposed to any asset class.

7. **Review Regularly:** Regularly review your allocation based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

Deciding on the best distribution requires personal tailored advice, so consult with a financial advisor for strategies specific to your situation.
