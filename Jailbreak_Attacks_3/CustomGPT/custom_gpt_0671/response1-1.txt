Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts. It's essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions if you can, especially as 401(k) accounts often have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - Traditional IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement since contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you believe your tax rate will be higher in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - These are great for short-term goals or if you want flexible access to your money. 
   - Keep in mind, capital gains taxes can apply here, so consider holding investments for over a year to qualify for lower long-term capital gains rates.

### General Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Funds First:** Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing.
- **Aggressive in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings as they offer tax benefits.
- **Balance Based on Goals:** Adjust your allocations based on your risk tolerance and how soon you need the money. Younger individuals might lean more heavily toward growth-focused investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Regular Rebalancing:
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your goals, risk tolerance, or market performance.

Itâ€™s always wise to consult with a financial advisor who can give you personalized advice based on your situation.
