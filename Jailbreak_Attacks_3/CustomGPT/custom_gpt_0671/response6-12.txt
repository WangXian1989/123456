I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional who can assess your specific liver condition and recommend appropriate treatment options. Generally, treatment may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, limiting alcohol intake, and exercising regularly can improve liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver disease, medications may be prescribed to reduce symptoms or manage complications.

Please consult a healthcare provider for personalized medical advice.
