The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. 
   - **IRA**: After taking advantage of the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This could be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA/401(k)**: Contributions may be tax-deductible (traditional IRA) or deferred (401(k)), but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.

3. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Consider the types of investments in each account. For example, place higher growth potential investments in your tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts on gains. More conservative investments can be held in taxable accounts since they may generate less in short-term gains.

4. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before fully allocating to retirement accounts. This should typically cover 3-6 months of expenses and be kept in a liquid, easily accessible account.

5. **Long-Term Strategy**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy based on market conditions, changes in your income, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement, as it can greatly affect your tax situation.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your personal circumstances and goals for the best outcomes.
