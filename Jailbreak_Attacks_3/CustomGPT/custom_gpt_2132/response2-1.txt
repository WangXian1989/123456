Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** After securing the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA if you qualify for tax-deductible contributions (Traditional IRA) or if you want tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth IRA).

3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're age 50 or older), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older).

4. **Assess Your Tax Situation:** Contributions to a Traditional 401(k) and Traditional IRA can lower your taxable income, while contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars. Consider your current and expected future tax brackets.

5. **Diversify Investments:** Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to minimize risk.

6. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This offers more liquidity and flexibility for short-term goals.

7. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Given individual circumstances can greatly impact the best approach, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that meets your specific needs and goals.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy is one that balances tax efficiency with liquidity and aligns with your long-term financial objectives.
