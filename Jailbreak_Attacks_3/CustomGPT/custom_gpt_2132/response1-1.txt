To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** If you're in a higher tax bracket now, benefit from pre-tax contributions. If your employer offers a Roth option, consider that if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA:** A Roth IRA is tax-free on withdrawals in retirement, which could be advantageous if you believe your tax rate will increase. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now, which could be beneficial if you expect a lower tax rate in retirement.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account:
   - 401(k): $22,500 for individuals under 50 and $30,000 for those 50 and older (as of 2023).
   - IRA: $6,500 for individuals under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and older.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Regularly balance your investments among equity, bonds, and cash based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Typically:
   - **401(k):** Focus on long-term growth potential with a diversified mix of equities and bonds.
   - **IRA:** Depending on your retirement timeline, you might lean towards growth-oriented investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs. 

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan ahead for how you'll draw down funds from these accounts in retirement. Generally, itâ€™s best to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and save Roth accounts for last to maximize tax-free growth.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you're unsure, a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation, balancing your long-term goals and immediate financial needs.

By considering these factors, you can create a well-balanced approach to distributing your contributions across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
