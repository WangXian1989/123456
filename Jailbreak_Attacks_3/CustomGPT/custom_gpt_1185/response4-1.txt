Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, consider prioritizing this for tax-deferred growth. 
   - **Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in the same or a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure you have a diversified mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and make adjustments based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific needs.
