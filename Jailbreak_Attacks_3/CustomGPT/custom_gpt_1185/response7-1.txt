Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Max Out Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first.
   - **Consider Fees**: Choose low-cost investment options within the plan.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to fully contribute to your IRA up to the limit, prioritizing Roth if you expect higher taxes in retirement.
   - **Tax Diversification**: Having both traditional and Roth IRAs can provide tax flexibility in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Keep adequate liquid savings for emergencies.
   - **Invest for Growth**: Use taxable accounts for investments in stocks or funds that benefit from favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains).
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider municipal bonds or index funds to minimize tax implications.

### General Tips:
- **Rebalance**: Regularly assess your portfolio and rebalance as needed.
- **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Distribute in a way that minimizes your overall tax burden.
