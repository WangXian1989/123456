The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts. Keep in mind the tax implications of each account type.
   - Generally, more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) are better in taxable accounts, while less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) can be held in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Strategies like tax-loss harvesting can help.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, so anticipate your tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Adjust for Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors might favor equities for growth, while those closer to retirement may shift towards conservative investments.

5. **Create Emergency Funds**:
   - Ensure you have liquid savings outside of your retirement accounts for unexpected expenses.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on performance, changing goals, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your unique situation.
