Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund with 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid account.

2. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.
   - **Consider Tax-Deferred Growth**: The 401(k) offers tax advantages, so prioritize funding it, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

3. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. Contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Fund this if you believe you'll be in a higher tax bracket in the future. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits for both types of IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might want to access before retirement (like for a home purchase).
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts based on risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, higher-risk assets might be placed in tax-deferred accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your strategy to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market changes.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
