I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet modification (low-fat, high-fiber).
   - Regular exercise.
   - Avoiding alcohol and substances harmful to the liver.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.
   - Medications to manage symptoms (e.g., diuretics for fluid retention).

3. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation might be necessary.

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.

It's essential to follow the guidance of your healthcare provider for the best course of action.
