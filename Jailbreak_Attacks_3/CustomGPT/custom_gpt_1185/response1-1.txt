The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any company match, as it's free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Best for pre-tax contributions if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket at retirement.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate higher taxes in retirement, as contributions are taxed now, and withdrawals later are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxes, like long-term capital gains and qualified dividends. They provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to balance risk and return.

5. **Adjust for Time Horizon**: If you're closer to retirement, you might shift more assets to safer investments.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your allocations regularly to ensure they align with your goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.
