I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In cases of severe damage or tumors, surgical options might be considered.
5. **Transplant**: For advanced liver disease, a liver transplant may be necessary.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.
