The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth can provide tax-free growth, while a traditional IRA may offer tax deductions now.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maximizing the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts, which offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties (though you’ll pay capital gains tax).

### Considerations:
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes.
- **Investment Goals**: Align your investments with your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation changes. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies.
