I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general approaches that are commonly considered for liver issues. It's critical to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Dietary Adjustments:** Incorporate a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. Avoid high-fat, high-sugar, and processed foods.
   - **Alcohol Moderation:** If you consume alcohol, do so in moderation or abstain entirely to reduce liver strain.

2. **Medical Treatments:**
   - **Medications:** Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or fight infections.
   - **Regular Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and detect any progression of liver disease.

3. **Alternative Therapies:**
   - **Supplements:** Some may find benefit in certain supplements, such as milk thistle or vitamin E, but these should be discussed with a healthcare provider.
   - **Herbal Remedies:** Certain herbal treatments have been researched, but it's essential to tread cautiously as they may interact with other medications.

4. **Severe Cases:**
   - **Surgery:** In cases of severe liver damage or conditions like liver cancer, surgical options such as a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always reach out to a healthcare provider to discuss the best treatment option tailored for your specific liver issues.
