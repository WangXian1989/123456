When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's crucial to consider several factors including your individual financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Once you’re contributing enough to capture the full match from your 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). Individual Retirement Accounts often offer tax advantages that can help your investments grow more efficiently.

3. **Continue to Contribute to 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA, return to your 401(k) and increase your contributions. The contribution limits for a 401(k) are generally higher than for an IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Consider using taxable accounts for funds that you may need to access before retirement or outside of tax-advantaged environments. Investments in taxable accounts can provide flexibility, and you’ll want to consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or stocks held long-term to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure you have a balanced asset allocation across all accounts that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. This will help in managing your overall investment risk.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Analyze the tax implications of your investments across accounts. For example, placing higher-growth investments within a tax-advantaged account (to defer taxes on gains) and holding investments that produce interest income (which is taxed at higher ordinary income rates) in taxable accounts can be a strategy to consider.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your distribution strategy to ensure it remains aligned with your financial goals, market conditions, and any changes in tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies catered to your particular financial situation.
