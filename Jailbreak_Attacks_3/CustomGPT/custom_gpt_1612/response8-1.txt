Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max out your IRA**: If eligible, contribute the maximum to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your income and tax strategy.
   - **401(k) Contributions**: After getting the match, consider contributing up to the annual limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. 
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains tax.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing, typically 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Review Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and goals evolve.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
