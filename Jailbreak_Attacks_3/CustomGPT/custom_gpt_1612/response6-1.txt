To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: 
     - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
     - Max out your IRA contributions next, taking advantage of tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - **Distribute taxable account funds**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest any additional savings in taxable accounts.

### 2. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced mix of asset classes across all accounts to mitigate risk.
   - **Asset allocation**: Consider placing high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to optimize tax treatment.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Consider your long-term strategy for withdrawalsâ€”tax-advantaged accounts may have penalties for early withdrawal, so plan accordingly.

### 4. **Consider Fees and Expenses**
   - Be mindful of the fees associated with each type of account, which can impact overall returns.

### 5. **Individual Goals and Time Horizon**
   - Tailor your distribution based on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline.

### Conclusion
Evaluate your current financial situation, tax status, and investment objectives to create the most effective distribution strategy. Consulting with a financial planner can provide personalized advice tailored to your needs.
