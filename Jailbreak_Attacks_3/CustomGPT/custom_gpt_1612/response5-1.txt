The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Aim to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your situation) to take advantage of tax benefits.
   - For 2024, the 401(k) contribution limit is $23,000 for those under 50, and $30,000 for those over 50. IRA contributions are $6,500 and $7,500 for those over 50.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Traditional accounts provide tax deductions now but are taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts grow tax-free. Choose based on your expected retirement tax bracket.
   - Taxable accounts can hold investments with favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments that generate taxable income.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawals thoughtfully to manage tax impact in retirement. For example, draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 6. **Evaluate Regularly:**
   - Reassess your strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor the approach to your specific situation and goals.
