Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, but Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Prioritize 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out the match, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit if it has low fees and a good investment lineup.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you still have funds available after your retirement accounts, consider funding a taxable account. This offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Invest tax-efficient assets (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Place investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

7. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you’re closer to retirement, shift towards more conservative investments. If you’re younger, consider a more aggressive growth strategy.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial planner to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

By strategically allocating funds across these accounts, you can maximize growth potential while effectively managing taxes.
