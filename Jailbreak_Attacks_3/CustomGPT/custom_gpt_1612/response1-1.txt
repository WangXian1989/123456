When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some key points to keep in mind:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available—this is essentially free money!
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are tax-deferred, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional and Roth):**
   - **Tax Advantages:** Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals. Roth IRAs use after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits. Maximize contributions based on your financial situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer more access and flexibility since there are no penalties for early withdrawals.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Earnings may be subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding lower-turnover investments here to minimize liabilities.

### Recommended Strategy:
- **Start with the 401(k):** Max out contributions to get the employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA:** Depending on your tax situation, choose between a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA.
- **Use Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings:** Once you’re maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments.

### Overall Balance:
Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts, tailoring your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to help tailor a strategy that suits your specific situation.
