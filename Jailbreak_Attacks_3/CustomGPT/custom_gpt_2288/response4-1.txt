Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on a few factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Once you're maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income, you may qualify for tax-deductible contributions with a Traditional IRA or tax-free growth with a Roth IRA.

3. **Focus on Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate high taxable income, like bonds, or for short-term savings goals due to their flexibility.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These are better for long-term investments, as their tax advantages can help your money grow more efficiently.

4. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before fully funding retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified, reducing risk.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
