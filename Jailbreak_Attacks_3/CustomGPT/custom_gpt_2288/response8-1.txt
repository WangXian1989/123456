To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount, focusing on a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as these can be taxed favorably compared to ordinary income.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on high-growth investments, as they grow tax-deferred or tax-free, maximizing your returns over time.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure alignment with your financial goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider your withdrawal strategy to minimize tax impacts, such as withdrawing from taxable accounts first or strategically utilizing tax-deferred accounts for income.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, especially regarding your specific financial situation and goals.

By combining these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth while managing taxes effectively.
