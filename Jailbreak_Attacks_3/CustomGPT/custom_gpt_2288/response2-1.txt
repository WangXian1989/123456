To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Investments grow tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs use after-tax dollars. Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Dividends and capital gains are taxed in the year they occur.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before investing in taxable accounts. Limits for 2024 are $23,000 for 401(k)s (under 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (under 50).

4. **Asset Location**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on gains.
   - Keep income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid paying taxes on interest.

5. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and return.
   - Consider your overall asset allocation (stocks, bonds, cash) collectively, rather than in isolation by account.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations as market conditions change and as you approach retirement.

7. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - As you near retirement, consider how and when you’ll withdraw from each account to minimize taxes and prolong your savings.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailor your strategy based on your unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Implementing these strategies can help optimize your investment potential while managing tax liabilities effectively.
