Balancing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**:  
   - **Maximize contributions**: If your employer matches contributions, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Choose the right investment options**: Select a mix of stocks and bonds that aligns with your risk tolerance. 

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:  
   - **Fund your IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA can offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions.
   - **Long-term investments**: Use this account for growth-oriented investments, as it benefits from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:  
   - **Diversify for flexibility**: Taxable accounts allow for more flexibility, with no contribution limits. Use these for short- to medium-term goals or for investments you may want to access without penalties.
   - **Tax-efficient investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, in this account to minimize tax impact on capital gains.

### Allocation Strategy:
- **Emergency fund first**: Ensure you have savings set aside for emergencies.
- **Age-based allocation**: As a rule of thumb, younger investors might lean more towards stocks for growth, while those nearing retirement might shift towards bonds for stability.
- **Rebalance regularly**: Review your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Conclusion:
Consulting with a financial advisor can also be beneficial to tailor an approach specific to your situation. Always consider your personal risk tolerance and investment goals!
