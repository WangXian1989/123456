Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can maximize growth and minimize tax liabilities. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also provides potential tax deductions for contributions, but taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free if rules are met. Consider prioritizing this account if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Generally more flexible but subject to capital gains taxes. Utilize these for investments intended for shorter time horizons.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Based on your time horizon and risk tolerance, allocate your investments:
   - Higher-risk investments (like stocks) are typically better suited for accounts intended for long-term growth (like IRAs and 401(k)s).
   - Consider placing income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts where you can defer taxes.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your portfolio and rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation as investment values change over time.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes. Start with taxable accounts to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider professional advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

By strategically distributing your investments, you can work towards optimizing growth, minimizing tax impact, and ensuring a comfortable retirement.
