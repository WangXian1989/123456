The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some considerations to guide your decision:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, and the funds grow tax-deferred.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Investment Options**: IRAs often have a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Money in taxable accounts is accessible without penalties before retirement age, allowing for more liquidity.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when trading. Holding investments long-term can minimize these taxes.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Max out employer match in 401(k)**.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (consider a Roth for tax-free growth).
3. **Deposit additional funds in 401(k)** up to contribution limits.
4. **Invest excess funds in taxable accounts** for flexibility and liquidity.

### Rebalancing:
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in financial goals, or shifts in market conditions.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal circumstances.
