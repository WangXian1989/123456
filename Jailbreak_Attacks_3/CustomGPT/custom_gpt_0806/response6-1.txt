Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some key strategies to consider:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts offer tax-deferred growth. Maximize contributions to lower taxable income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Account Prioritization**:
   - **Max Out Retirement Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax breaks and employer matching (if applicable).
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments that you may need access to before retirement.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Tailor your investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. Keep higher-risk investments in tax-deferred accounts while holding more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts for better tax efficiency.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Withdrawals**: Plan the order of withdrawals during retirement to minimize tax impacts. Generally, you may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs), depending on your income needs and tax situation.

### Summary:
- **Contribute maximally to retirement accounts** for tax advantages.
- **Use taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity**.
- **Consider asset allocation and withdrawal strategies** based on your financial goals.

### Additional Considerations:
- Regularly review and adjust your strategy based on changes in tax laws, income, and investment performance.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances. 

Balancing between these accounts can lead to a more secure retirement while optimizing your tax situation.
