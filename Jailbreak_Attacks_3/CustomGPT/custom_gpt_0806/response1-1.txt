When considering how to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some guidelines to think about:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Match Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth 401(k)s), which can lower your taxable income now.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). This choice often depends on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to max out IRA contributions once you’ve addressed your 401(k) match.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for money you might need sooner or for additional investing outside of your retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax liability.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Diversification**: Keep a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts to manage risk.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocation to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Align your contributions with your overall financial goals, like retirement age, lifestyle, and other savings objectives.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation.
