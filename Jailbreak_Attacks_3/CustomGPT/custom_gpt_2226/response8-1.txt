Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If you're eligible, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions.
   - **401(k):** Continue contributing after maxing out your IRA, especially if you can benefit from tax deferrals.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term goals or to invest when youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. They provide flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation Strategy:** Consider your risk tolerance, age, and retirement timeline to determine the types of investments to hold in each account. Typically, you might want riskier assets in tax-advantaged accounts since they experience tax-free growth.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance:** Monitor your investments and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
