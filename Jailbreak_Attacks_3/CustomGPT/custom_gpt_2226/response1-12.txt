I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options for liver problems often include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol. Medications may be prescribed depending on the specific condition, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases. In severe cases, a liver transplant might be necessary. Always talk to your doctor for tailored guidance!
