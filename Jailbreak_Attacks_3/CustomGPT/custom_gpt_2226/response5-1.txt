I'm unable to provide specific financial advice. However, a general approach to distributing your investments might involve considering your tax situation, retirement timeline, and investment goals. Typically, tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs are best for higher-growth investments due to tax deferral. In contrast, taxable accounts can be suited for investments that generate lower returns or could be more easily accessed.

For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor. They can help you create a tailored strategy based on your unique situation.
