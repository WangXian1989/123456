Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it's essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out contributions (up to the annual limit) if you are in a higher tax bracket, as contributions are made pre-tax.

2. **IRA** (Roth or Traditional): After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. With a Roth IRA, you pay taxes upfront, and withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. A Traditional IRA gives you a tax break today but taxes withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate long-term capital gains and qualified dividends, which are usually taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income. This can be good for flexibility and access to funds before retirement without penalties.

**General Strategy**:
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) then IRA).
- Maximize employer matching.
- Use taxable accounts for additional investments after maxing out tax-advantaged options.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
