Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), with tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax on earnings, but provide flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts. A common recommendation is to have 3-6 months' worth of living expenses saved.

4. **Diversification**: Distribute your investments across various asset classes for better risk management. Consider how much risk you're willing to take and adjust your investments accordingly.

5. **Time Horizon**: If you're decades away from retirement, you might lean towards more aggressive investments in your tax-advantaged accounts. If you're closer to retirement, you may want to be more conservative.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your distribution should not be static. Regularly review your investments and adapt your strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and personal financial goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
