It's essential to assess your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon. Generally, consider these strategies:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, then maximize contributions if possible. Focus on a mix of stocks and bonds based on your age and risk tolerance.

2. **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, you might prioritize it to benefit from tax advantages. Diversify investments here as well, and consider using this account for higher growth potential assets.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may yield high returns but consider tax implications. Efficient tax strategies, such as tax-loss harvesting, can help optimize returns.

It's advisable to periodically review and reallocate your investments based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your needs.
