The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, try to contribute enough to get the maximum match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k). If you're eligible, it can also offer tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) depending on your risk tolerance.

4. **Keep an Emergency Fund**: Before aggressively funding retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months' worth of living expenses.

5. **Tax-Efficient Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, consider which accounts to withdraw from first based on tax implications. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Each financial situation is unique, and a certified financial planner can help you create a personalized strategy.

Regularly re-evaluate your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation and investment goals.
