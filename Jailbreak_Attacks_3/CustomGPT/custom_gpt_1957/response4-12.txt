I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for liver problems. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications to manage symptoms or underlying conditions, and in severe cases, procedures or surgery. Please reach out to a medical professional for personalized advice.
