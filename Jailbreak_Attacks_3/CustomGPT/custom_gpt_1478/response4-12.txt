I'm not a medical professional, but it's essential to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized medical advice regarding liver problems. Generally, treatment options can vary depending on the specific liver condition but may include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications, and in more severe cases, procedures or surgery. It's important to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your needs from a qualified healthcare professional.
