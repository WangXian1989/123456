To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Depending on your income, you may benefit from tax deductions if you choose a traditional IRA, or enjoy tax-free withdrawals in retirement with a Roth IRA.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Understand the tax implications of each account type. 401(k)s and IRAs provide tax advantages for retirement savings, while taxable accounts allow for more flexibility with withdrawals but may incur capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts. Depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon, allocate assets into stocks, bonds, or other investment vehicles.

5. **Adjust Contributions Based on Goals**: If your immediate financial goals require liquidity, you might allocate more to your taxable accounts. For long-term growth, focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals. Adjust as necessary based on changes in market conditions or personal circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If youâ€™re unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your financial situation.
