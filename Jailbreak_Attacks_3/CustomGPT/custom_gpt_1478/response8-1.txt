To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA. The contribution limits for IRAs are often lower, but they offer tax advantages that can be beneficial.

3. **Contribute Beyond Basic Needs**: After maximizing the employer match and IRA contributions, continue to fund your 401(k) until you reach its contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Liquidity**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or those with a time horizon of less than five years. These provide liquidity without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation and Diversification**: Diversify investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider holding different types of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to optimize tax efficiency.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications. For example, placing high-growth stocks in your tax-deferred accounts (like your 401(k) or IRA) can be advantageous, as you won't pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation according to market performance and your changing goals or risk tolerance.

8. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized planning based on your specific financial situation and goals.
