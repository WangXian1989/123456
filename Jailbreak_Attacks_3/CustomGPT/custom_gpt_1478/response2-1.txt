Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), start by contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum allowable limit, particularly if you are in a high tax bracket. Consider a traditional 401(k) if you want to lower your taxable income now, or a Roth 401(k) if you prefer to pay taxes now for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. If eligible, try to use a Roth IRA for its tax-free growth and withdrawal benefits. Traditional IRAs can also provide tax benefits, but withdrawals are taxed in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, any additional savings can go into a taxable account. This is useful for short-term goals or if you want flexible access to your funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. This is essential across all accounts but consider tax implications for where to hold certain types of investments (e.g., bonds might be taxed higher in taxable accounts).

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocations as your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions change.

It's essential to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation. Would you like more details on any of these accounts or strategies?
