Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (Traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Withdrawals are taxed (Traditional).
   - **IRA**: Similar tax benefits as the 401(k). Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest after-tax money; be mindful of capital gains taxes on withdrawals.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate liquidity for emergencies before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account, consider diversifying your investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement, considering tax efficiency (e.g., withdrawing from taxable accounts first).

7. **Periodic Review**: Regularly reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
