To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Each account type has different contribution limits. Max out your employer-matching contributions in your 401(k) first, as that's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Good for tax-deferral on contributions. Focus on this for high contribution limits.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals. Consider your current versus expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible but less tax-advantaged. Use these for short-term goals and investments.

3. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - **Stocks vs. Bonds**: Allocate higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - **Dividends and Interest**: Place income-generating investments in tax-deferred accounts, or in taxable accounts if you're in a lower tax bracket.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for withdrawals based on tax implications. Taxable accounts might be accessed first for shorter-term needs, while tax-advantaged accounts should be preserved for retirement.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically assess your portfolio to ensure alignment with your financial goals and adjust contributions based on changes in income or financial circumstances.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
