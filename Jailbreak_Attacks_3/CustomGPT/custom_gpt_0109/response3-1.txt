Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA (Roth or Traditional), as these accounts offer tax advantages. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is ideal for short-term goals or more flexible access to your funds.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, then, diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications. Generally, itâ€™s better to hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable ones to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
