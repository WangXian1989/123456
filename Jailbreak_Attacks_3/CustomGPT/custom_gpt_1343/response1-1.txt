Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Understand the contribution limits for each account type:
   - **401(k)**: $22,500 for 2023 (plus $7,500 catch-up if over 50).
   - **IRA**: $6,500 (plus $1,000 catch-up if over 50).

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and Traditional IRA): Focus on assets that generate higher taxable income, like bonds or REITs, since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that produce lower taxable income, such as index funds or tax-efficient funds, to minimize annual tax liabilities.

4. **Roth Accounts**: If eligible, consider Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This can be especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified, regardless of account type. This helps reduce risk.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Adjust your allocations at least annually to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your specific needs and goals.

Strategies may vary based on your income, tax situation, and retirement goals, so itâ€™s important to adapt these general tips to your personal situation.
