Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - After maxing out the employer match, focus on maximizing contributions to your IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA (tax-free growth) or a traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need access to before retirement, like emergency funds or short-term goals.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) to tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-deferred or tax-free. Keep more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they typically generate interest that is taxed at higher rates.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review your allocations yearly and rebalance as necessary to ensure you stick to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing tax-deferred accounts to lower your taxable income now.
