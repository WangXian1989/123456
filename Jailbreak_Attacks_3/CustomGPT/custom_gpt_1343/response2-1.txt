Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Fund an IRA:**
   - Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers tax deductions now but taxes on withdrawals later.

### 3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k):**
   - After maximizing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the contribution limit. This can provide tax-deferred growth and lower your taxable income.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - If you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can be useful for mid-term goals or if you anticipate needing funds before retirement.

### 5. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 6. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts and the impact of withdrawals on your tax bracket during retirement.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your portfolio and rebalance as needed to maintain your target asset allocation.

### 8. **Long-Term Goals:**
   - Align your investments with your overall financial goals, such as retirement, buying a home, or funding education.

### Conclusion
Consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation. This structured approach can help optimize your investments and tax efficiency over time.
