Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a structured approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have any high-interest debt, consider paying that down first before maximizing retirement contributions.

3. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, max out your IRA (traditional or Roth) next. A Roth IRA is especially beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After contributing to your IRA, continue to increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This provides more liquidity and flexibility for short-term goals.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure investment choices align with your risk tolerance across all accounts. Generally, you might want riskier assets in tax-advantaged accounts and safer investments in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Review**: Life changes and market conditions can affect your strategy. Review and adjust your allocations annually or as needed.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
