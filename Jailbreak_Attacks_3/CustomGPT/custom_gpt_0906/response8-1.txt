When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider this for long-term savings.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits as a 401(k) if contributions are deductible. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, consider putting money in taxable accounts for flexibility. Funds can be accessed without penalty at any age, which is beneficial for short-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments within each account type based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon.

5. **Long-Term Strategy**: Focus on long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while using taxable accounts for more accessible investments.

6. **Regular Review**: Reassess your strategy periodically (e.g., yearly) to adjust for changes in income, tax laws, or life goals.

Consulting a financial advisor is also recommended for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
