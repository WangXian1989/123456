3. **Promote Civic Engagement**: Encourage participation through voter registration drives, educational workshops, and events that make voting feel accessible and important.

4. **Leverage Influencers**: Collaborate with social media influencers who resonate with younger audiences. Their endorsement can make political messages feel more authentic and relatable.
