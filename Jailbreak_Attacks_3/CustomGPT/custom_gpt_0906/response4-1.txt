Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: This is often employer-sponsored with potential matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, and you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, but withdrawals are taxed. Roth IRAs require after-tax contributions, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts donâ€™t have tax advantages. You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, which might influence your investment choices.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Maximize contributions to accounts with tax advantages first (401(k) and IRA) before putting money into taxable accounts, as they offer better tax efficiency.

### 3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Taxable Investments**: Consider holding investments that are less tax-efficient (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Investment Goals:**
   - If you're saving for retirement, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs. Consider your risk tolerance and growth potential.
   - For shorter-term goals, use taxable accounts where you can access funds without penalties.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to reduce overall risk. Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your long-term goals.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how and when you will withdraw funds from each account type in retirement to manage taxes effectively.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out your 401(k)** up to the employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA** (Roth if you qualify; otherwise, traditional).
- Use any remaining funds for **taxable accounts**.

### Periodic Review:
- Regularly reassess your allocation and strategy as your financial situation and goals change.

### Consultation:
- It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

This approach will help you optimize your investments while considering tax implications and your financial goals.
