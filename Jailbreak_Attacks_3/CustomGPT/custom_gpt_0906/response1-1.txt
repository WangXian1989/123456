Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out the IRA, increase your 401(k) contributions, especially if you're in a high tax bracket. You'll benefit from tax deferral on your contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for any additional savings you want to keep more accessible. These accounts can provide liquidity if you need funds before retirement.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawal strategies. Generally, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to let tax-deferred accounts grow longer.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Typically, you might have more aggressive investments in accounts with tax advantages and more conservative investments in taxable accounts because of capital gains taxes.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and contributions as your financial situation and market conditions change.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also a good idea for personalized guidance.
