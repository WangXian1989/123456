The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**
   - If you qualify, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. 
   - A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment to 401(k) for contributions and withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Earnings are subject to capital gains taxes and dividends may also be taxed as ordinary income.

### 4. **Invest for Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - Invest for long-term growth in your 401(k) and IRA. Choose investments with higher expected returns, as these can benefit more from tax deferral.

### 5. **Maintain Liquidity in Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for expenses you might need access to in the short term. Consider investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**
   - Younger individuals might lean more heavily toward stocks for growth, while those nearing retirement might shift to more conservative investments.
   - Rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can offer tailored advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of your total contributions (max employer match)
- **IRA**: 10% of your total contributions (full contribution limit if eligible)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remainder for flexibility and short-term goals

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions with tax benefits and employer matching first before allocating to taxable accounts. Adjust based on your financial situation and market conditions regularly.
