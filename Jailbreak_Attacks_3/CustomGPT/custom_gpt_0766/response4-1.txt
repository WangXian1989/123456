Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum allowed if you're not close to retirement age. Consider if you want to do traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax) contributions based on your current vs. future tax rates.
   - **IRA**: If you still have extra funds after maxing out your 401(k) and you qualify, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your contributions in tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments, though you’ll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon when deciding the allocation within these accounts. Generally, retirement accounts can hold more aggressive investments because the money is meant to be long-term.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to ensure you maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be aware of tax implications in taxable accounts, as holding investments for over a year can lead to lower capital gains taxes.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
