Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general framework to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**

- **401(k) Contributions:**
  - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
  - Consider contributing to the max limit ($22,500 in 2024, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

- **IRA Contributions:**
  - After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax goals.
  - For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+).

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**

- **Traditional vs. Roth:**
  - Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s give you a tax break now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
  - Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them better if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**

- **Asset Allocation:**
  - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Stocks for growth, bonds for stability, etc.
  - Keep in mind that tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**

- **Save for Short-Term Goals:**
  - If you have short-term goals (like buying a home), consider keeping funds in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.
  
- **Tax-Efficient Investing:**
  - In taxable accounts, focus on long-term capital gains and tax-efficient Index funds or ETFs.

### 5. **Periodic Reassessment**

- Regularly review your allocations as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

### Example Allocation Strategy

Assuming you want a balanced approach:

- **60% in 401(k)**
- **20% in IRA**
- **20% in taxable investment accounts**

### Conclusion

Personal financial situations vary significantly, so it might be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your needs. They're equipped to provide detailed strategies considering all nuances of your financial landscape.
