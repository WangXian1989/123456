Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan with potential matching contributions. Contributions are tax-deferred.  
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Provides tax advantages for retirement savings. Traditional IRAs have tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.  
- **Taxable Accounts**: No special tax advantages, but they provide flexibility and can be used for short-term or long-term goals.

### 2. Maximize Employer Match
If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

### 3. Focus on Tax Efficiency
- **401(k)**: Contribute up to the limit if your employer match is maxed out. Consider the tax implications of withdrawing funds.
- **IRA**: Max out your IRA contributions (especially Roth if you qualify), as they offer significant tax advantages and flexibility in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings if you’ve hit your limits on tax-advantaged accounts. Consider investments that optimize tax efficiency (e.g., index funds or tax-managed funds).

### 4. Balance Risk and Growth
Distribute your investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline:
- **Younger investors** may lean more towards stocks or aggressive growth funds in retirement accounts.
- **Older investors** or those nearing retirement may shift to more conservative investments to preserve capital.

### 5. Regularly Review and Rebalance
Keep an eye on your allocation and adjust as necessary based on market performance and life changes. Regular rebalancing can help maintain your desired risk level.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your total income, maxing out to get the full employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out annual contributions (e.g., $6,500 for those under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and older).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any additional savings here, focusing on investments that yield favorable tax treatment.

### Conclusion
Tailor your distribution strategy to your specific financial situation and objectives, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
