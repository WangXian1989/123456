Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach you can consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Short-term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need to access in the next few years.
   - **Long-term Goals**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match – it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA after you’ve contributed to your 401(k). Depending on your income, you can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

### 3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell investments, so consider holding investments for at least a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. **Review Periodically**
   - Adjust your contributions and investment allocations based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or market conditions.

### Example Distribution
- **Max out 401(k) up to the employer match.**
- **Contribute the maximum allowed to an IRA.**
- **Use any remaining funds for taxable accounts to maintain liquidity for short-term needs or future investments.**

### Conclusion
It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan tailored to your specific circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance. They can also help you navigate tax strategies effectively.
