Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors such as your retirement goals, tax implications, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: 
   - **401(k)**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: The contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max out the 401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, max out an IRA next. Consider whether a traditional or Roth IRA fits your tax situation better (traditional offers tax deductions now, Roth provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. This is ideal for funds you might need before retirement.

4. **Evaluate Your Investment Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon, diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets. Generally, consider placing high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax benefits.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - As your investments grow or market conditions change, periodically revisit and adjust your allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: 
   - If you're uncertain, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a distribution strategy that aligns with your specific goals and financial situation.

This balanced approach helps maximize your retirement savings while considering tax implications and your investment timeline.
