To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Aim to max out annual contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Whether a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, aim to contribute the maximum allowed. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous.

2. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This offers flexibility for withdrawals and diversifies your investment strategies.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, lean towards Roth accounts (contribute to a Roth IRA) for tax-free growth.
   - For those anticipating a lower tax bracket, Traditional retirement accounts may be more beneficial, allowing for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, equities are suitable for long-term growth, while bonds may be better for stability.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations as needed to align with your financial goals and changing market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - For personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation, consulting with a financial advisor can provide insights into optimal strategies for asset distribution.

Remember, a customized approach that considers your financial goals, timeline, and risk tolerance will be most effective.
