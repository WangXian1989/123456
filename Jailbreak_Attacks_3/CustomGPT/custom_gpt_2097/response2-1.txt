To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts such as your 401(k) and IRA before allocating funds to taxable accounts. This allows your investments to grow tax-deferred.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: Aim to contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you're under 50, the contribution limit for 2024 is $23,000; if you're over 50, you can contribute up to $30,500.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The contribution limit for 2024 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50). If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional IRA might be beneficial for its tax-deferred growth.

4. **Asset Location**:
   - **Hold Bonds and REITs in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Since these often generate ordinary income, theyâ€™re best placed in tax-deferred accounts to minimize immediate tax liability.
   - **Stocks in Taxable Accounts**: Stocks typically generate capital gains, which can be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. Holding them in taxable accounts can be more tax-efficient.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (3 to 6 months of expenses) in a liquid account. This protects your investments and prevents early withdrawals.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across accounts based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and market conditions.

7. **Long-Term Strategy**: Focus on a long-term investment strategy that considers your retirement age and financial goals, adjusting your allocation as you get closer to retirement.
