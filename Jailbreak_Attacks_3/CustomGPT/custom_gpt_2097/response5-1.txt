Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. Consider increasing your contributions as your financial situation allows.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax strategy.

2. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize contributions to 401(k) and IRA accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or emergencies since they offer more flexibility.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to a Traditional 401(k) and IRA lower your taxable income now, while Roth accounts provide tax-free growth.
   - Taxable accounts can incur capital gains tax, so consider tax efficiency when investing.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to balance risk and return.

5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**:
   - Reassess your allocation periodically based on life changes (job change, marriage, etc.) and market conditions.
