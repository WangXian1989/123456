Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, which is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.
- **Consider a Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Balance Contributions Based on Goals
- **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for money you may need access to before retirement. These accounts offer flexibility.
- **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on your 401(k) and IRA for retirement savings to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.

### 3. Assess Tax Implications
- **Tax Efficiency**: Hold less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient ones (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan withdrawals carefully during retirement to manage tax brackets effectively.

### 4. Regularly Rebalance
- Monitor and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals to ensure alignment with your overall strategy.

### 5. Consult a Financial Advisor
- For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial professional.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions effectively across these accounts can optimize your savings while minimizing tax impacts over time. Adjust your strategy based on your evolving financial situation and goals.
