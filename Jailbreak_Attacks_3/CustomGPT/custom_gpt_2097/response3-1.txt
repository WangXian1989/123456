Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Often offers employer matching, contributions are pre-tax (tax-deferred), and generally has higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional) or not (Roth), but earnings grow tax-free in a Roth account.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages but allow for flexibility in withdrawals and investment choices.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer matches. 
   - For 2023, the maximum contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50). For IRAs, it’s $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

### 3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts to minimize your tax burden.
   - Assess whether a Traditional or Roth IRA better fits your tax bracket now versus in retirement.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Invest in a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts to mitigate risk.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for how and when you’ll access these funds in retirement. Taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties if needed before age 59½.
   - Aim to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

### 6. **Adjust Based on Goals**
   - If retirement is far off, you might prioritize aggressive growth in retirement accounts.
   - As you near retirement, consider shifting to more conservative investments, particularly in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - At least annually, review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your life circumstances (like changes in income or family status).

### Example Allocation Strategy
1. **401(k):** Max out contributions for employer matching.
2. **IRA:** Contribute up to the maximum limit, choosing between Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Invest additional funds here for flexibility and access, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Conclusion
Regularly reassess your strategy based on performance and changes in your financial situation. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice.
