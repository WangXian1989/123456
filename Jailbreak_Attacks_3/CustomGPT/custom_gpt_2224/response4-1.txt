I'm glad to help with that! However, it's important to note that I can't provide personalized financial advice. I can, however, offer some general strategies that you might consider when deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### General Strategies

1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions to these accounts may be tax-deductible, and they grow tax-deferred. Think about maximizing contributions to these accounts before moving to taxable options.
   - **Roth Options:** If available, consider a Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA, which can provide tax-free growth.
  
3. **Distribute Based on Tax Bracket:**
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, lean towards tax-advantaged accounts now.

4. **Liquidity Needs:**
   - Keep in mind your short-term liquidity needs. Taxable accounts provide flexibility for immediate access to funds.

5. **Investment Choices:**
   - Different accounts may have different investment choices. Diversifying across accounts can help manage risk.

6. **Long-Term Goals:**
   - Align your distribution with your long-term financial goals and retirement plans.

### Suggestions for Distribution:
- **Prioritize 401(k)** for any contributions up to the match.
- After maximizing matching contributions, **fund your IRA**.
- Finally, invest in **taxable accounts** as necessary for varied needs.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
