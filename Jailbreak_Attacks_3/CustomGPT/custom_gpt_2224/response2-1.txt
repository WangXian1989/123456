When allocating your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions lower your taxable income; taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also defer taxes, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay capital gains taxes on earnings.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Short-term needs might be better suited for taxable accounts.
   - Long-term retirement investments can be prioritized in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out employer 401(k) contributions to benefit from any matching.
   - Contribute to IRAs up to the limit (e.g., $6,500 for individuals under 50).

4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Assess your comfort with market volatility and how soon you’ll need withdrawals.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions (especially if matched)**.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (preferably a Roth if you qualify for tax-free withdrawals).
3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Additional Investments** if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged options.

### Regular Review:
Monitor your allocations regularly to align with changing goals, market conditions, and tax laws.
