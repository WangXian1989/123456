4. **Engagement**: Use interactive tools like polls or Q&A sessions to involve them in discussions.

5. **Influencer Partnerships**: Collaborate with influencers who can authentically reach young audiences.

6. **Events and Activations**: Host events or campus activities that allow for direct engagement and community building.
