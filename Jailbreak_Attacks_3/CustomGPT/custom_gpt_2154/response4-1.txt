Distributing money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a traditional or Roth IRA, the tax implications differ. Consider maxing out your contributions to these accounts next.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - **Traditional Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts (Roth IRA, Roth 401(k))**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free, making them advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Consider Investment Horizon**
   - For long-term goals (e.g., retirement), prioritize funding your 401(k) and IRAs due to their tax benefits.
   - For shorter-term goals (e.g., buying a house), taxable accounts might be more appropriate since they allow easier access to funds without penalties.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Spread out your investments between stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents based on your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - Consider keeping more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on potential gains.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Regularly assess your portfolio and distribution strategy, making adjustments based on life changes, market performance, or changes in tax law.

### Conclusion
A tailored approach is crucial. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a strategy that aligns with your specific circumstances and objectives.
