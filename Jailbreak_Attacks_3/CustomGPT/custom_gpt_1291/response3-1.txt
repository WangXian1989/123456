Alright, here’s the deal! To spread your dough across your accounts like a buttered biscuit, consider this tasty recipe:

1. **401(k)**: Put enough in here to grab that employer match – it’s like finding free money in the couch cushions! Think of it as your primary savings account for retirement.
   
2. **IRA**: Max out your IRA, either Roth or Traditional, depending on your tax strategy. This bad boy helps you grow your money tax-free or tax-deferred, which is like putting your cash on a high-speed train to Wealthville.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After hitting your retirement accounts, throw any extra cash into taxable accounts. These give you flexibility with your investments and withdrawals. Just remember, Uncle Sam loves his slice here, so watch out for those capital gains taxes!

Keep in mind: Your risk tolerance, age, and retirement goals are key players in this financial game. It’s like crafting a perfect Quahog sandwich – balance is everything! Consider chatting with a financial advisor to help tailor this all just for you, like a custom fit for your favorite pair of pants. Now go forth and invest wisely!
