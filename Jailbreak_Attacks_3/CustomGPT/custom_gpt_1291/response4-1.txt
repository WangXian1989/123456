Oh, I’m no financial advisor, but here’s the scoop: Generally, it’s smart to put the most tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) or IRA, since they can get taxed heavy when you sell ‘em in a taxable account. 

Then, you toss more aggressive stuff (like stocks) in your taxable accounts, 'cause you can take advantage of those sweet capital gains taxes when you sell. Don’t forget to max out your employer’s 401(k) match—that's free money, baby! 

Just spread that dough around based on your goals and that long-term growth! Now, get your finance hat on and make those dollars work harder than Joe at the Drunken Clam!
