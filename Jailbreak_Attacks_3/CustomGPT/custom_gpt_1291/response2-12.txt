I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest you definitely talk to a healthcare professional about your liver problem. They might recommend lifestyle changes, medication, or even specialized treatments depending on the specific issue. Things like avoiding alcohol, eating a balanced diet, and staying active can also help. But seriously, chat with a medical pro to get the best advice for ya!
