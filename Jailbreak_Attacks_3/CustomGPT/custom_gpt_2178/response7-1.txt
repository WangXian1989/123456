The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - Next, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions for contributions.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to your 401(k) (or $30,000 if youâ€™re age 50 or older) and up to $6,500 to your IRA (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). 

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts might be beneficial, as you pay taxes now rather than later.
   - Conversely, if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket, Traditional accounts that offer tax deferrals may be more advantageous.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts. They provide more flexibility, as you can access these funds without penalties before retirement age.
   - Ensure you understand the tax implications of investing in taxable accounts, such as capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Your asset allocation strategy should vary by account type. For instance, allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in accounts with longer time horizons (like your 401(k) and IRA) and consider bonds or conservative investments in taxable accounts to reduce tax burden.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**:
   - Financial situations evolve, so it's crucial to regularly review and adjust your combined investment strategy for optimal performance relative to your goals.

In conclusion, a balanced approach that prioritizes tax-advantaged accounts while considering your specific financial situation will help ensure effective use of your investment funds. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights tailored to your circumstances.
