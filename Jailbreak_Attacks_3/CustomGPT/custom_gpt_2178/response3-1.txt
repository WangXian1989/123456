Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here’s a suggested approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Your IRA**: After maxing out the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. If you’re self-employed or your employer doesn’t offer a match, consider a solo 401(k) or a SEP IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility with withdrawals and can be beneficial for funding short-term goals or emergencies.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to mitigate risk.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

7. **Tax Efficiency**: Keep in mind tax implications; for example, holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts can be beneficial as interest income is usually taxed at a higher rate.

It’s advisable to consult with a financial planner who can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.
