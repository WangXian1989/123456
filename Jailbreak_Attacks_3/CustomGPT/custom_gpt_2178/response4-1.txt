Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax Contributions**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) reduce your taxable income in the year you make them, which can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, you can either defer taxes until withdrawal (traditional) or pay taxes now for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth). Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates when deciding which type of IRA to fund.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the contribution limits for IRAs and whether you’re eligible for full contributions based on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts provide more flexibility since you can access your funds without penalties, unlike retirement accounts. They are ideal for short- to medium-term savings goals.
   - **Capital Gains Considerations**: Investments in taxable accounts can be subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize your tax burden.

**Overall Strategy**:
- Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to get the employer match.
- Next, consider funding an IRA, especially if you want to take advantage of additional tax-advantaged savings.
- Any remaining funds can be directed towards a taxable account for more flexibility and access.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that considers your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
