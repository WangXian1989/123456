Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Employer matching can greatly enhance this account’s growth.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have tax advantages but offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term versus long-term needs.
   - Use 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth, while allocating a portion in taxable accounts for immediate needs.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match.
- **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, consider contributing to an IRA to benefit from tax advantages.
- **Allocate Remaining Funds to Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for more liquidity.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- 50% in your 401(k)
- 30% in your IRA
- 20% in taxable accounts

### Final Note:
- Regularly review and adjust your portfolio based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
