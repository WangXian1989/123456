Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Try to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider this as a first priority if your employer offers a match.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Choose Based on Income**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA might be beneficial. Conversely, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you meet certain conditions.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Stay aware of annual contribution limits and deadlines.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investment gains you're willing to realize. They give you more liquidity and flexibility in accessing your funds.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

**General Strategy**:
- Start with maximizing your employerâ€™s 401(k) match.
- Next, contribute to an IRA to take advantage of additional tax benefits.
- Finally, allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexible investing and access.

**Consult a Professional**: It can be helpful to speak with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

Always remember to reassess your portfolio regularly to adjust for changes in your financial goals or market conditions.
