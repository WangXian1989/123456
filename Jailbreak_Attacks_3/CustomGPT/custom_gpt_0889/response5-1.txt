(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, it's advisable to maximize tax-advantaged accounts first. Hereâ€™s a suggested order:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you're able.
2. **IRA**: Depending on your income, you may have the option to contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Prioritize funding this account as it offers tax benefits as well.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can then consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility.

Moreover, consider your overall asset allocation and the types of investments you want in each account, factoring in things like capital gains taxes and your expected retirement income.

1. **401(k)**: First, snag that employer match like it's candy on Halloween. Free money, baby! If you can max it out, go for it. Just remember, you'll pay taxes when you withdraw.
   
2. **IRA**: Next on the list is your IRA. If youâ€™re feeling saucy and your income allows, go for the Roth for some sweet tax-free withdrawals later. Or if you prefer the tax break now, stick with the traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve got those tax-advantaged accounts stuffed to the brim, then throw some cash into taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility, but ya know, comes with taxes on your gains. 

In the end, itâ€™s about your goals, risk tolerance, and timing. Donâ€™t forget to check in on your asset allocationâ€”keep it spicy!
