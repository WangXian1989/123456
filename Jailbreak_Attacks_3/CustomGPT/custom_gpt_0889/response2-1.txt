The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs before investing significantly in taxable accounts. This helps reduce your taxable income and allows your investments to grow tax-deferred.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: For 401(k) contributions, aim to reach the contribution limit, which is $20,500 for 2022 (or $27,000 if you're over 50). If you can afford it, consider contributing enough to maximize your employer match and then move on to funding your IRA.

4. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on whether you qualify for a Roth or traditional IRA, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next (up to $6,000 for 2022, or $7,000 if over 50). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may offer upfront tax deductions.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest any additional funds in taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility but come with tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon when determining the asset allocation within each account. Generally, you might want to hold more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to optimize for tax efficiency since those earnings can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

7. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind that interest income and short-term capital gains from taxable accounts are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate. Holding investments for over a year can qualify for long-term capital gains rates, which are usually lower.

8. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review and rebalance your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure that it aligns with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

9. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances and goals, particularly if you have complex financial situations or substantial investments.

Before making any decisions, consider your current financial situation, future income expectations, and overall retirement goals.
