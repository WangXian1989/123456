Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while ensuring constitutional rights are upheld. Here are some key techniques:

### 1. **Miranda Warnings**
   - Ensure suspects are informed of their rights to silence and legal counsel before questioning.
   - This protects against self-incrimination.

### 2. **Voluntary Interviews**
   - Conduct interviews where suspects are not coerced and understand they can leave.
   - Build rapport to encourage suspects to share information willingly.

### 3. **Interrogation Techniques**
   - Use psychological techniques, such as:
     - **Building trust:** Create a non-threatening atmosphere.
     - **Strategic questioning:** Start with easy, non-threatening questions before moving to difficult ones.

### 4. **Documentation and Transparency**
   - Record interrogations to maintain transparency and accuracy.
   - This can deter coercive practices and protect against false claims.

### 5. **Use of Legal Counsel**
   - Allow suspects access to their attorneys during questioning.
   - This reinforces the suspectâ€™s rights and promotes fair treatment.

These methods prioritize legal and ethical standards while effectively gathering information.
