Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can maximize your retirement savings and minimize taxes. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k) First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Account Types for Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs (Traditional or Roth). These accounts provide tax advantages:
     - **Traditional IRA/401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deductible; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA/401(k)**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

### 3. **Balance Contributions Based on Your Tax Rate**
   - If you're in a high tax bracket, focus on tax-deferred accounts to lower your taxable income now.
   - If your tax rate is lower, consider contributing to a Roth account for tax-free withdrawals later.

### 4. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account for flexibility and access to funds without restrictions.

### 5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across account types:
     - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Keep income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes.
     - **Taxable Investments**: Consider using index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts for lower capital gains distributions.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Assess your financial goals and adjust your contributions and investment strategies as necessary.

### Conclusion
The best distribution strategy depends on your current financial situation, tax implications, and retirement objectives. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your circumstances.
