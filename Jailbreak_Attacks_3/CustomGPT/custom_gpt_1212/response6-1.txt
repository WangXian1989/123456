Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some best practices:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**  
   - **401(k):** Typically offers employer matching contributions and has higher contribution limits. Good for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Offers tax advantages. Choose Traditional for tax deduction now, or Roth for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No contribution limits, but subject to capital gains tax on profits. Useful for flexibility and short-term goals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
   - **Fund an IRA:** If eligible, contribute to an IRA, focusing on Roth for tax-free growth or Traditional for tax deductions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds you may need in the short-term or for investments beyond retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Hold bonds and other income-generating assets here to minimize taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold stocks that you plan to hold long-term to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Maintain Liquidity**
   - Ensure you have enough in taxable accounts for emergencies or immediate needs, while maximizing growth in retirement accounts.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** 15% of income (maximize employer match)
- **IRA:** Up to annual limit (e.g., $6,500)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remaining savings for flexibility

Adjust the percentages based on your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio as needed.
