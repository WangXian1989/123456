Determining how to allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Long-term Growth:** If retirement is your primary goal, lean towards tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-term Needs:** For goals within the next 5-10 years, taxable accounts may be more appropriate.

### 2. **Consider the Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Taxes are owed upon withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), with tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized.

### 3. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this “free money” first.

### 4. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Max out contributions to receive employer matching.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible, as it offers tax-free growth and flexibility at retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts, aligning with your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically re-evaluate your distribution strategy as your financial situation and goals evolve.

### Sample Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your income, depending on employer match.
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Max contribution limits ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings after maximizing the above.

#### Example:
- **Age:** 30  
- **Income:** $75,000  
- **401(k) Contribution:** 15% = $11,250 (plus match)  
- **IRA Contribution:** $6,500 to Roth  
- **Taxable Account Contribution:** Remainder of savings.  

By focusing on both tax efficiency and investment growth, you can effectively distribute your money to support your financial goals.
