To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Tax-deferred contributions; potential employer match; good for high contribution limits.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Tax advantages; lower contribution limits; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but flexible withdrawals; best for short-term goals or emergency funds.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Max out employer match in 401(k):** This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRA:** Consider maxing out a Roth IRA if you qualify based on income, as it offers tax benefits in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for additional savings once you reach limits on tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds):** Place in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds):** Place in taxable accounts for favorable capital gains treatment.

### 4. **Adjust According to Goals**
   - **Long-term retirement (401(k) and IRA):** Focus contributions here.
   - **Short-term goals (taxable):** Use taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Within each account, diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Final Thoughts
Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.
