When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (with catch-up contributions if you're over 50).
   - **Employer Match**: Make sure to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Reserve bonds or higher-yield assets for tax-advantaged accounts where you won't incur annual taxes on interest.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Withdrawals in Retirement**: Plan when to withdraw funds. During retirement, you may want to start with taxable accounts to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.
   - **Roth Conversions**: Consider converting portions of your traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, especially in lower-income years. This strategy can help reduce taxes in retirement.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Keep your current tax bracket in mind when distributing your investments. For example, if you are in a higher tax bracket, it might make sense to lean more into tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Ensure that each account holds a mix of asset classes tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your strategy and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal financial goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan based on your specific situation and goals.
