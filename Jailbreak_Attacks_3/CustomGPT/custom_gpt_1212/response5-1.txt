The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Money in taxable accounts can be more flexible, allowing access without penalties. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes. Use these accounts for more tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

### 3. **Diversify Across Accounts**
   - Spread your investments across accounts to take advantage of different tax treatments. For instance, you might choose to hold higher-growth investments (which may have higher potential taxes when sold) in your tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Place bonds and other income-generating securities here to defer taxes on income.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA):** Hold high-growth stocks that you plan to leave invested for many years to maximize tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate less frequent or lower taxes, such as long-term capital gains.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions based on market conditions, changes in your financial situation, and retirement goals.

### Conclusion
A balanced strategy that prioritizes tax-advantaged accounts while considering your investment goals will help you maximize returns over time. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations tailored to your specific situation.
