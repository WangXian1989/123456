When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Roth IRA (if eligible):** If you're eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA, consider funding it after maximizing your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:** The tax treatment of withdrawals will vary:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals are tax-free if rules are followed.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains in taxable accounts may be subject to taxation, so consider your expected tax bracket.

4. **Emergency Fund:** Maintain a separate emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid account.

5. **Investment Objectives:** Decide on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon for each account type, as this will guide your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.).

6. **Diversification:** Within each account type, ensure that your investments are diversified to mitigate risk.

7. **Regular Contributions and Rebalancing:** Regularly contribute to each account according to your strategy, and periodically revisit your allocations to ensure they align with your goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice taking into account your entire financial picture, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

Ultimately, your specific situation will dictate the best allocation of funds, so consider your age, income, retirement goals, and any other financial obligations you have.
