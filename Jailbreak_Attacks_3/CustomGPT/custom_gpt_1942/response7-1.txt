Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, it's often best to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if you can afford to redirect more of your income.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) (up to the match), consider contributing to either a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. These accounts are more flexible but may incur capital gains taxes upon selling assets.

4. **Consider the Tax Implications**: Keep an eye on the tax implications of capital gains, dividends, and withdrawals, especially in taxable accounts. Investments that generate a lot of interest income (like bonds) might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Adjust Based on Your Goals**: If you have short-term goals (e.g., saving for a home in the next few years), you might want to keep more liquid assets in your taxable accounts. For long-term growth, focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged locations.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regular rebalancing of your portfolio can help maintain your desired risk level and asset allocation.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
