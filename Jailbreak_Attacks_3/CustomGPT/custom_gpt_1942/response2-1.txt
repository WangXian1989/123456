The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider High Contributions:** If you're in your peak earning years, consider maximizing your contributions to take advantage of tax deferrals.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA:** Decide between a Roth IRA (tax-free growth) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth). Your choice may depend on your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement.
   - **Maximize Contributions:** If you can afford it, contribute the maximum allowed each year, especially to a Roth IRA if you qualify.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility and Access:** These accounts offer the most flexibility as you can withdraw funds without penalties (though taxes may apply). Use them for short-term goals or if you need liquidity.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds or indexes, as capital gains and dividends will be taxed. Consider holding bonds or higher-yield assets in tax-deferred accounts.

### Overall Strategy:
- **Prioritize Accounts**: Start with 401(k) contributions to get any employer match, then fund your IRA, and lastly allocate to taxable accounts.
- **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts tailored to your risk tolerance.
- **Periodic Review**: Reassess your allocations periodically and adjust as needed based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

### Consider Professional Advice:
If you're uncertain, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your unique financial situation.
