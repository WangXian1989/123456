The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situations, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute more if possible, especially if you have high-income years.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Both a 401(k) and a traditional IRA allow your investments to grow tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - **Tax-Free Growth**: A Roth IRA enables tax-free withdrawals in retirement, so if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, it might be a good choice.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts donâ€™t offer the same tax benefits, so consider holding investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are generally taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investment mix across all accounts is diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment time horizon.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your allocations across these accounts to maintain your desired risk levels and investment strategy.

5. **Future Needs**: Consider your short-term and long-term financial needs. Keep in mind that withdrawals from retirement accounts may have penalties or tax implications.
