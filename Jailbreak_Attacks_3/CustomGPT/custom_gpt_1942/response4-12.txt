I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that itâ€™s best to consult with a healthcare professional for your liver issue. Treatment options often vary based on the specific liver condition, its severity, and individual health factors. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, medications, and in some cases, medical procedures. Please seek medical advice for a personalized assessment.
