When distributing money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out your IRA (either traditional or Roth, based on your tax situation).

2. **Balance Contributions**: Once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, use remaining funds for your taxable account. This can provide flexibility for short-term needs, as it is easier to access compared to retirement accounts, which may have penalties for early withdrawals.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Remember that withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts can be taxed on capital gains, so think about your anticipated tax bracket at retirement when planning distributions.

4. **Emergency Fund and Liquidity**: Ensure you have enough liquid cash in taxable accounts to cover emergencies or short-term expenses, as retirement accounts generally impose penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation based on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and age. Make adjustments as needed to stay on track with your retirement planning.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
