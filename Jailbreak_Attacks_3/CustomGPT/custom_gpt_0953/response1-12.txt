I’m not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional about liver problems. Treatment options can vary based on the specific condition affecting your liver—common issues include fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis.

General approaches often include lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet, exercise, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight. Medications may be prescribed for conditions like hepatitis or other infections. Always follow the advice of your healthcare provider for the best treatment tailored to your situation.
