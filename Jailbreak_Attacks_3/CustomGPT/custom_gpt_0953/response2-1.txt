Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your tax situation. A Roth IRA might be advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your financial situation allows, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to its limit ($22,500 for individuals under 50 in 2023, with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution for those 50 and over).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can then go into taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and can be beneficial for mid-term goals, though they do not provide the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within these accounts, consider a diversified investment strategy tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon, often a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your distribution and adjust as your financial situation changes, ensuring you’re on track for your retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored strategies based on your unique circumstances.
