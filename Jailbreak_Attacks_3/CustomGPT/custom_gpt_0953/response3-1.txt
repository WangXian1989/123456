The best way to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and individual investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider maxing out an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation) to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.

3. **Contribute to Your 401(k)**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. This allows you to access funds without penalty before retirement age, and you may benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates on appreciated assets held for over a year.

5. **Consider Investment Types**: Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds or tax-exempt bonds) and place higher tax-burden investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Check Your Asset Allocation**: Make sure your overall investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline, distributing assets according to your strategy across all account types.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific circumstances. They can help optimize your strategy based on current financial goals and tax implications.
