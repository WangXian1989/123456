I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for liver problems as they can assess your specific situation and provide appropriate recommendations. Common treatment options for liver issues may include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthier diet, abstaining from alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight. Medications or procedures might also be necessary depending on the severity of the condition. 

If you have any concerns about liver health, please make an appointment with a doctor who can provide you with tailored advice.
