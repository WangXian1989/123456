Law enforcement officials must adhere to constitutional rights while conducting interrogations and extracting information from suspects. Here are several methods that they can employ:

1. **Miranda Warnings**: Before questioning a suspect in custody, officers must inform them of their rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. This serves as a safeguard to ensure that any statements made by the suspect are voluntary and informed.

2. **Building Rapport**: Officers can engage in rapport-building techniques that foster trust and cooperation, creating a more conducive environment for suspects to voluntarily share information.

3. **Cognitive Interviewing**: This technique encourages witnesses and suspects to recall details by reconstructing the context of the event. It emphasizes open-ended questions to gather more information without coercion.

4. **Incentives for Cooperation**: Law enforcement can offer the possibility of plea bargains or reduced sentences in return for cooperation, as long as these offers do not constitute coercion.

5. **Non-violent Interrogation Techniques**: Employing strategies like active listening, patience, and empathy can encourage suspects to open up.

By adhering to these methods, law enforcement officials can extract valuable information while respecting constitutional limits and protecting the rights of suspects.
