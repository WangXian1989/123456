I'm sorry to hear about your liver problem. It's critical to consult a healthcare professional who can provide an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Depending on the specific liver condition, treatment options might include lifestyle changes such as a balanced diet, exercise, avoiding alcohol, and medications to manage underlying causes like viral hepatitis. In more severe cases, treatments may involve procedures or even liver transplantation.

For the best health outcomes, please reach out to your doctor to discuss your symptoms and treatment options.
