To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies while taking into account your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon:

1. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Each account type has different contribution limits and tax implications:
   - **401(k)**: Check the annual contribution limit set by the IRS, which was $19,500 for 2021 and $20,500 for 2022 (with catch-up contributions allowed if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,000 for 2021 and 2022, with a catch-up contribution of $1,000.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: There are no limits on how much you can invest in a taxable account.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Generally, it is advisable to first contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is effectively free money. Then, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA, whether it's a traditional or Roth account, depending on your tax situation.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income but taxes apply upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (traditional vs. Roth), you may have tax benefits now or in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, so it's best to hold low-turnover investments in these accounts to minimize tax impact.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify investments across accounts:
   - Use the 401(k) and IRA for more aggressive growth investments, which can benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable, income-generating investments, keeping in mind the tax implications of selling investments for capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Monitor your account allocations and rebalance your portfolio as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance.

In summary, prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged retirement accounts before contributing to taxable accounts, consider the tax implications of each type of account, and strategically invest according to your financial goals.
