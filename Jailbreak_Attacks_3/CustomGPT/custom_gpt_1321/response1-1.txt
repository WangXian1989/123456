When considering the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your current financial situation, investment goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here’s a structured approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After taking advantage of your 401(k) match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawal in retirement if certain conditions are met, which can be beneficial depending on your anticipated tax bracket.

3. **401(k) Contributions:** If you can, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit after your IRA contributions. If your 401(k) has higher fees or limited investment options, you might balance it by putting more into your IRA or taxable accounts as well.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA), consider contributing to a taxable account. These accounts provide flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices but do not offer the same tax benefits.

5. **Consider Taxes:** Pay attention to the tax implications of each account type. For example, more of your high-growth investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while lower-growth investments can be placed in taxable accounts to mitigate taxes on capital gains.

6. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:** Adjust your allocations based on your financial goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.) and your investment horizon. Longer time frames may allow for more aggressive investments.

7. **Review Regularly:** Your financial situation and the economic landscape may change, so regularly review and adjust your contributions and asset allocation.

It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.

If you want to manage and track your investments more effectively, consider using financial management tools or apps that can assist in your planning. However, remember that the information above should not be considered personalized financial advice.
