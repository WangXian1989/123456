Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can allocate funds to a taxable investment account. This could be beneficial for liquidity and flexibility, as you can access funds without penalties.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives across all accounts.
- **Tax Implications**: Be aware of the tax implications for each type of account, especially when withdrawing funds from your taxable accounts.
- **Retirement Needs**: Consider your projected income needs in retirement and how each type of account will contribute to those needs.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach often involves maximizing employer-sponsored retirement plans first, then individual retirement accounts, and finally moving to taxable accounts. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
