Distributing your money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is essential for effective retirement planning and tax efficiency. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: This is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that often comes with tax benefits, such as pre-tax contributions, and sometimes employer matching. It's subject to contribution limits.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, and withdrawals in retirement are taxed. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement after contributing post-tax income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have tax advantages like retirement accounts, but they offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investment choices.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:  
   Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money" and should be a priority.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for tax-advantaged growth.  
   - Taxable accounts can hold investments that have favorable capital gains tax treatments, such as stocks held long-term or tax-efficient funds.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline:
   - **401(k)**: Invest in a mix of stocks and bonds according to your risk profile. Often, these accounts offer limited investment choices. 
   - **IRA**: Use this account for more aggressive investments or those with better growth potential.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in more tax-efficient products, like index funds or ETFs, that are less affected by capital gains distributions.

5. **Withdrawals and Tax Strategy**:
   Plan your withdrawals strategically. In retirement, consider a sequence of withdrawals that minimizes your overall tax burden:
   - Withdraw from taxable accounts first, in order to allow retirement accounts to grow tax-deferred longer. 
   - Tap into traditional IRAs next, as withdrawals are taxable.
   - Use Roth IRAs last, as they provide tax-free growth.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   Your financial situation and market conditions change over time. Regularly review your allocations and adjust as needed. 

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to customize this strategy based on your unique situation.

Always ensure you meet annual contribution limits and take advantage of any additional retirement accounts available to you.
