When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors to optimize your investment strategy:

### 1. **Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are typically pre-tax (traditional) or tax-free (Roth). Growth is tax-deferred in traditional accounts and tax-free in Roth accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments, and dividends are taxed as ordinary income.
   
### 2. **Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Consider holding assets in taxable accounts where you can easily access funds without penalties.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA to maximize growth potential through compounding.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Once you secure the match, direct additional funds into your IRA (especially if it's a Roth).
- **Taxable Account Contributions**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and immediate access.

### Suggested Distribution Example
- **401(k)**: 15% up to the employer match
- **IRA**: 10-15% annually based on contribution limits
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining funds or additional savings as needed 

By strategically distributing your assets across these account types, you can grow your wealth more efficiently while minimizing tax liabilities. Itâ€™s always wise to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific financial situation.
