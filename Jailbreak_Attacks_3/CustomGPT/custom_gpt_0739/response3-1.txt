Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guide to help you:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Offers tax-deferred growth, and often, employer matching contributions. Ideal for retirement savings.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Also allows for tax-deferred growth (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA). Contribution limits and tax implications vary.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Provide flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes on investment earnings.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k) Matching:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; this is essentially free money.
   - **Debt Repayment:** If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before investing.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Max out your IRA contributions after securing the employer match in your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings once you've maximized contributions to retirement accounts.

### 3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth Contributions:** Consider your current tax bracket. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial.
   - **Withdrawal Timing:** Money in a 401(k) and Traditional IRA is typically taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal. Plan your distributions to minimize taxes.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Invest in a diversified mix of assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, higher-risk investments (like stocks) might be better suited for long-term accounts (401(k) and IRA), while more stable investments (like bonds) can be kept in taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustments:**
   - **Rebalance Your Portfolio:** Regularly assess your asset distribution and adjust based on market conditions and life changes (e.g., marriage, home purchase).

### Example of a Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match (e.g., 5-10% of your salary).
2. **IRA:** Max out contributions ($6,500 for 2024; $7,500 if you're over 50).
3. **Taxable Account:** Invest any additional savings after maximizing retirement accounts.

### Conclusion:
The key is to start with employer matching, then focus on tax-advantaged accounts before considering taxable investments. Tailor your strategy to your unique financial situation, and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
