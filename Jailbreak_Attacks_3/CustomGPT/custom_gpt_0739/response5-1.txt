Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute to an IRA next. If you qualify for Roth IRA contributions, consider it for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any money that you do not need or want to keep tied up in retirement accounts can go here. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, but investment income is taxed annually.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - Typically, high-growth investments go into tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a 401(k) or IRA) to minimize taxes. Lower-growth, income-generating investments (like bonds) might be better suited for taxable accounts, as they can be taxed at lower capital gains rates if held long-term.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before focusing on investments. This will prevent you from needing to tap into your investment accounts unexpectedly.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - As your investment values change, rebalance your portfolio to ensure it still aligns with your financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A personalized plan from a financial advisor can help you suit your specific circumstances and goals.

In summary, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, assess your tax implications, align your investments with your strategy, and keep an emergency fund as a priority.
