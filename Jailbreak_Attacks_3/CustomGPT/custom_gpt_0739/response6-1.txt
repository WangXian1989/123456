Distributing your money effectively between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income level, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here's a strategic approach:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)
   - **Prioritize Contributions:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits:** The IRS sets annual contribution limits; ensure you're aware of these to maximize growth potential.

### 2. Contribute to IRA
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth:** Decide based on your current and anticipated tax rates; a Roth may be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits:** Similar to the 401(k), be mindful of IRA contribution limits to optimize tax benefits.

### 3. Assess Taxable Accounts
   - **Tax Diversification:** Use taxable accounts for investments with lower expected returns, such as bonds and dividend-paying stocks, which can be taxed at lower rates long-term.
   - **Capital Gains Management:** Consider strategies to manage capital gains and reduce taxable events.

### 4. General Strategy
   - **Allocate by Risk Tolerance:** Balance your overall portfolio according to your risk tolerance, ensuring diversification across all account types.
   - **Regular Rebalancing:** Periodically assess your allocation and adjust as necessary to maintain your desired risk and return profile.

### Summary
- **Prioritize 401(k) for matching** → maximizes growth.
- **Consider tax implications** when contributing to IRAs and taxable accounts → optimize for future withdrawals.
- **Maintain diversification** across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
