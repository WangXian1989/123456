The best approach to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money" and a great starting point for retirement savings.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), you can contribute pre-tax, which can reduce your current taxable income. Withdrawals will also be taxed in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, including gains. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These donâ€™t have tax advantages, but they provide flexibility. You can access funds without penalties and potentially benefit from lower capital gains tax rates on long-term holdings.

### 3. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals:**
   - Keep an emergency fund in a savings account or liquid investments. Money needed for short-term goals should typically stay in a taxable account to avoid penalties on early withdrawal from retirement accounts.

### 4. **Invest According to Time Horizon:**
   - Long-term investments (e.g., stocks) are generally suited for 401(k) and IRA accounts since they have a longer time frame and more tax advantages.
   - For shorter-term investments, consider bonds or cash equivalents in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure that your investment strategy balances risk across your accounts. Consider having a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account to manage risk effectively.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and to respond to changes in market conditions or personal circumstances.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full match, then max out if possible.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Max out contributions next.
- **Taxable Account:** Use any surplus funds for investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion:
In general, focus on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first, then utilize taxable accounts for flexibility. It can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
