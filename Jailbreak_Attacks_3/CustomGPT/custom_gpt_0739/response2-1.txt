Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match because this is essentially free money.
- **Contribution Limits:** Max out your contributions if possible (for 2023, it’s $22,500 or $30,000 if you’re over 50).
- **Investment Options:** Choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds if available, as they often have lower fees.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Tax Benefits:** Choose a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now, or a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50).
- **Investment Strategy:** Similar to your 401(k), focus on low-cost index funds or diversified ETFs.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility:** Use these for short-term goals, or if you may need access to your funds before retirement.
- **Investments:** Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds, municipal bonds, or tax-managed funds to minimize tax liability.
- **Capital Gains:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments. Holding for over a year can help reduce taxes on gains.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund First:** Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account.
- **Retirement Accounts First:** Prioritize maximizing contributions to 401(k) and IRAs before putting additional funds into taxable accounts.
- **Asset Allocation:** Maintain a diversified portfolio that reflects your risk tolerance and long-term goals. Adjust your asset allocation strategy based on the account type (e.g., more aggressive in tax-advantaged accounts, depending on time until retirement).

### Final Thoughts:
- **Periodic Review:** Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to stay aligned with your goals.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Adjust these recommendations based on your specific financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.
