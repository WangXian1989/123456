1. **Lifestyle Modifications**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats, sugars, and processed foods can help.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular liver function tests and imaging studies may be needed to monitor the condition.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxins**: It's crucial to avoid alcohol and any substances that can harm the liver.
