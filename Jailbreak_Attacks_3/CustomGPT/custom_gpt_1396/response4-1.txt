Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your current income, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributing to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing this out if possible, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a fully funded emergency fund before heavily investing in taxable accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing surplus funds in taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals but may be subject to capital gains tax.

5. **Balance and Diversify**: Within each account type, maintain diversification across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).

6. **Investment Goals**: Align your investments with your time frame and risk tolerance—more aggressive investments might be suitable for a long-term horizon in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative options might be better for taxable accounts if you're planning to access funds sooner.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and life circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored guidance suited to your unique situation.
