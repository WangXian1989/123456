Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and income limits. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: If possible, continue to maximize contributions to your 401(k) after funding your IRA. The 401(k) has higher contribution limits than IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for flexibility. This is beneficial if you expect to need access to funds before retirement or if you want to invest in assets that aren’t allowed in tax-advantaged accounts (like certain investments).

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind that capital gains and interest from taxable accounts can impact your annual tax liability. Consider investing in tax-efficient ETFs or municipal bonds to minimize taxes.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to reduce risk.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help you tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation.
