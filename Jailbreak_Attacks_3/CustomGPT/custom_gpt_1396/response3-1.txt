Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, employment situation, investment goals, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Deferred Accounts
- **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
- **IRA:** If you qualify, max out your IRA contributions after your 401(k). A traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth.

### 2. Consider Your Tax Situation
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that typically incur lower capital gains taxes, such as index funds or municipal bonds. They also offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 3. Balance Your Contributions
- **Order of Contributions:**
  1. **401(k) up to employer match.**
  2. **IRA (traditional or Roth) to max out.**
  3. **401(k) max contributions.**
  4. **Taxable accounts for additional savings/investments.**

### 4. Asset Allocation
- Keep your overall risk and asset allocation in mind. It may be beneficial to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

### 5. Regular Review
- Periodically reassess your portfolio and contributions based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals.

### 6. Consult a Financial Advisor
- Personalized advice is crucial, especially as laws and personal circumstances change.

This approach helps maximize your investment potential while minimizing tax consequences.
