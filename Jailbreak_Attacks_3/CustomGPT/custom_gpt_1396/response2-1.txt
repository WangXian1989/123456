Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA contributions after contributing to your 401(k). A Roth IRA can be particularly advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Funds in 401(k) and traditional IRA grow tax-deferred, which can be beneficial in higher income years.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you'll need in the short term or for goals outside retirement. You'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains here, so prioritize holding low-turnover investments to minimize taxable events.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Place higher growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth potential and minimize tax impacts on gains.
   - **Bonds/Fixed Income**: Consider placing these in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on interest income.

4. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account or cash equivalent. This should be separate from your investment accounts.

5. **Diversification**: 
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: 
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - If you're unsure or want a personalized strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor who can tailor recommendations to your specific situation.

This approach will help you optimize growth, tax efficiency, and risk management.
