The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money. Then, aim to max out your contributions if you can afford to.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, consider contributing to this account, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket and can benefit from the tax advantages.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for savings that you may need before retirement age or for investments that generate capital gains (which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income). Consider keeping investments that might have a higher turnover or generate dividends in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If you're investing for retirement and have a long time horizon, focus on your 401(k) and IRA as they offer tax-deferred growth. If you need liquidity or have shorter-term goals, you may want to allocate more to your taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - Ensure that your overall investment portfolio is diversified across all accounts. Aim for the right asset allocation—stocks, bonds, etc.—that aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Your financial situation may change—such as changes in income, job status, or market conditions—so it's important to review and adjust your allocations regularly.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you are unsure or need personalized advice, consulting with a financial advisor can help you make informed decisions based on your specific circumstances.

Balancing your investments among these accounts requires a strategic approach that considers both tax implications and your long-term financial objectives.
