To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Assess Contribution Limits and Benefits:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize employer matches; contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on income limits and tax implications.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for flexibility; can access funds without penalties, suitable for short-term goals.

### 2. Evaluate Your Tax Situation:
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Prioritize accounts that offer tax-deferred growth for long-term retirement savings (401(k) and traditional IRA).
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding stocks in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 3. Diversification and Risk Tolerance:
   - Use a mix of investments across accounts to manage risk effectively.
   - Adjust allocation based on your age, financial goals, and market volatility.

By applying these strategies and regularly reviewing your financial situation, you can optimize your investment distribution for growth and tax efficiency. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific needs.
