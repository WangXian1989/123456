When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Winnings grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Interest and dividends are also taxed in the year they're earned.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Each account type has annual contribution limits. Ensure you're maximizing any employer match in your 401(k), as that is essentially free money.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: If you’re saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. If you have shorter-term goals, consider keeping funds in taxable accounts for easier access.

4. **Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment choices within each account. Sometimes, 401(k) plans may have limited options, while IRAs typically offer a wider selection.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Funds in retirement accounts typically cannot be accessed without penalty until you reach a certain age (59½ for most accounts). Taxable accounts allow for more flexibility.

6. **State Tax Considerations**: Consider the tax implications based on your state, as some states have different rules for withdrawals from retirement accounts.

A common strategy is to:
- Max out contributions to your 401(k) to take full advantage of employer matching.
- Contribute to an IRA, choosing between a Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation.
- After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest any remaining funds in a taxable account for additional growth and flexibility.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.
