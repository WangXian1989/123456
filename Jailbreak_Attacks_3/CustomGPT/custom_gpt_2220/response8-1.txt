The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment knowledge, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is effectively free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out an IRA (Traditional or Roth) after taking full advantage of your 401(k) match. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** If you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider contributing to a taxable account. This is ideal if you need access to funds before retirement age or wish to invest outside retirement vehicles.

3. **Review Investment Options:**
   - 401(k) plans may have limited investment choices, so ensure you're comfortable with them. IRAs often provide a wider array of investment options.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Distribute your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Consider an age-based approach, gradually shifting to conservative investments as retirement age approaches.

5. **Future Tax Considerations:**
   - Be mindful of your expected tax situation in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket, a Roth account might be preferable. Conversely, if you anticipate a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) might be more beneficial.

6. **Long-Term Goals:**
   - Think about what you want to achieve in retirement. If early retirement or major expenses in the future are on your radar, consider liquid assets in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - Regularly review your investment strategy to adjust for changes in income, tax laws, and personal circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs and goals.
