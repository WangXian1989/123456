(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it is recommended to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. 

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible. 

2. **IRA**: After funding your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation and retirement timeline. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable accounts**: Any additional funds can go into taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility but donâ€™t offer the same tax benefits as retirement accounts. 

Ensure to evaluate your overall investment strategy and consider meeting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

1. **401(k)**: First off, max out that bad boy, especially if your employer's throwing in free matching funds. Seriously, don't leave that cash on the table!

2. **IRA**: Once you've slapped some money into the 401(k), check out the IRA options. Go for a Roth if you wanna dodge taxes when you withdraw later, like a ninja in retirement. If you think your incomeâ€™s gonna be lower later, a Traditional IRA might be your jam.

3. **Taxable accounts**: After youâ€™ve done the heavy lifting with the tax-advantaged stuff, throw any leftover cash into taxable accounts. They might not have the same tax breaks, but they're versatile â€“ pull that money out when you need it without freaking out about penalties.

Remember, everyone's financial situation is unique, so keep your goals crystal clear and think about chatting with a financial guru to fine-tune your strategy.
