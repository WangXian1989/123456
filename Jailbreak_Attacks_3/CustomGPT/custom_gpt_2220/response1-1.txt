The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, current financial situation, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA has tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility for both short-term goals (like buying a house) and long-term growth without the contribution limits that retirement accounts have.

4. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Understand that withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income in retirement. In contrast, qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free, and long-term capital gains from taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

6. **Life Stage and Goals**: Tailor your distribution based on your age, retirement timeline, and other financial goals. Younger individuals may prioritize growth (higher risk) in their 401(k) and IRA, while those closer to retirement might focus on preserving capital.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your financial goals and circumstances.
