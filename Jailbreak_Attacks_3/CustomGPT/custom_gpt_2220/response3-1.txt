Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, and retirement goals. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to receive the full match, as this is effectively free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. 
   - **IRA**: You can choose between a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) or a Roth IRA (post-tax contributions for tax-free withdrawals in retirement). 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer tax advantages, but you can withdraw from them without penalties before retirement age.

3. **Diversify Contributions**: 
   - After maximizing the employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA to take advantage of tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals, depending on the type of IRA.
   - Use taxable accounts for any additional investing. They provide flexibility as you can access funds anytime.

4. **Consider Retirement Timeline**: If you are closer to retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on withdrawals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how and when youâ€™ll withdraw from each account type in retirement, considering tax implications and your needs.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and tax laws can change, so reevaluate your distribution strategy regularly.

Consulting a financial advisor is also recommended to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances and goals.
