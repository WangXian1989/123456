Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're not already maxing out your contributions, aim to do so if it makes sense for your budget.
   - **IRA**: Similarly, if you qualify, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. This is particularly beneficial if you're in a lower tax bracket and can benefit from tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, but they will incur capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, diversify your investments to balance risk and reward. Consider stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) are subject to income tax, while withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free if qualified. Taxable accounts incur capital gains taxes when sold.

6. **Revisit Your Strategy Regularly**: Life changes and market conditions will affect your investment strategy. Review and adjust your allocations periodically.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
