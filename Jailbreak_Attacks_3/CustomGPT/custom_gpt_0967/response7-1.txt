Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free" money.
- **IRA**: Consider contributing the maximum to an IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts (like 401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
- **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, providing tax-free growth. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as you'll pay taxes only when you sell.

### 3. Consider Your Investment Timeline
- If youâ€™re investing for retirement, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals (e.g., buying a house), taxable accounts may provide more flexibility.

### 4. Diversification and Asset Allocation
- Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and within accounts. This ensures a balanced approach to risk and growth.

### 5. Regularly Review and Rebalance
- Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust contributions to maintain your desired investment strategy, especially as you approach retirement.

### Example Distribution Approach
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- Max out your IRA contributions.
- Invest any additional funds in taxable accounts, focusing on low-turnover investments to minimize taxes.

### Final Thoughts
It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual needs and goals. They're equipped to consider all aspects of your financial situation for optimal distribution.
