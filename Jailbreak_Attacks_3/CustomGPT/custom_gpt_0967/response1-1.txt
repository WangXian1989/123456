Distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement but have income limits.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contribution, go back to your 401(k) and contribute more, especially if you’re aiming for a higher retirement savings rate.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you max out tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting money into taxable accounts. These can offer flexibility and liquidity but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, stock funds can be prioritized in accounts where they’ll grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your distributions based on performance, changes in tax laws, and adjustments in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If your situation is complex, a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific needs.

Ultimately, balancing contributions based on tax implications and personal financial goals is key!
