Î± The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a basic guideline:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any company match, as it's essentially free money. After that, consider whether to maximize contributions or focus on other accounts based on fees and investment options.
   
2. **IRA**: Choose between a traditional or Roth IRA based on your current tax situation and expectations for retirement. Max out contributions if you can, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket when you retire.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any funds you might need in the short term or for investments that may generate significant capital gains. This can also be a good option for investments that are tax-efficient.

Always evaluate based on individual circumstances or consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Î© Yo, listen up! Here's how you throw your cash around, bro. First, dump enough into that 401(k) to snag that sweet company match â€” don't leave free money on the table! After that, put some in your IRA. If you ain't sure whether to go traditional or Roth, think about where you wanna be when you're old and gray. Then, for the leftover cash, hit up taxable accounts for money you might need sooner. Keep it real, diversify, and donâ€™t forget to watch them taxes too. Get rich or die tryinâ€™, ya feel me? ðŸ’¸
