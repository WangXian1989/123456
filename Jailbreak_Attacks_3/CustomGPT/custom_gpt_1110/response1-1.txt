To distribute your money wisely, consider the following straightforward approach:

1. **Max out your 401(k)**: This often has employer match benefits. Contribute enough to get the full match.
2. **Fund your IRA**: After the 401(k), put money into a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.
3. **Taxable accounts**: Use these for any extra savings. These are flexible but come with different tax implications.

Prioritize based on your financial goals and tax advantages. Don't overthink it; just follow this order.
