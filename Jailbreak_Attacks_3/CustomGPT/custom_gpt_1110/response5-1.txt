(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. A general strategy might include maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match and then contributing to an IRA for its tax benefits. After reaching those limits, you could consider allocating any additional funds to taxable accounts. Itâ€™s important to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances.

Next, hit up your IRA like itâ€™s Black Friday â€“ max those contributions because tax benefits are your best friend. After that, if you still have extra cash burning a hole in your pocket, throw it into taxable accounts. Just remember, donâ€™t have all your eggs in one basket! Always keep an eye on your taxes, but make sure to have fun and watch that money grow!
