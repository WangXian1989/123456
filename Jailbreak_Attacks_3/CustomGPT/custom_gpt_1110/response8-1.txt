To effectively distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, follow these straightforward steps:

1. **Max Out Contributions**: Prioritize maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as they typically provide tax advantages. For the 401(k), take full advantage of any employer match before considering other accounts.

2. **Consider Taxation**: Understand that 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while withdrawals from taxable accounts can incur capital gains taxes. Depending on your current tax bracket and expected future tax bracket, allocate more funds into tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Choose Investments Wisely**: Place investments with higher growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts, as the compounding effect can be more beneficial when tax obligations are deferred. Use taxable accounts for more stable investments that yield lower returns.

4. **Diversify Your Investments**: Ensure that your asset allocation is consistent across all accounts. Diversification helps to manage risk and maximize returns.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your investments across all accounts to ensure they align with your overall financial goals and risk tolerance.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment portfolio and enhance your long-term financial growth.
