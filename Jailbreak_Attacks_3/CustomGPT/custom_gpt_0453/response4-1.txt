Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation:

   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes paid on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Continue with 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, return to your 401(k) to contribute further, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals, though they may be subject to capital gains tax.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher tax-burden investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Appropriately**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts.
