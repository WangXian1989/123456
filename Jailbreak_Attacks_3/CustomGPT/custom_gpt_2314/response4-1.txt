Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar, with potential tax deductions based on income and eligibility.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Growth is subject to capital gains tax, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before investing heavily.

4. **Debt Considerations**: Pay down high-interest debt before allocating significant funds to investment accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Different accounts can hold different investment strategies—stocks, bonds, etc.—to manage risk.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: Prioritize retirement accounts for long-term savings, moving to taxable accounts for goals that are shorter-term.

7. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type to optimize your strategy.

8. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically and adjust as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your individual circumstances.
