Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is effectively "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions upfront.

### 2. **Assess Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account type. In 2024, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and for IRAs, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

### 3. **Diversification of Investments**
   - In your 401(k) and IRA, focus on a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Taxable accounts can also be diversified, but consider tax-efficient investment options to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Balance Tax Implications**
   - Keep in mind that money withdrawn from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs is taxed as ordinary income, whereas capital gains in taxable accounts may be taxed at a lower rate.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting strategies in taxable accounts to offset gains.

### 5. **Reevaluate Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your contributions and investment allocations based on changing goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

### Conclusion
Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts and consider a balanced approach to investments across all account types. Consulting with a financial advisor can further tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
