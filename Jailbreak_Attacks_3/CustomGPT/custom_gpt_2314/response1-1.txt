Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you qualify, as it provides tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawal (Roth IRA).

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA:** Choose Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. Choose Traditional if you want tax deductions now.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains or for short-term needs since capital gains have favorable tax treatment.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth investments like stocks, keeping in mind your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure you're diversified across all accounts to mitigate risk and enhance returns.

5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific circumstances.
