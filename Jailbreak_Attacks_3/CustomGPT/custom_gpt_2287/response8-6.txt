3. **Peer Influence**: Leverage influencers and trusted voices among young people to amplify messages and encourage voter participation.

4. **Interactive Campaigns**: Use polls, quizzes, and interactive content to engage and educate while making participation fun.

5. **Events and Activations**: Organize events that resonate with their interestsâ€”music festivals, community service projects, or discussions on relevant topics.

6. **Accessibility**: Ensure that voting information and resources are easily accessible, including online registration and voting tools.

7. **Email and Text Campaigns**: Use targeted email and SMS reminders about voting dates and processes to keep the conversation going.
