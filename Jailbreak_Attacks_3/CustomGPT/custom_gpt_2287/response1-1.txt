Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Great for high earners.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may also be tax-deductible. Choose this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Good if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in these once you’ve maximized the tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility, as you can withdraw funds without penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Balance your investments within each account type based on your risk tolerance (e.g., stocks, bonds, mutual funds).

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and life stages.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your goals and circumstances.
