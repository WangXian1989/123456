Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 

2. **Assess Your Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to meet the match, then consider maxing out your IRA contributions. As of 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA.

3. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow free from capital gains taxes.
   - Consider putting fixed-income investments (like bonds) in your taxable account, where they may be taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Diversify Across Accounts**:
   - Maintain a balanced investment strategy across all accounts to reduce risk and increase potential returns.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your overall financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexity of tax laws and investment strategies, working with a financial advisor can help tailor a plan to your specific needs.

By strategically dividing your contributions and investments among these accounts, you can optimize for growth while minimizing taxes.
