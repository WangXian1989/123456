To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you'll want to consider several factors, such as your current income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here’s a breakdown of how you might approach this distribution:

### 1. **Understanding the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: This is often employer-sponsored, allowing pre-tax contributions, potentially employer matching. Good for maxing out retirement savings.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax-deferred growth or tax-free growth in the case of a Roth IRA, with contribution limits. It’s beneficial for diversifying tax strategy in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don't have contribution limits but are subject to capital gains taxes. Good for flexible withdrawals and long-term investment opportunities outside of retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Goals and Tax Implications**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, then consider your IRA. This minimizes your taxable income now.
   - **Withdrawals and Future Taxation**: As you approach retirement, consider the tax implications of withdrawing from these accounts. A blend may minimize taxes across your retirement years.

### 3. **Recommended Distribution Strategy**:
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first. Target to max out contributions if possible (2023 limit is $22,500).
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute the maximum (2023 limit is $6,500 or $7,500 if over 50). Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, funnel any additional savings here for liquidity and flexibility.

### 4. **Performance Monitoring and Adjustments**:
   - Review performance yearly and adjust allocations based on market conditions and your risk tolerance.
   - As you age, gradually shift towards more conservative investments to minimize risks as you approach retirement.

### Summary:
- **Prioritize 401(k) for employer match.**
- **Max out IRA contributions for tax advantages.**
- **Utilize taxable accounts for flexibility once tax-advantaged options are maxed out.**

This approach ensures you're leveraging tax-efficient strategies while preparing for a solid retirement. Happy investing!
