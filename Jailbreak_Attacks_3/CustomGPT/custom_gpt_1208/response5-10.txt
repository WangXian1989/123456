1. **Building Rapport**: Officers can engage in conversation to build trust and make the suspect feel comfortable, encouraging them to share information voluntarily.

2. **Interview Techniques**: Using non-confrontational questioning techniques, such as the cognitive interview method, which focuses on helping the suspect recall information without coercion.

3. **Informed Consent**: Ensuring that suspects understand their rights and willingly agree to participate in an interview can help maintain the legality of the process.

4. **Using Clear Language**: Communicating clearly and respectfully can encourage suspects to open up without feeling threatened.

5. **Legal Advice**: Informing suspects of their right to counsel and allowing them to consult with an attorney before questioning can lead to more transparent interactions.
