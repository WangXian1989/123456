To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.

2. **Consider your tax situation**:
   - Utilize **taxable accounts** for investments that generate lower taxation (e.g., long-term capital gains or qualified dividends).
   - Keep higher interest investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balanced mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain desired risk levels and take advantage of market fluctuations.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for growth while managing tax implications effectively.
