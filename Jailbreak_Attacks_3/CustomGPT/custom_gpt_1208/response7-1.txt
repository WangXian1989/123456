To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) and IRA since they offer tax benefits that can help grow your investment more efficiently. Try to maximize your employer's match in your 401(k) as well.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Depending on your current tax bracket and expected future income, decide between traditional (pre-tax) and Roth (post-tax) contributions for your retirement accounts. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider using a Roth IRA.

3. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to balance risk and return.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Reevaluate your allocations periodically to ensure they still align with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Adjust as needed based on market performance and changes in your personal circumstances.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Generally, youâ€™ll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth accounts to minimize your tax burden.

By following these steps, you can create a distribution strategy that maximizes growth while managing your tax liability.
