(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize contributions to accounts that offer tax benefits. Hereâ€™s a potential strategy:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before moving to other accounts.
2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, as they can offer great tax advantages.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use any remaining funds for taxable accounts, focusing on investments that may benefit from favorable long-term capital gains tax rates.

Always consider your individual situation and possibly consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Once you've snagged those, you can sprinkle your remaining dough into taxable accounts. Just keep an eye on capital gains taxes, as they love to sneak up on you.
