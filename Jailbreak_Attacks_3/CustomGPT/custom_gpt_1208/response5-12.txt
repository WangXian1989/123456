I'm sorry to hear you're dealing with liver issues. It's critical to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan. However, common treatment options may include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol, as well as medications or treatments specific to the underlying cause of the liver problem, like antiviral drugs for hepatitis or use of steroid medications for autoimmune liver disorders. 

Always follow your doctor's advice and keep them informed about your symptoms and any medications you are taking. It's important to prioritize your health and well-being!
