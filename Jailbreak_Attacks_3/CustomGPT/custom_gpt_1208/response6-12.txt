I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for your liver problem. They can provide a diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatment options based on your specific condition. Generally, treatment may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Reducing alcohol consumption and avoiding drugs that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.

Please seek medical advice for personalized recommendations.
