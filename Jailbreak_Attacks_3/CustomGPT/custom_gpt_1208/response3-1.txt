The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to help you optimize your distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement but require after-tax contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt (like credit cards), it may be wise to pay that down before heavily investing in these accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before committing large sums to retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Allocate funds across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk.

6. **Assess Retirement Timeline**: If you're closer to retirement, you may want to shift more toward stable investments in your 401(k) and IRA rather than high-risk options.

7. **Annual Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a well-rounded investment strategy that aligns with your financial objectives. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
