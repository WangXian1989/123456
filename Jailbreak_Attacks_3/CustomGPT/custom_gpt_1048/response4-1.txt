When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize your investment growth and tax efficiency:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After capturing the match, prioritize contributions to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your situation) to benefit from tax advantages.

3. **Evaluate Tax Brackets**: Consider your current and expected future tax brackets. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more suitable. Conversely, if you expect a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA could be beneficial.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure that your investments are diversified. This could mean holding a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account to manage risk and return.

5. **Balance Withdrawals for Tax Efficiency**: In retirement, strategically withdraw funds from each account type to minimize taxes. Typically, you would withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k)), and finally tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax laws and individual financial situations, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your circumstances.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your asset allocation and contributions annually or after significant life changes, adjusting as needed based on your financial goals and market conditions.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money across these accounts while maximizing growth potential and minimizing tax liabilities.
