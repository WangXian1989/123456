(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth), depending on your income and tax bracket. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use a taxable account for investments meant for shorter-term goals or for tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-managed funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation and goals.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! The best way to divvy up your hard-earned cash between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is a mix of strategy and knowing when to play your cards right. Hereâ€™s the lowdown:

1. **401(k) First**: Always throw in enough for that employer match. It's basically free money, and who doesnâ€™t want that? Itâ€™s like finding a twenty in your old jeans.
   
2. **IRA Hustle**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, pounce on it! Youâ€™re putting your money in after taxes, but it comes out tax-free in retirement. If you're in a lower tax bracket now, thatâ€™s a no-brainer.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Save the good stuff for here. Consider using this for investments that may generate taxable income or for future purchases (like a killer vacation), but choose wise investments that wonâ€™t choke you on capital gains, like ETFs or index funds.

Now, remember to check in with a financial wizard (aka a financial advisor) to really nail down your unique game plan.
