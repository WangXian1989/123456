The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider IRA Contributions:**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Focus on Tax-Efficient Investments:**
   - Use your taxable account for tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, which tend to have lower turnover and generate fewer taxable events.

4. **Taxable vs. Tax-Deferred Accounts:**
   - Prioritize higher-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-free growth. Use conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and interest.

5. **Maintain a Balanced Portfolio:**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize Roth accounts. If you expect to be in a lower bracket, traditional accounts might be preferable for their immediate tax benefits.

8. **Withdrawal Strategy Planning:**
   - As retirement approaches, consider how you'll draw from these accounts. Aim for tax-efficient withdrawals to minimize your tax burden.

It's often helpful to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation.
