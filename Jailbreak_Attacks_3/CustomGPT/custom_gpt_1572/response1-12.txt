I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help manage weight and improve liver health.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Avoid or limit alcohol consumption.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Medications**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids**: For autoimmune liver diseases.
   - **Other medications**: To treat specific liver issues, like fatty liver disease.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplantation might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment options tailored to your specific situation.
