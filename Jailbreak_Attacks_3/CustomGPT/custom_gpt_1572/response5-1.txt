To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation) if you qualify for contributions.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) until you hit the annual limit if you have additional funds available. This reduces your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, use any remaining funds for taxable accounts. These provide flexibility and can be useful for short-term goals while offering potential tax advantages on capital gains.

5. **Balance Withdrawal Strategy**: When it comes time to withdraw, prioritize taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to maximize tax efficiency.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your unique situation.
