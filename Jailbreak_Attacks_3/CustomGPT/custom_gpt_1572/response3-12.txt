I'm not a doctor, but I can provide general information on liver health. Treatment options can vary based on the specific liver condition. Common approaches include:

1. **Dietary Changes**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), your doctor may prescribe antiviral or anti-inflammatory medications.

3. **Lifestyle Modifications**: Regular exercise and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and health.

5. **Surgery or Procedures**: In severe cases, options like liver transplant or procedures to remove blockages may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
