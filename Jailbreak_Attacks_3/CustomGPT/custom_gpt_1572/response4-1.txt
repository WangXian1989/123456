To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match; this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) if you have a match. Aim for the annual limit.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that produce less taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds) in all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically, especially after significant market movements, to ensure they align with your goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in liquid accounts before heavily investing.
