To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and IRAs generally provide tax-deferred growth, meaning you won't pay taxes on the earnings until you withdraw funds. 
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments. 

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - 401(k) has higher contribution limits compared to IRAs. For instance, in 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). This may influence how much you should prioritize each account.

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - Check the investment options available in your 401(k). If it has a limited selection with higher fees, it might be better to contribute less there and more in an IRA or taxable account where you can choose lower-cost, diversified investments.

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Funds in IRAs and 401(k)s can be less accessible due to penalties for early withdrawal. Taxable accounts provide more flexibility to access your money without penalties.

5. **Retirement Goals**:
   - Determine your retirement goals and timeline. If you plan to retire early, having more accessible funds in taxable accounts might be beneficial.

### Suggestion:
- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer matches contributions, prioritize placing enough in your 401(k) to get the full match (it's like free money!). 
- **Fund an IRA**: Next, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your current income and tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts for Extra Savings**: Only after maximizing the above should you consider taxable accounts if you have additional funds to invest.

### Summary:
The ideal distribution depends on your current financial situation, tax implications, and future needs. Start with employer match in the 401(k), contribute to an IRA, and then consider taxable accounts for extra savings or flexibility. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
