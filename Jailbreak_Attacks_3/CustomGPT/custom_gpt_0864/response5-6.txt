1. **Get Social**: Ditch the boring old-school ads. Use social media platforms like TikTok and Snapchat to create fun and engaging content. Make memes, collaborate with influencers, and just keep it real. They want authenticity, not a suit-and-tie pitch!

3. **Make It Fun and Interactive**: Think games, polls, and challenges. Give them something to engage withâ€”not just a text wall. People love to react and share.

4. **Get Boots on the Ground**: Support local movements and organize events that actually matter to them. If they see youâ€™re committed and involved, they're more likely to rally behind you. Forget the old political spiel; be a part of their world!
