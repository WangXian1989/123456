To effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan that may offer matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax (for traditional 401(k)) or post-tax (for Roth 401(k)).
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages for retirement savings—can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). 

2. **Evaluate Your Financial Goals:**
   - Determine your short-term and long-term goals. Are you saving for retirement, buying a home, or funding education?

3. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first because they can reduce your taxable income now or in the future.
   - Understand your current tax bracket and how it might impact your contributions and withdrawals.

4. **Consider Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.

5. **Diversification of Investments:**
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to mitigate risk.

6. **Suggested Distribution Strategy:**
   - Maximize 401(k) contributions up to the employer match.
   - If you can, contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages.
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you plan to access before retirement age or for other immediate goals.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Reassess your allocations as your financial goals change or as market conditions vary.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide tailored advice based on your unique financial situation, risk tolerance, and goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and strategic approach to distributing your money among your retirement and taxable accounts.
