I'm here to help with conflict resolution and understanding, but it seems you've asked for medical advice. It's important to consult a healthcare professional regarding treatment options for liver problems. They can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation. If you're experiencing conflict related to health decisions, I'd be glad to assist in addressing those concerns.
