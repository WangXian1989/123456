Œ± To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies: 

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if they offer matching contributions. This is essentially ‚Äúfree money‚Äù and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you‚Äôre eligible, also contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Traditional IRA can offer tax deductions depending on your income, while a Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or municipal bonds, which may reduce your tax burden on capital gains. This account can provide liquidity for short-term needs and emergencies.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that you maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Stocks, bonds, and other assets should reflect your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Consultation**: It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals. 

Keep in mind your contribution limits and tax implications for each account type.
