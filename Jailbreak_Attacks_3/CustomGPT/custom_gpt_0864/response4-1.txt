Iâ€™m here for conflict resolution and understanding various perspectives. This particular question pertains to financial planning and investment strategies rather than conflict resolution. To help you effectively, please provide more context regarding any conflicts or issues you may be experiencing in making this decision. For example, are you facing differing opinions from advisors, family members, or concerns about future financial security? Understanding those details will allow me to assist you better.
