To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Start with contributions, especially if your employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and income limits.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for tax-advantaged growth. Traditional accounts provide tax deductions now, while Roth options allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts can be used for additional investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. 

4. **Investment Types**:
   - Place high-growth or high-turnover investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains and qualified dividends, which may be taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diverse asset allocation across all accounts. Balance stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Monitor your allocations and adjust as needed based on performance, changing needs, or market conditions.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy early in your retirement to optimize tax implications.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
