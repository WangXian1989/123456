Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you’re eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments beyond your retirement accounts. This can provide flexibility for short-term goals or emergencies.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Adjust your investment strategy based on account type:
   - **401(k)**: Consider a diversified portfolio with a mix of stocks, bonds, and target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your retirement timeline, aim for more aggressive or moderate investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like ETFs, index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Taxes**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. For instance, long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation!
