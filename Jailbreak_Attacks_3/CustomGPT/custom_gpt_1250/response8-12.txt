I'm really sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice based on your specific condition. However, common treatment options may include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, medications to manage symptoms, and in some cases, more advanced treatments like surgery or liver transplantation. Always seek medical advice for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
