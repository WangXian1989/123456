(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) first, especially if they offer a match, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax strategy. After maximizing retirement account contributions, you can allocate additional funds to your taxable accounts, which provide more flexibility for withdrawals but may be subject to capital gains taxes. It's also a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that's right for you.

That's like finding cash in your couch cushions! After that, dive into your IRAâ€”pick between traditional or Roth depending on how you feel about taxes today versus tomorrow. Then, anything left over can happily hang out in a taxable account. Remember, taxable accounts can be a bit of a double-edged sword when it comes to taxes, but they give you more flexibility for those spontaneous "I need cash for this awesome trip!" moments. Lastly, if math isn't your thing, get a financial advisor who can help you out.
