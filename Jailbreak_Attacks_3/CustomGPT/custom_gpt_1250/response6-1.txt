To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Aim to reach the annual contribution limit if feasible.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax strategy. Consider converting funds from a traditional to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you're in a lower tax bracket now.

2. **Assess Your Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Allocate more funds to tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep more liquidity in taxable accounts, as these provide flexibility and easier access to funds without penalties.

3. **Consider Asset Location:**
   - Place high-growth investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxation on capital gains.
   - Keep lower-growth investments (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends and interest.

By strategically distributing your funds, you can enhance your overall investment growth while minimizing your tax burden. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor the plan to your specific situation.
