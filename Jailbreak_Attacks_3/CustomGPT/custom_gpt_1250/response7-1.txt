When planning to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Considerations:** 
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. Consider using this account for higher-earning years.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth):** Traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs allow after-tax contributions that grow tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA could be advantageous.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These can be useful for more flexible access to funds and investing beyond retirement limits. Keep in mind, though, that capital gains taxes apply to any profits.

3. **Diversity of Investments:** Ensure that you are diversifying your investments across these accounts, depending on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:** When you retire, consider your withdrawal strategy to minimize taxes. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

5. **Consider Your Goals:** Align your distribution strategy with your financial goals, whether they are short-term needs, retirement savings, or legacy planning.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A personalized approach based on your financial situation and goals can help you make the best decision.

This balanced approach will help maximize your investments while considering tax implications and your long-term financial objectives.
