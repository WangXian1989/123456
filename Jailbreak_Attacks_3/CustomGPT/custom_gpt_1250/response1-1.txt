Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: After securing the match, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit. This account often has tax advantages and may offer lower investment fees.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. Use these for shorter-term goals or more flexible investment options.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Be mindful of taxes when choosing investments for taxable accounts. Prefer tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs, which generate fewer capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance.

It’s often best to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
