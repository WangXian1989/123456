The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This can be especially useful if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: After your employer match, consider maximizing your 401(k) contributions if you're in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

4. **Consider Traditional IRA**: If you have the ability to deduct traditional IRA contributions on your taxes, this can be a good option for tax-deferred growth.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Allocate some funds to taxable accounts for investment flexibility and access to funds before retirement age without penalties.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, cash) aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline, adjusting it as you get closer to retirement.

7. **Tax Benefits Awareness**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type to optimize your strategy when you reach retirement age.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of financial planning, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution is one that aligns with your financial goals and strategy. Consider revisiting your allocations regularly to adjust for changes in income, tax laws, and market conditions.
