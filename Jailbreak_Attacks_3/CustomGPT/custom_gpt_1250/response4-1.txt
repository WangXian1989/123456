Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider fully funding your IRA (either Traditional or Roth) if you're eligible, since they offer tax advantages.

2. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals:**
   - Keep enough liquidity in taxable accounts for emergency funds or short-term goals (3-6 months of expenses).

3. **Long-Term Growth:**
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term investments, which can benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth (in the case of Roth accounts).

4. **Tax Diversification:**
   - Aim for a mix of tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) and tax-free accounts (Roth IRA) to create flexibility in retirement.

5. **Investment Allocation:**
   - Consider your investment strategy and diversify within each account according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

6. **Periodic Review:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure you stay aligned with your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Professional:**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

It's crucial to tailor these strategies to your individual situation, as personal finance is not one-size-fits-all.
