Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts wisely can optimize tax efficiency and growth potential. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Contribute the maximum allowed to take advantage of tax benefits. 

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Avoid high-turnover investments in taxable accounts** to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversify Asset Types**
   - Hold **bonds and fixed income** in tax-deferred accounts (401(k)/IRA) where they wonâ€™t incur taxes until withdrawal.
   - Place **stocks, ETFs, or mutual funds** in taxable accounts for potential tax advantages on long-term gains.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Age and Retirement Goals**
   - Younger investors can focus more on growth (stocks) in taxable accounts.
   - As you approach retirement, consider reallocating to reduce risk and increase dividends.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Monitor the performance and tax implications of each account annually to adjust your strategy as needed.

This balanced approach helps maximize growth while managing tax liabilities effectively.
