Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, focus on contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing this out if your employer matches. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After your 401(k), fund an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use after-tax funds for:
   - Short-term savings goals (if you might need the money soon).
   - Investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, as these are usually taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Diversification and Risk**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance. Consider the type of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on each accountâ€™s tax implications.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changing goals, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

By following these steps, you can create a well-rounded distribution strategy that supports your long-term financial health.
