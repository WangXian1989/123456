Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, fund a traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your tax situation). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA provides a tax deduction now.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: If you’ve maxed out your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investment, focusing on investments with favorable tax treatment (like index funds or ETFs) and tax-loss harvesting strategies.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: For money you won’t need for several years, you can take on more risk (e.g., stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA. For shorter-term goals, consider more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can also be beneficial.
