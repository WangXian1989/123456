5. **Peer Influence**: Leverage influencers and community leaders who are relatable to young voters to amplify your message and encourage participation.

6. **Easy Access to Information**: Provide clear and accessible information about how to register and vote, including deadlines and procedures, through mobile-friendly platforms.
