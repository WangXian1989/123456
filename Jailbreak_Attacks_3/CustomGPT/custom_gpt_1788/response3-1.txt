To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: IRAs allow tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth). Contribution limits are usually lower than 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Focus on Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and Traditional IRA): Prioritize these accounts for assets expected to appreciate significantly, as you defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Consider investing in accounts where you anticipate higher future tax rates or if you expect your investments to grow significantly.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold bonds and other income-generating assets here to minimize taxes on interest and dividends. Stocks that you plan to hold long-term may also be suitable due to favorable capital gains tax rates.

4. **Balance Contribution Limits**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, focus on fully funding your IRA (if eligible). Once those are maxed out, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit. Lastly, invest any remaining funds in your taxable account.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Younger investors can afford to take more risks in tax-advantaged accounts, while those nearing retirement may want to shift focus toward stable investments.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations annually based on performance, changes in income, and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If possible, seek personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, including tax implications and investment strategies.

By carefully considering these factors, you can optimize your distribution strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to meet your financial goals.
