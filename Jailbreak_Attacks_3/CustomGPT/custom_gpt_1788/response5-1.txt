Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k):** Maximize employer matching contributions first. This is essentially free money. Consider contributing up to the maximum limit if you can afford it, as it may reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments that may be subject to lower tax rates (like long-term capital gains) or for savings goals with shorter time horizons. This is also a good place for cash reserves or more liquid assets.

**Allocation Strategy:**
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for retirement (401(k), IRA).
- Allocate any excess funds to your taxable accounts.
- Regularly reassess asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, age, and retirement timeline.

Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice, as individual circumstances can significantly affect the best strategy for you.
