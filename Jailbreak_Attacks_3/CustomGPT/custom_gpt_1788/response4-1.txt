Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit—it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you can use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, which can be advantageous based on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings after maxing out retirement accounts. These can provide flexibility for short-term goals or emergencies.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, more aggressive investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Invest tax-efficient assets (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes, and consider placing higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when to withdraw from these accounts in retirement to optimize taxes. 

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor your strategy to your specific situation.
