Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several considerations:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing taxable income now. Consider maxing out contributions if your employer matches.
   - **IRA**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider placing investments that generate high returns (but also high taxes) here.

### 2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Retirement Focus**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments, as you may need access to these funds sooner.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the limits are generally $22,500 for 401(k)s (with a $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (with a $1,000 catch-up for those over 50).

### 5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Regularly assess and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in income, and retirement goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation.
