The best strategy for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, and the growth is tax-deferred. Consider maximizing contributions here first to reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current tax bracket and whether you anticipate being in a higher or lower bracket in retirement when choosing between them.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts.

4. **Investment Horizon**: If you're investing for the long term (e.g., retirement), you might take a more aggressive approach in tax-advantaged accounts and a more conservative stance in taxable accounts due to potential capital gains taxes.

5. **Taxable Investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. 

7. **Roth Conversions**: If you're in a lower tax bracket now, consider converting some traditional retirement savings to a Roth IRA to take advantage of lower tax rates.

8. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.
