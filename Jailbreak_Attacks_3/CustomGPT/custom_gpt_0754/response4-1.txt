When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which can lower your current taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax benefits to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains may be taxed as capital gains, which might be lower than ordinary income tax rates.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Maximize employer matches in your 401(k) firstâ€”this is essentially "free money."
   - Consider maxing out IRAs next, especially if you qualify for Roth IRAs.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Longer investment horizons (for retirement) can favor tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - More immediate financial goals may be better suited for taxable accounts.

4. **Flexibility Needs**:
   - Consider how soon you might need access to the funds. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Use different account types to achieve a balanced and diversified portfolio, which can help manage tax liabilities over time.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max out employer match in 401(k)**.
2. **Contribute to IRAs**, prioritizing Roth if eligible.
3. **Fill up remaining allowances in the 401(k)**.
4. **Invest surplus funds in taxable accounts** for flexibility and potential tax advantages on long-term gains.

### Regular Review:
Regularly assess your investment allocations across these accounts, as your financial situation and market conditions can change.
