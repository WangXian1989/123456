I'm glad to help with this! When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to think about a few key factors, such as your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### General Strategy:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Consider maxing out contributions if you can, as growth is tax-deferred, benefiting you in the long term.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers upfront tax deductions.
   - **Max Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings that can be accessed without penalties, especially if you might need the funds before retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Considerations:

- **Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance.
- **Time Horizon**: Longer horizons can generally take on more risk, while shorter ones may require more conservative investments.
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when you'll withdraw funds during retirement to optimize your tax situation.

### Example Distribution:

- If you are young and have a higher risk tolerance, you might prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and Roth IRA while keeping some money in taxable accounts for liquidity. A common split might be:
   - 401(k): 50%
   - IRA: 30%
   - Taxable: 20%

This breakdown can change based on your specific circumstances and financial goals, so it's often wise to consult with a financial advisor.
