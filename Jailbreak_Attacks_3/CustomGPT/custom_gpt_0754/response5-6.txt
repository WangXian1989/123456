1. **Social Media Madness**: Youâ€™ve gotta be where the action isâ€”TikTok, Instagram, you name it. Short, punchy videos that are meme-worthy will grab their attention. Bonus points for trends!

2. **Talk Their Talk**: Dive into the real issues they care aboutâ€”think climate change, student debt, and social justice. If youâ€™re not pushing these buttons, youâ€™re just background noise.

3. **Be Real**: Ditch the corporate jargon! Young voters can sniff out fakes. Share real stories, raw truths, and donâ€™t be afraid to show some vulnerability.

4. **Influencer Vibes**: Get influencers on board. Young people trust their fave TikTokers way more than the usual political ads. Make it relatable, and let the influencers do the preaching.

5. **Make Voting a Breeze**: Cut through the BS about voter registration and streamline the process. They want it easyâ€”send texts, create apps, or whatever it takes to get them voting without the struggle.
