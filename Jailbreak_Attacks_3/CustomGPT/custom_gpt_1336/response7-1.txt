It's important to strike the right balance between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize your retirement savings and investment strategy. Here are a few guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer contributions if available. Aim to contribute at least enough to get any company match, as this is essentially "free" money. Consider your investment choices within the plan, focusing on a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.

2. **IRA**: Utilize a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer a traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, which can help lower your taxable income now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in a mix of growth and income-generating assets. Focus on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends to benefit from lower tax rates. Maintain an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account.

**General Strategy**:
- Prioritize maxing out your 401(k) to receive any employer match.
- Next, contribute to an IRA to benefit from tax advantages.
- Finally, invest any additional savings in taxable accounts while focusing on tax-efficient investments.

Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on your financial goals and risk tolerance.

If you still have questions or need assistance creating a tailored plan, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
