The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to maximize that match. It’s essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA might be more beneficial.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here can be taxed on capital gains when sold, and dividends are also taxable, so consider holding lower-turnover investments to minimize taxes.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other asset classes according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Rebalance and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level. Consider how much risk you're willing to take on given your proximity to retirement.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given that everyone's financial situation is unique, working with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

Overall, a balanced approach that takes advantage of tax benefits, employer contributions, and diversification will help you optimize your savings across these accounts.
