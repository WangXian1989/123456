The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Roth Options**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (if eligible), as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Tax Diversification**: Use a mix of tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) and after-tax accounts (Roth IRA, taxable accounts) to help manage tax implications in retirement.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a savings account before tying up too much in investment accounts.

5. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that off before investing.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Base your allocation on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Younger investors might lean more heavily into equities, while those closer to retirement may want more fixed income.

7. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Consider using taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access sooner than retirement funds, as 401(k) and IRA withdrawals can be penalized if taken before a certain age.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your unique situation and long-term goals.
