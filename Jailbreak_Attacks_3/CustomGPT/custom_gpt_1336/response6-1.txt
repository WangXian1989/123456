When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some key strategies to optimize your allocation:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money". Consider maxing out contributions if you can.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) contributions to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth, depending on the type of IRA.

2. **Balance with Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Taxable Investment Accounts**: Use these for flexibility and liquidity. They can be beneficial for short-term goals or supplementary income for retirement once you've maxed out tax-advantaged options.

3. **Considerations for Asset Allocation**:
   - **Investment Types**: Own more tax-inefficient investments, like bonds, and real estate in tax-advantaged accounts. Invest in tax-efficient options (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burden.
   - **Time Horizon**: Adjust investments based on your time horizon. Longer time horizons can typically tolerate more risk (e.g., stocks), whereas shorter-term goals may warrant more conservative investments (e.g., bonds).

By strategically distributing your funds across these accounts while being mindful of tax implications and your financial objectives, you can enhance your growth potential and tax efficiency. If your situation is complex, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
