First off, you definitely want to hit up a healthcare provider who knows their stuff because treating liver problems isnâ€™t a DIY project. Generally, though, you'd be looking at making some serious lifestyle shiftsâ€”think low-fat, high-fiber diets, and saying "bye-bye" to alcohol like itâ€™s a bad ex. Maybe even add some supplements to the mix if your doc approves, like milk thistle or artichoke extractâ€”they're known to help. In some cases, medication can help out if there's an infection or inflammation. And if things get super serious? Well, you might need to talk about a transplant.
