The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits (e.g., for 2023, it's $22,500 for employees under 50 and $30,000 for those 50 and older).
   - **Investment Options**: Review the investment options available in your 401(k), as they may vary significantly from one plan to another.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide between a Traditional IRA, which may provide tax deductions on contributions, or a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The contribution limits are lower than that of a 401(k) (e.g., $6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you’re age 50 or older).
   - **Tax Considerations**: Consider your current and expected future tax rates when choosing between account types.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties. They can be beneficial for short-term savings or investments you may need to access before retirement.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of taxes on capital gains and dividends. Investing in tax-efficient funds can help minimize tax burdens.
   
4. **Diversifying Investments**:
   - Make sure to diversify your investments among accounts to balance risk and tax implications across different investment types (stocks, bonds, mutual funds).
   - Consider asset location strategies—place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like a Roth IRA) and bonds in taxable accounts to optimize taxes.

5. **Personal Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Assess your financial goals (retirement, buying a home, education) and timelines, which will influence how you allocate your investment portions across the different accounts.

6. **Periodic Review and Adjustment**:
   - Regularly review your investment allocations and financial situation. Adjust your contributions and rebalancing according to market changes and personal financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and objectives.
