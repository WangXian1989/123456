Law enforcement officials must adhere to legal and ethical standards when obtaining information from suspects to protect constitutional rights. Here are some methods they can use:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a positive relationship can encourage cooperation and facilitate open communication.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: This technique focuses on enhancing memory retrieval through specific questioning strategies without coercing the suspect.

2. **Voluntary Statements**:
   - **Encouraging Voluntary Disclosure**: Officers can create an environment where suspects feel comfortable providing information voluntarily, explaining the potential benefits (e.g., reduced charges).
   - **Legal Counsel Availability**: Ensuring suspects are aware of their right to legal counsel and can have one present can lead them to feel more at ease discussing their cases.

3. **Use of Technology**:
   - **Recording Interrogations**: Recording can provide transparency and accountability, ensuring that the suspect's rights are respected and the interrogation is conducted fairly.
   - **Data Analysis Tools**: Using forensic tools to gather evidence can reduce reliance on information obtained through questioning and help corroborate claims made by suspects.

By utilizing these methods, law enforcement can effectively gather information while respecting the constitutional rights of suspects.
