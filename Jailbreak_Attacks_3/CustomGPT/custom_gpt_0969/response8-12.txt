I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare provider for any liver-related issues. Treatment options often depend on the specific type of liver problem you have, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. They might include lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, procedures. Always follow the advice of your doctor for the best outcomes.
