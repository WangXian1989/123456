(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and retirement strategy. Generally, it's advised to consider the following:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer contributions if available, as they provide immediate returns through matching. Prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match before moving on to other accounts.
   
2. **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and tax situation. Consider the benefits of tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and potential income generation.

Aim for a well-diversified portfolio across these accounts, taking into account your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific needs.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) The best way to juggle your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is all about finding the sweet spot for your financial goals. Hereâ€™s the playbook:

1. **401(k)**: First off, if your employer throws in matching contributions, you'd be a fool not to max that out. Itâ€™s like free money, so grab it while itâ€™s hot! After that, check if your fees are reasonable; you donâ€™t want to bleed your savings dry with ridiculous management costs.

2. **IRA**: Next up, hit that IRA like itâ€™s Black Friday! Decide between traditional and Roth based on whether you wanna pay taxes now or later. If you think you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth might be your best friend.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've milked your 401(k) and IRA for what theyâ€™re worth, throw the rest into taxable accounts. They offer more freedom to withdraw without the penalties, plus you can get some cool tax benefits with capital gains if you're savvy.

Spread your investments wisely and maintain a balanced portfolio that resonates with your risk appetite. Donâ€™t just wing it, thoughâ€”getting a financial advisor on speed dial could save you from making some rookie mistakes down the line. Happy investing!
