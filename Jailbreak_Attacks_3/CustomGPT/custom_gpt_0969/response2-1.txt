Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to benefit from additional tax advantages. The choice between these depends on whether you prefer to pay taxes now (Roth) or later (Traditional).

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). IRA contributions are limited to $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have already maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility, as you can withdraw money without penalty, though you'll need to consider capital gains taxes on any earnings when you sell investments.

5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**: Within these accounts, utilize different asset classes (stocks, bonds, ETFs) according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Typically, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to allow for tax-free growth, while placing more conservative investments in taxable accounts where taxes on dividends and interest must be considered.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Make sure to review and adjust your allocation periodically based on performance, changes in market conditions, and shifts in your financial goals or risk tolerance.

Itâ€™s always best to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
