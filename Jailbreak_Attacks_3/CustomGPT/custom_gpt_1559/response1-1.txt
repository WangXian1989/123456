The best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to accounts that offer tax advantages. After you get the match, consider maxing out your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility) before contributing more to your 401(k).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 401(k)s and IRAs provide tax advantages for retirement savings, while taxable accounts do not. Taxable accounts can provide more flexibility for withdrawals, but earnings may be taxed annually.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Make sure your investments within these accounts are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risks.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**: Younger investors might lean more towards growth-oriented investments in these accounts, while those closer to retirement may focus on preserving capital.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring your strategy to your specific financial situation and goals, including calculating your expected tax rates in retirement, can be complex. A financial advisor can help you create a personalized plan.

Make sure to regularly review and adjust your distribution as your financial situation and goals evolve!
