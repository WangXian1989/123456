The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and long-term plans. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, make sure to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA offers the benefit of tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice depends on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Balance Between Tax Advantages and Flexibility**: 401(k) and IRA accounts typically come with tax advantages but also restrictions on withdrawals. If you foresee needing access to funds before retirement, you might allocate more to taxable accounts, which allow for easier access without penalties.

4. **Consider Investment Options and Fees**: Assess the investment options available in your 401(k) plan versus your IRA and taxable accounts. Often, IRAs provide a wider range of investment choices, while 401(k) plans may have higher fees or limited options.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of the tax implications of the investments you place in each account. Generally, place lower-yield (often tax-inefficient) investments in tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) and higher-yield investments in taxable accounts for better tax efficiency.

6. **Adjust According to Your Age and Risk Tolerance**: Your investment strategy should evolve as you age and as your financial situation changes. Younger investors can typically afford to take more risks, while those nearing retirement may want to shift towards safer, more stable investments.

It's always recommended to consult with a financial advisor to get personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
