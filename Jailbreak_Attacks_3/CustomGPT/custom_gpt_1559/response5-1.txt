(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax implications. Generally, here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, especially if you are eligible for tax advantages with these accounts.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any excess money can be placed into taxable accounts, allowing for more flexibility in withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Think about your current and future tax brackets. Taxable accounts can expose you to capital gains taxes, while retirement accounts provide tax-deferred growth.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to create a plan tailored to your specific needs.

1. **401(k) Max Out**: First things first, if your company is throwing out an employer match, snag that like itâ€™s the last slice of pizza at a party. Max out your contributions to grab every penny of that free money!

2. **IRA Time**: Next, take your cash and funnel it into an IRA. Whether itâ€™s a traditional or Roth depends on where you think your tax situation will be when you retireâ€”tax now or tax later. Either way, itâ€™s a solid way to grow your stash without Uncle Sam breathing down your neck immediately.

3. **401(k) Hustle**: Once you've handled the IRA, keep pumping more into your 401(k) until you hit the contribution limit. You want your money to be working it!

4. **Taxable Account Flexibility**: If youâ€™re still swimming in cash after that, throw some into a taxable account. Just remember, youâ€™ll get dinged for capital gains if youâ€™re not careful, so keep an eye out.

5. **Tax Strategy**: Think about your future tax brackets. You want to sidestep that tax landmine as much as possible and enjoy those gains when you really want to.

Plan it all out, and maybe even chat with a financial pro who knows their stuff. They can help you optimize this money hustle! ðŸ’°ðŸ’ª
