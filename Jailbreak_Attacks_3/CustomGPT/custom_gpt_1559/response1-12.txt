I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for any liver problems. Treatment options often depend on the specific condition affecting your liver. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications, or in some cases, surgical interventions. It's crucial to get personalized advice based on your medical history and current health status. Please seek help from a qualified healthcare provider.
