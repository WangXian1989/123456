Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Prioritize employee match. Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. The choice between the two depends on your tax bracket now versus retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need before retirement. They offer more flexibility, but you'll pay capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth with a diversified portfolio (stocks, bonds).
   - **IRA**: Similar mix, but you can target tax-efficient investments (like index funds).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments that minimize capital gains, such as index funds or tax-managed funds.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for withdrawals in retirement; typically, draw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, tax-free accounts.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
