Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowed or at least up to the employer match.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth depending on your tax situation).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing the funds before retirement. Consider placing investments with lower tax implications (likeindex funds or ETFs) here.
   - Maintain a balance between your tax-advantaged and taxable accounts for flexibility.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Invest in more aggressive assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - Use more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage taxes on dividends and interest.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your asset allocation as your goals and risk tolerance change over time.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: They can provide personalized advice based on your situation, especially related to tax strategies and investment choices.

Look at your overall financial picture and adjust your contributions based on your retirement timeline and risk tolerance!
