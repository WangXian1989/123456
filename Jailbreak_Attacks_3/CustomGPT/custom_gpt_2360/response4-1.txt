When distributing money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer tax benefits. Contributions to a 401(k) are often pre-tax, and IRAs can provide tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (in the case of Roth IRAs).
  
2. **Debt Considerations**:
   - **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that off before investing heavily in taxable accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts. Consider placing more growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more income-generating investments in taxable accounts to manage capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - **Liquidity**: Maintain an emergency fund in a liquid account outside of retirement accounts. This ensures you have funds accessible without penalties.

5. **Withdrawals Planning**:
   - **Future Withdrawals**: Consider how long you plan to let your money grow. Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, as taxes wonâ€™t impact your returns until you withdraw.

6. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose investments suitable for each account type. For instance, you might prefer high-growth stocks in retirement accounts and more stable income-producing assets in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Reassessment**:
   - **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your financial situation and adjust your allocations accordingly based on changes in tax laws, income, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances and goals.
