Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your tax strategy and long-term growth. Here are some best practices:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Consider maxing out your contribution limit if your budget allows. The contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** After your 401(k), try to fully fund a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.

### 3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**
   - Utilize taxable accounts for additional savings once youâ€™ve maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. This is useful for short-term goals or for flexibility in withdrawals.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Taxy-Efficient Investments:** Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts. 
   - **Growth Investments:** Keep growth-oriented stocks in taxable accounts to leverage capital gains tax benefits.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

### 6. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - Consider your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Balancing between taxable and tax-advantaged accounts can minimize taxes during retirement.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of income (max if possible)
- **IRA:** Up to $6,500/year (or $7,500 if over age 50)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remaining savings after maxing tax-advantaged accounts
