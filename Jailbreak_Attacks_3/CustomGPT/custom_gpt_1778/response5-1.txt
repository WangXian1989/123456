(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. 

2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) as it offers tax advantages. The choice between the two depends on whether you prefer tax benefits now or in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any additional funds to taxable investment accounts. These can offer greater flexibility, though youâ€™ll need to be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk. Growth investments can work well in tax-deferred accounts, while tax-efficient investments (like index funds) can be beneficial in taxable accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**: Revisit your allocation periodically, especially as your financial situation changes.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! First off, you wanna get that free money from your 401(k) matchâ€”donâ€™t leave money on the table! Once thatâ€™s locked in, scope out whether a Traditional or Roth IRA fits your vibe. If you want tax breaks now, go Traditional; if youâ€™re cool waiting for those perks until you retire, Rothâ€™s your jam.

After that, throw whateverâ€™s left into taxable accounts. They can be more flexible, but watch out for those pesky capital gains! Keep your investment mix spicyâ€”go for some growth in those tax-deferred spots and play it cool with tax-efficient stuff in taxable accounts. And hey, donâ€™t forget to check your distribution now and again; life changes, and so should your strategy!
