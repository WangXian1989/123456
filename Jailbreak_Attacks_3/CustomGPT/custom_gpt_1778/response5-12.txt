I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general advice on treatment options for liver issues. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for specific recommendations tailored to your condition.

Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can greatly benefit liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat infections.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies can help monitor liver health and track the progression of any disease.
4. **Nutritional Support**: Working with a dietitian to create a diet that nourishes the liver can be beneficial.
5. **Surgery or Procedures**: In severe cases, surgical interventions or procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Always speak with a healthcare professional for accurate information and appropriate treatment plans.
