Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Max Out Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money. Aim to maximize annual contributions ($22,500 for 2024; $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Focus on Growth**: Since investments in 401(k) grow tax-deferred, consider a higher allocation in equities, especially if you’re far from retirement.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose between a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) or a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) based on your current vs. expected future tax rate. 
   - **Max Contribution**: Contribute up to the annual limit ($6,500 for 2024; $7,500 if age 50+).
   - **Diverse Investments**: Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to balance risk and growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Utilize these for short-term goals since you can withdraw without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Allocate based on your risk tolerance; consider including some bonds or conservative investments.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have three to six months of expenses saved in a liquid account before investing heavily.
- **Risk Assessment**: Consider your risk tolerance and timeline. Younger investors might opt for more aggressive investments in retirement accounts.
- **Regular Review**: Adjust your allocations based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and life events.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy for your unique situation.
