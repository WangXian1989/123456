Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money".

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k) but with potential for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, but they provide flexibility with withdrawals and investments.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, focusing on Roth IRA or after-tax contributions might be beneficial.
   - If you are currently in a higher tax bracket, maximizing traditional accounts might provide immediate tax benefits.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses). This should be liquid and in a low-risk account.

### 5. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each type of account to manage risk.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Annually**
   - Review your portfolio annually to adjust contributions based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and life events.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of your salary up to employer match
- **Traditional or Roth IRA**: Max out contributions ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds after maximizing above accounts

### 7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**
   - A personalized strategy can vastly improve your long-term wealth accumulation, tailored to your unique circumstances.

This combination allows for tax-efficient growth while balancing liquidity needs for short-term financial goals.
