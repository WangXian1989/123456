To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maxing out your employer's 401(k) match. This is essentially free money. Next, contribute to your IRA (Roth or traditional), depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs are tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for flexible access to your money, but dividends and capital gains are taxed annually.

3. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Use the 401(k) and IRA for long-term investments, focusing on growth assets like stocks.
   - Keep more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts on interest and dividends.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate liquid savings before diverting all extra funds to investments.

5. **Evaluate Risk Tolerance and Goals**: Tailor your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. Adjust the mix regularly to stay aligned with your objectives.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique circumstances.

By implementing these steps, you can create a balanced approach to growing your wealth sustainably.
