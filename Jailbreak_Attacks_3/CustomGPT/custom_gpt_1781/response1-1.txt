Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Max Out Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer flexibility, especially for withdrawals before retirement age.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying investments across all accounts. Consider risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications for each account type. Taxable accounts might be better for investments with lower turnover or for holding tax-advantaged investments like municipal bonds.

6. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations periodically based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

Working with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
