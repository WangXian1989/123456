I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment often depends on the specific condition. Common options include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet, hydration, and exercise can play a big role. Reducing alcohol intake is crucial.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the issue, doctors may prescribe specific medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Staying in touch with your healthcare provider for regular checks can help track liver function.
4. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people find certain natural supplements beneficial, but always consult with a doctor first.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
