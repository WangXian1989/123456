To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k) contributions, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA (whichever suits your tax situation).

2. **Prioritize High-Growth Investments**:
   - Place higher-risk, higher-return assets in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA), as you wonâ€™t pay taxes on capital gains until withdrawal.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments like bonds, which are taxed annually.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate; consider keeping investments for over a year.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts to offset gains.

4. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts, catering to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Set up automatic contributions to maintain regular investment habits throughout the year.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation as markets change and your financial goals evolve.
