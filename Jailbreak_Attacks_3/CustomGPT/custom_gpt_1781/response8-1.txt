Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), and grow tax-deferred. Focus on maxing this out if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax benefits as the 401(k), and you can choose between traditional and Roth options depending on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are less tax-advantaged but offer more flexibility for withdrawals. Good for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing.

4. **Investment Horizon**: The longer your investments can grow, the more beneficial tax-advantaged accounts become. Prioritize these for retirement savings.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider maintaining a diversified portfolio within each account type based on your risk tolerance. 

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep your asset allocation aligned with your goals and risk tolerance by rebalancing periodically.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for a personalized plan tailored to your specific needs and circumstances.
