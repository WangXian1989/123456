To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Take advantage of any employer match.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** While you pay taxes on dividends and interest in these accounts, there's no limit on contributions or withdrawals.

2. **Investment Goals:**
   - Determine your short-term versus long-term goals. Taxable accounts can be better for short-term needs due to easier access to funds without penalties.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds during retirement. Consider tax implications to minimize your tax burden in retirement.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all account types to mitigate risk and align with your investment strategy.

5. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Make sure to maximize contributions to accounts with tax benefits first, ensuring youâ€™re not missing out on free money (like employer matching).

A financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your personal situation.
