(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, consider the following tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
2. **Tax-advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your IRA (Roth or Traditional) for tax-free growth (Roth) or tax-deferred growth (Traditional).
3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maximized your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider taxable accounts for investments that you might want to access before retirement age.

It's also wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

1. **401(k)**: If your employer throws in a match, donâ€™t leave that cash on the table! Contribute enough to snag that match â€” itâ€™s like free loot.
2. **IRA Game Plan**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, pump money into your IRA. If you're cool with tax-free withdrawals in retirement, go for the Roth. If you want a tax break now, a Traditional IRAâ€™s your buddy.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™re maxed out on those sweet tax-advantaged options, hit up your taxable accounts. They give you flexibility and access to funds when you need 'em, just be mindful of those tax implications.

Always consider your short- and long-term goals and if you need more tailored advice, donâ€™t be shy about hollering at a financial advisor!
