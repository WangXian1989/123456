When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some key considerations and strategies to help you make informed decisions:

### 1. Understand the Tax Implications:
- **401(k):** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Taxes are owed on withdrawals during retirement.
- **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; taxes are owed on withdrawals. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, as contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in these accounts do not enjoy tax advantages, and you'll owe taxes on capital gains and dividends.

### 2. Asset Allocation:
- Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance, age, and investment goals. Generally, younger individuals might have a higher allocation to equities for growth, whereas those nearing retirement might lean towards bonds for stability.

### 3. Prioritize Accounts:
- **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match—it's essentially free money.
- **Contribute to IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.
- **Taxable Accounts:** These can be filled with investments that benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates, such as stocks and ETFs, or investment vehicles that generate qualified dividends.

### 4. Regular Contributions:
- Consider setting up an automatic contribution plan to ensure consistent investing across all accounts. This can help with dollar-cost averaging.

### 5. Monitor and Rebalance:
- Periodically review your asset allocation and investment performance, adjusting as necessary to maintain your desired risk profile.

### 6. Withdrawals Strategy:
- In retirement, think about the order of withdrawals: it’s often advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts to manage taxes effectively.

### 7. Consult a Financial Advisor:
- A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy based on your unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
Assuming you have the ability to contribute to all three types of accounts, a general approach could be:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions to an IRA if eligible.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest any additional funds after maximizing contributions to the above accounts.

By carefully considering these aspects, you can create a distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals and tax situation. Always keep your specific circumstances in mind, as personal preference and financial situations can greatly influence what is best for you.
