When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors to optimize your investment strategy. Here are key considerations and strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Consider maxing out any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: They don't offer tax advantages but allow for more flexible access to funds. Invest in tax-efficient options like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Long-Term Goals**: If you’re investing for retirement (typically in a 401(k) or IRA), you can afford to take on more risk with stocks.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: For funds you may need sooner (held in taxable accounts), consider safer investments like bonds or money market funds.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes, sectors, and geographies. Each account type can hold different investments, adding layers to your strategy.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement carefully to minimize tax implications. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max the 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, then consider increasing contributions if you have extra cash flow.
- **Fully Fund an IRA**: If eligible, prioritize funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use any remaining funds for taxable accounts focused on growth investments and tax efficiency.

Consulting with a financial advisor may also help tailor this strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
