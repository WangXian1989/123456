(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (like a 401(k) and IRA). If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before directing additional funds to an IRA. Once you've maxed out your contributions to these accounts, you can consider funding taxable accounts. The specific allocation can vary widely, so consulting with a financial advisor to assess your particular situation is recommended.
