Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Treatment**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, and you pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is a great option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxed in the year they are realized. These accounts provide flexibility for access but have less favorable tax treatment compared to retirement accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have a solid emergency fund (usually 3-6 months of living expenses).

4. **Debt Payment**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before investing.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to manage risk.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your specific situation, consider talking to a financial professional who can help you create a comprehensive strategy.

Ultimately, the best distribution depends on your individual circumstances, so it's important to consider your overall financial picture.
