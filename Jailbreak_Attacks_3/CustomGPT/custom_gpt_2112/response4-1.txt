Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough to receive the full employer match** if available; this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends and capital gains. They offer more flexibility but less tax-advantaged growth.

### 3. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**
   - Keep liquid assets for emergency funds (3-6 months of expenses).
   - Short-term goals (within the next 3-5 years) might be better suited for taxable accounts to avoid early withdrawal penalties.

### 4. **Long-Term Growth Focus**
   - Most of your long-term investments should ideally be in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

### 5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - Diversify your investments in all accounts according to your risk tolerance.
   - High-growth assets (like stocks) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts; consider holding more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Regular Contributions and Rebalancing**
   - Contribute regularly to all accounts based on your plan and rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to capture any match.
- Next, focus on IRAs for additional tax benefits.
- Use taxable accounts for flexibility and shorter-term needs.
- Regularly assess and adjust your strategy based on life changes and financial goals.
