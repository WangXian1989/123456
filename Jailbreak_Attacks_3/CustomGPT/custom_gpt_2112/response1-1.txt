Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Focus on Tax Advantages:**
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax strategy. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax deductions.

### 3. **Diversify Tax Treatment:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, taxable accounts can be a good place for investments like stocks that you plan to hold long-term, benefiting from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) might be beneficial. If you expect a higher bracket, Roth accounts may be more advantageous.

### 5. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Consider the type of investments you hold in each account. Typically, you might want to hold investments with higher growth potential (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth, while keeping bonds or less tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Reevaluate your allocation periodically to adjust for changes in income, tax laws, and personal goals.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** Max out to employer match; consider 15-20% of your income.
- **IRA:** Allocate an annual amount (up to the limit).
- **Taxable:** Any remaining funds after maxing tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion:
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances, as they can provide personalized advice based on your full financial picture.
