Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (3-6 months of living expenses) in a savings account.

### 2. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Match First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If possible, aim to contribute up to the IRS limit.

### 3. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth). This decision often depends on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Max Out IRA**: After your 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA contributions if your budget allows.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investment once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts. 
   - Keep in mind capital gains taxes, so prefer long-term investments.

### 5. **Investment Diversification**
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance across all accounts. Consider asset allocation strategies that apply to the overall portfolio.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Reevaluate your allocation annually based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### 7. **Tax Considerations**
   - Be aware of tax implications for each account type when drawing from them, particularly in retirement.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment strategy and maximize your long-term financial health. Consulting a financial advisor can offer personalized advice tailored to your situation.
