(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may benefit from long-term capital gains rates or to maintain liquidity for short-term goals.
4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment choices complement each account's tax implications.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide a personalized approach tailored to your unique situation.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s break it down! First off, rock that 401(k) and snag that employer match. It’s like free cash raining down on you, so don’t leave it behind! Then, hit up your IRA—if you’re into tax breaks, go Traditional; if you want tax-free withdrawals later, Roth is the way to go. 

Now, for taxable accounts, think of them as your “fun money.” You can invest in stuff that won’t have massive tax hits when you sell. Keep it liquid for unexpected trips or that impulse buy we all know we’ll regret later. Overall, keep it balanced and diversified—don’t put all your eggs in one basket! And hey, if it feels overwhelming, a financial advisor can help you steer the ship!
