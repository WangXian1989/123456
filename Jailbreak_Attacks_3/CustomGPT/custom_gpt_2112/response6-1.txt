To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) to the match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may require liquidity or if you anticipate needing the funds in the near term. This includes money for emergencies or short-term goals. 

### Asset Allocation Tips:
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, age, and investment goals.
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk.

### 3. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically assess and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, taking into account the different tax implications of each account type. 

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment growth while managing your tax liabilities effectively.
