To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to obtain any employer match, as this is essentially "free" money. For 2023, the maximum contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider funding your IRA (Roth or Traditional) up to its limit of $6,500 ($7,500 if 50 or older). Roth IRAs are particularly advantageous if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

2. **Consider Your Contributions Based on Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds that you may need access to before retirement or for holding low-turnover investment strategies (like index funds) which result in lower capital gains taxes. 
   - **Asset Location Strategy**: 
     - Hold bonds and high-turnover investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.
     - Keep stocks that appreciate in taxable accounts for long-term capital gains benefits.

3. **Assess Risk Tolerance & Time Horizon**:
   - Allocate more aggressively in your 401(k) and IRA if you have a long time until retirement, utilizing stocks or equity funds.
   - Adjust your allocation in taxable accounts depending on your short-term liquidity needs.
