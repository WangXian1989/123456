When distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize employer matches, as this is essentially "free money." The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if youâ€™re over 50). 

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your current tax situation. The contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) for 2023. Use IRAs for tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. They offer more flexibility but will be subject to capital gains tax.

**Allocation Strategy**: A common strategy is to prioritize contributions in the following order:
- Max out 401(k) contributions to receive employer match.
- Fund an IRA up to the limit.
- Any remaining funds can go into your taxable account.

**Considerations**: Review your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon for investment to fine-tune this approach, along with the tax implications of withdrawing from these accounts at retirement.
