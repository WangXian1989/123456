Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy you could consider:

1. **Max out employer match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of that match before allocating funds elsewhere, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Depending on your income, consider maximizing contributions to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue contributing to 401(k):** After maxing out employer matches and contributing to an IRA, continue adding to your 401(k). This is beneficial due to pre-tax contributions (if traditional) and possible tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable accounts for flexibility:** Once you've maximized the retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This offers more accessibility for funds before retirement and diversification outside of tax-sheltered options.

5. **Consider tax implications:** Be mindful of tax efficiency. Investments held in taxable accounts may be taxed on capital gains, while those in 401(k)s and IRAs grow tax-deferred.

6. **Rebalance periodically:** As your financial situation evolves, periodically rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a financial advisor:** Given the complexities of tax implications and investment strategies, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor.
