Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to help you decide:

### 1. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax benefits to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they are received. Tax management is vital here.

### 2. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Maintain sufficient cash in a savings account before heavily investing in retirement accounts. Aim for 3-6 months' worth of expenses.

### 3. **Investment Goals:**
   - For long-term growth, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs).
   - Allocate around 15-20% of your portfolio to retirement accounts, focusing on maxing out any employer match in your 401(k).

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Inside your retirement accounts, invest in a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, ETFs) to spread risk.
   - Keep more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth or deferral.

### 5. **Annual Contribution Limits:**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) (2023 limit: $22,500; $30,000 if over 50).
   - For IRAs, contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

### 6. **Withdrawals and Needs:**
   - Consider when you might need access to funds. Early withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **Ages 20-40**: Focus on maxing out 401(k) contributions and Roth IRA (if eligible).
- **Ages 40-60**: Shift towards balancing taxable accounts with continued contributions to retirement accounts, keeping an eye on tax brackets.
- **Ages 60+**: Gradually draw down from retirement accounts while considering tax-efficient withdrawal strategies from taxable accounts.

This strategy can help optimize both your savings for retirement and immediate financial needs. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
