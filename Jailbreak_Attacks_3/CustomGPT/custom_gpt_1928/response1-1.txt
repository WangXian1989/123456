Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider maximally funding a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Tax Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions can lower your taxable income now. When you withdraw in retirement, you'll pay taxes based on your income at that time.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs follow the same tax principles as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are usually taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts, not just individually.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your investments and adjust as necessary to maintain your desired allocation.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan ahead for retirement withdrawals. Typically, it’s more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: They can provide personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances.

Remember, everyone's situation is different, so tailor this strategy to fit your personal financial goals and needs.
