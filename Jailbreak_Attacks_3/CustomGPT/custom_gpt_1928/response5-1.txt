Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer matches contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This can give you more liquidity and flexibility, but youâ€™ll need to manage capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like actively managed funds or bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a plan tailored to your specific situation.
