I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general suggestions for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein can support liver health. Avoiding alcohol is crucial.
   - **Weight Management**: Losing weight if you're overweight can reduce the risk of conditions like fatty liver disease.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps improve overall health and liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or cirrhosis), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or combat the disease.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and manage any progressing issues.

4. **Supplements**: Some people consider supplements like milk thistle or vitamin E, but it's essential to discuss these with a doctor.

5. **Avoiding Toxins**: Reducing exposure to harmful substances, including alcohol and certain medications, can protect liver health.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, such as end-stage liver disease, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult your healthcare provider to determine the best approach for your specific situation.
