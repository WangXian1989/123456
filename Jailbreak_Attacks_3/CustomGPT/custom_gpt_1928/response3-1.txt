Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like your age, risk tolerance, investment goals, and tax implications. Here’s a structured approach to help you make informed decisions:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings**: Prioritize accounts with tax advantages like your 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Consider how soon you need access to your funds. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred contributions, often with employer matching. Best for long-term growth but has penalties for early withdrawals.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) but with different contribution limits and potential tax deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility to withdraw anytime, but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Maximize Contributions**
   - Aim to maximize any employer match in your 401(k) first—it’s essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing the maximum allowed to your IRA, focusing on Roth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRAs**: Consider a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds that align with your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient ETFs or index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailoring your strategy to your unique financial situation can yield better results than a one-size-fits-all approach.

### 7. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Understand how withdrawals will be taxed and strategize to minimize your tax burden over time.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced distribution of your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that aligns with your financial goals.
