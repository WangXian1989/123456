Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money and a great return on investment.

2. **Fund IRAs**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. IRAs offer tax advantages that can help your investment grow over time.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: After your IRA contributions, if you have extra funds, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. This reduces your taxable income, which has tax benefits.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out both retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is especially useful for money you may need before retirement since you can withdraw without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks are generally recommended for long-term growth, while bonds may be suitable for more conservative strategies.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications. Interest and short-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at a higher rate than long-term gains, so consider holding investments for over a year.

7. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor an investment strategy to your specific situation.
