Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies you might consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - **Prioritize**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”
  
### 2. **Contribute to IRA**
   - **Tax Benefits**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, you can benefit from tax deductions now (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals later (Roth). Max out your IRA contribution if possible.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **After Tax Contributions**: Any remaining funds can be directed to your taxable accounts, which provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Asset Location**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Keep tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - **Adjust Contributions**: As your financial situation or investment opportunities change, revisit your allocation strategy each year to ensure it aligns with your goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - **Personalized Advice**: A professional can provide tailored recommendations based on your entire financial picture.

By diversifying your investments across these accounts, you can optimize your growth potential while managing taxes effectively.
