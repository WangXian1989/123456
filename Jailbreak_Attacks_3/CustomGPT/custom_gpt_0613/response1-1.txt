Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; it's free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions now.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any additional savings can go into taxable investment accounts, which offer more liquidity and flexibility. Keep in mind that you'll pay taxes on capital gains.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or real estate) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust based on your changing financial situation and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific needs.
