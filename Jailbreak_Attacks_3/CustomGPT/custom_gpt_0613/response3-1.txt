Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some steps to consider:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offered by employers, allows for pre-tax contributions, reducing taxable income. Check for employer matching.
   - **IRA:** Individual Retirement Accounts (Traditional and Roth) offer different tax benefits. Contributions to a Traditional IRA might be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are general investment accounts where investments are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. **Assess Your Financial Goals:**
   - Determine your short-term (0-5 years) versus long-term (5+ years) goals. Retirement savings should be prioritized, but liquidity needs should also be considered.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Maximize tax-advantaged accounts (like the 401(k) and IRA) first, as they allow your investments to grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - Be mindful of the tax impact on withdrawals from these accounts, especially in retirement.

### 4. **Evaluate Contribution Limits:**
   - For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) ($30,000 if over age 50) and $6,500 to an IRA ($7,500 if over age 50). Ensure you are within these limits.

### 5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account, aim for a diversified portfolio. Stocks, bonds, and other assets can balance risk and return based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 6. **Create a Distribution Plan:**
   - Start by maxing out employer contributions in your 401(k) (if available).
   - Next, consider contributing to an IRA, depending on your eligibility.
   - Finally, contribute to a taxable account, especially if you have already maximized tax-advantaged options.

### 7. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Reassess your distribution and investment strategy at least annually or after major life events.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- If you can contribute $20,000 total:
  - $12,000 (401(k), focus on matching contributions)
  - $5,000 (IRA, prioritize Roth or Traditional based on tax situation)
  - $3,000 (taxable account, for flexibility and liquidity)

### Conclusion:
The best strategy is a balanced approach, prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts, staying aware of your tax situation, and being flexible according to life changes and financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
