Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (either Traditional or Roth) after your 401(k). Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for funds you may need before retirement age or for specific goals (e.g., buying a house, funding education). Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance, allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to ensure diversification. Consider placing more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawals and Taxes:**
   - Keep in mind the potential tax implications of withdrawals. For instance, withdrawals from a 401(k) or Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, whereas Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free if qualified.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Reassess your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals, especially as you approach retirement.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your salary, maximizing employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions ($6,500 for those under 50, $7,500 for those 50+ as of 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest additional savings, focusing on tax-efficient funds.

#### Final Tips:
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
- Keep an eye on your investment performance and adjust as needed based on market conditions and personal goals.

This balanced approach can help ensure you're optimizing your savings for both growth and tax efficiency.
