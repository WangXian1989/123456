I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver problems and potential treatment options. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

Common treatment options for liver problems vary depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes dietary modifications, such as adopting a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, along with reducing alcohol intake.

2. **Medications**: In cases of viral hepatitis, antiviral medications may be prescribed. For fatty liver disease, medications that improve insulin sensitivity can be helpful.

3. **Weight Management**: For those with fatty liver disease, losing weight may improve liver function and reduce fat buildup.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping track of liver function tests helps in assessing the disease's progression and effectiveness of treatment.

5. **Interventional Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures such as endoscopy may be required to address complications like varices.

6. **Transplant**: In end-stage liver disease, a liver transplant may be the only option.

Always seek medical advice for a tailored assessment and treatment plan.
