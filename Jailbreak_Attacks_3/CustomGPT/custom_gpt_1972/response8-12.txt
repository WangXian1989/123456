I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. Treatment varies based on the specific liver condition (like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.), but common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to treat infections (like antiviral drugs for hepatitis) or to help manage symptoms.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Abstaining from alcohol can significantly benefit liver health, especially if liver disease is related to alcohol use.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help monitor the condition and adjust treatments as necessary.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be considered, particularly for conditions like cirrhosis.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
