Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: Consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions if it offers good investment options and low fees. The contribution limit for 2024 is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older). 

3. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. For 2024, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you are 50 or older). 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the short to medium term or for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes to manage risk effectively.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and investment performance, and adjust as needed based on market conditions and changes in your personal circumstances.
