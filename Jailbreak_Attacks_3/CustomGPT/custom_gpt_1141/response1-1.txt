Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax bracket, and anticipated retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar tax treatment as a 401(k). Contributions may also be tax-deductible, depending on your income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You will pay taxes on any dividends or capital gains annually.

3. **Balance Growth and Tax Efficiency:** 
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to avoid taxes on capital gains until withdrawal.
   - Consider holding lower growth or income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where you can be more strategic about when to sell them to manage capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure your investment strategy is diversified to manage risk. This may involve varying the types of assets held in each account.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:** As you approach retirement, consider how you will withdraw funds. Having money in diverse accounts can provide flexibility in managing your tax liability in retirement.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Given the complexities and potential changes in tax laws, working with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.

It's essential to regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.
