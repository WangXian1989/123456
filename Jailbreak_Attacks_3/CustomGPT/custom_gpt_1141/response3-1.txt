The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts** (401(k) and IRA): Contributions to these accounts are often made pre-tax (for traditional accounts) or post-tax (for Roth accounts), which can help reduce your taxable income in the current year or allow for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Distributions from these accounts are taxed as capital gains and may be subject to higher taxes depending on your income level. It might be wise to keep investments that generate higher interest income or short-term gains in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Investment Timeline**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: If you are investing for long-term goals (retirement), focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. 
   - **Short-Term Needs**: If you require access to your funds sooner (for a home purchase or other expenses), consider keeping money in a taxable account for liquidity.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different accounts may have different investment options and fee structures, so look for a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and return.

5. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation can change due to income fluctuations, legislative changes, or shifts in your investment goals. Regularly review and adjust your contributions and asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities surrounding investments and tax implications, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your financial situation.

By taking these factors into account, you can create an effective strategy for distributing your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
