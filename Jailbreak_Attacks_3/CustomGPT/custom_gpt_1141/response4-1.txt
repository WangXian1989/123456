When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to look at your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines to help you:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with matching contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider the investment options available in your 401(k) and the associated fees.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - Contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA can offer tax advantages depending on your income level and tax situation. 
   - A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or investments that you might need to access before retirement.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-exempt bonds, to minimize your tax burden.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.
   - Your investment allocation should reflect your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - It's often beneficial to speak with a financial advisor to tailor an investment strategy that fits your specific needs and circumstances.

Be sure to regularly review and adjust your portfolio as needed to stay aligned with your financial goals and changing market conditions.
