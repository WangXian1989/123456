(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors, including your age, income level, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Generally, a good strategy is to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. This could mean fully funding your 401(k) up to any employer match (if applicable) and contributing to an IRA. Once you have maxed out contributions to these accounts, you can then direct additional funds to your taxable accounts. 

It's also crucial to consider asset allocation (the mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Additionally, withdrawals from different account types can have tax implications, so it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Then, hit up your IRA next. Itâ€™s like getting a good discount on your taxes (who doesnâ€™t love that?). 

Once those are stuffed to the brim, let the excess funds roll into your taxable accounts. Think of it like this: tax-deferred growth in the 401(k) and IRA, then some juicy dividends or capital gains in your taxable account. Just remember, how you divvy this up should vibe with your financial goals and risk appetite. Itâ€™s your cash â€“ treat it like a rockstar! But hey, if you're feeling overwhelmed, donâ€™t hesitate to pull in a financial advisor to help sculpt your masterpiece!
