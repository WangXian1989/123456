When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to evaluate your individual financial situation, goals, and tax implications. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
   - **401(k)**:
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money).
     - Focus on pre-tax contributions for immediate tax benefits.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - Contribute the maximum allowable amount.
     - A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Assess Your Investment Goals:
   - **Time Horizon**:
     - If you are investing for long-term growth (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
     - For shorter-term goals, utilize taxable accounts, as they offer more liquidity.
   - **Risk Tolerance**:
     - Diversify your investments within these accounts based on your personal risk appetite.

### 3. Consider the Tax Implications:
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.
     - Use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains with losses.
   - **Withdrawals**:
     - Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize tax liability during retirement.

### Example Strategy:
- **Contribute the maximum** to your 401(k) to receive the employer match.
- **Next**, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
- **Finally**, allocate any remaining funds to a taxable account for flexibility and growth, using investments that are more tax-efficient.

### Conclusion:
It's crucial to regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, and tax laws. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique circumstances.
