When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for IRA contributions ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions lower your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax benefits to a 401(k) for contributions, but tax implications depend on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for funds you may need before retirement. Be mindful of taxes on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider how to diversify your investments across these accounts. You might want to hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable accounts and more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Annual Re-evaluation**: Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust contributions based on performance, tax law changes, and your financial goals.

6. **Retirement Timeline**: If you're closer to retirement, consider shifting more assets into safer investments (like bonds) within your 401(k) and IRA, while potentially leaving more aggressive growth investments in your taxable account.

Ultimately, the right distribution will depend on your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
