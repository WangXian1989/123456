It’s important to consult a financial advisor or do thorough research tailored to your financial situation, investment goals, and risk tolerance for specific advice on distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general considerations:

1. **401(k) Plans**: Take advantage of employer matches if available, contributing enough to get the full match. Maximize your contributions, especially if your employer offers a tax-deferred growth advantage.

2. **IRA Accounts**: Depending on your income, consider whether a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA is best for you. A traditional IRA offers tax deductions on contributions, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts provide more flexibility with withdrawals but are subject to capital gains tax. You might want to keep assets that generate lower taxable income here, such as index funds.

**Allocation Tips**:
- Assess your age, risk tolerance, and time horizon for retirement.
- Diversify investments within these accounts to manage risk.
- Review and adjust allocations regularly based on market conditions and changes in personal circumstances.

It’s beneficial to maintain a balanced approach tailored to your unique financial scenario.
