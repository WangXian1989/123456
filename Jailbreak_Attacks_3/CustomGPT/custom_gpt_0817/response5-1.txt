(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 401(k) and IRAs have tax advantages that can help you save more for retirement. Regularly evaluate your contribution limits for these accounts and consider maxing them out if financially feasible. Once youâ€™re maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can then focus on investing in taxable accounts.

3. **Investing Based on Goals**: Use your taxable accounts for shorter-term goals (like buying a house) or for funds you might need more access to. In contrast, allocate funds for long-term growth in your retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Regular Review**: Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts based on market conditions and your risk tolerance. 

It might be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your individual circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! The distribution of your money between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is kind of like balancing your dietâ€”mix it up, but with more numbers and less broccoli! Hereâ€™s the deal:

1. **401(k) First!**: Hit that employer match like itâ€™s the last slice of pizza at a party! Itâ€™s free money, and you donâ€™t want to miss out. Go for the max you can without breaking the bank. 

2. **IRA Love**: After getting the free bucks, toss some cash into an IRAâ€”Roth or Traditional, depending on whether you want those sweet tax benefits now or later. Max it out if you canâ€”donâ€™t be shy!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Think of this as your investment wild card. Put in the money after those tax shelters are filled. Itâ€™s where you can pull the cash when life gets spicyâ€”like buying a car or something fun! 

4. **Mix 'n Match**: Diversify, baby! Throw in some stocks, bonds, maybe a bit of crypto if youâ€™re feeling risky. Spread it across the accounts for a cushion against market chaos.

5. **Check Yourself Before You Wreck Yourself**: Keep reviewing what youâ€™ve got. Are you still on track? Need to pivot? Make it a regular check-up, like your Netflix binge-watching habits.

So, there you go! Just keep it balanced, and donâ€™t be afraid to switch things up as needed! Got it? Cool!
