Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA before investing in taxable accounts. These accounts grow tax-deferred, and your contributions may be tax-deductible (especially for traditional IRAs).

3. **Consider Roth Options**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k), where contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Balance Contributions**: After securing employer matches and maximizing tax-advantaged contributions, consider how much you want to allocate to your taxable accounts. These accounts are more flexible but taxable on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Align your investment strategy with the purpose of each account. For example, you might take a more aggressive approach in your retirement accounts, assuming you won't need those funds for several years, while keeping taxable accounts more conservative if you might need the money sooner.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Having money in all three types of accounts can provide flexibility in managing your tax situation and income needs.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment allocations and adjust as needed based on your changing financial situation, investment performance, and retirement goals.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that works best for your specific situation.
