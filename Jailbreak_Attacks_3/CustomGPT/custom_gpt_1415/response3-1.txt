Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after tax, which means your withdrawals during retirement will be tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investments but do not provide the tax advantages that retirement accounts do.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate savings in a liquid form (like a savings account) before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Time Horizon**: If you have a longer time horizon (10+ years), consider more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA. For shorter horizons, you might want to be more conservative.

5. **Debt Repayment**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying this off before funneling money into investment accounts, as the interest may outweigh potential investment gains.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment strategy is diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to reduce risk.

7. **Periodic Review**: Regularly assess your investments and adjust your allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Remember, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
