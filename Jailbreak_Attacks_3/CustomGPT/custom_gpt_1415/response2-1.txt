Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general guide on how to approach this:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. These are beneficial for reducing your current taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don't have tax advantages for contributions, but they allow for flexible withdrawals. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts. Typically, three to six months’ worth of living expenses is recommended.

4. **Debt Management**: Pay off high-interest debt before prioritizing investments. The interest on debt can often exceed investment returns.

5. **Diversification**: Aim to diversify your investments across accounts. Utilize tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes, and consider bond funds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid interest income taxes.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investments with your timeline. If you're investing for long-term goals (like retirement), you might be more aggressive with your asset allocation.

7. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so review and adjust your distribution strategy regularly.

Ultimately, it's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
