To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to reach any employer match, then increase contributions to your IRA. These accounts grow tax-deferred, which can lead to significant tax savings over time.
   - **Use taxable accounts for flexible investment**: Invest in assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Diversify across accounts**: Hold a mix of asset types in each account. For example:
     - **401(k)**: Consider holding more volatile assets (like stocks) since you wonâ€™t touch this money until retirement.
     - **IRA**: Can be used for either stocks or bonds, depending on your risk tolerance.
     - **Taxable accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxable distributions.

3. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk profile across all accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider the order in which you'll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes and reduce penalties. Typically, tapping taxable accounts first can help your retirement accounts grow undiminished.

Remember, it's essential to align your investment distribution with your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique situation.
