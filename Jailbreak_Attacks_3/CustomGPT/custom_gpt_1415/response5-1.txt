(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, a well-rounded approach might include:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you have high-income years, maximize contributions (up to the annual limit).
  
2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you're aiming for tax diversification. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
  
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've contributed the maximum to your 401(k) and IRA, utilizing taxable accounts can offer liquid access to funds and favorable capital gains tax treatment on long-term investments.

Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor this distribution strategy to your personal circumstances.
