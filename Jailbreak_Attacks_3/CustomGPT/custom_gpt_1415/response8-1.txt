The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on a variety of factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here's a general approach that you can consider:

1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), try to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **Traditional IRA/401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, but you'll pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement. It can be advantageous this way if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but funds grow tax-free, and qualified withdrawals in retirement are also tax-free. If you expect your tax rate to increase in the future, a Roth IRA may be beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments, but they offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals without penalties. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

3. **Diversification Across Accounts**: 
   - Be mindful of how your investments are distributed across accounts. For example, placing higher growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s may defer taxes on those gains.
   - Hold more conservative or income-producing investments in taxable accounts, where capital gains can be managed more effectively.

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**: Ensure that you have an emergency fund and consider your short-term goals (like buying a home) when deciding how much to allocate to taxable accounts versus retirement accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As markets fluctuate, itâ€™s important to review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Since everyone's financial situation is different, it could be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Finally, check your contributions against annual limits set for each account type, and adjust accordingly to optimize your tax advantages.
