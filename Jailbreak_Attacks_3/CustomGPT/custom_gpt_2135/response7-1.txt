Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires a balanced strategy. Here are key considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Employer Match**: Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full employer match if available. It’s essentially free money.
- **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions within the annual limits, especially if you're over 50.
- **Investment Options**: Choose funds with low fees and diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Tax Considerations**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed on withdrawal) and a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free growth/withdrawals). Roth IRAs are especially beneficial for tax-free growth, especially if you believe your tax rate will increase in retirement.
- **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you’re aware of the annual contribution limits.
- **Investment Choices**: Utilize a wider range of investment options than in a 401(k).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility & Access**: Use these for savings that you may need access to before retirement. Consider a taxable account for investments beyond tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, municipal bonds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match first.
- **Maximize IRA Contributions**: After the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions as well.
- **Taxable Accounts for Goals**: Use taxable accounts for savings that may be needed sooner or for specific goals (like buying a home).

### General Advice:
- **Diversify Investments**: Across all accounts, diversify to mitigate risks.
- **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed to align with your risk tolerance and goals.
- **Consult a Professional**: It can be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

This balanced approach can help optimize your savings for retirement while considering immediate financial needs and tax implications.
