To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) until you reach the match limit. Pay attention to fees, as some plans may have high expense ratios.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Choose a traditional IRA if you prefer immediate tax benefits; opt for a Roth for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility. Use these for both short-term needs and long-term goals, keeping in mind tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

5. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Review your strategy periodically to adjust for changes in income, tax laws, and personal circumstances.

6. **Consult a Professional**: If unsure, speaking with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your financial situation.

This strategy balances immediate benefits, long-term growth, and tax efficiency.
