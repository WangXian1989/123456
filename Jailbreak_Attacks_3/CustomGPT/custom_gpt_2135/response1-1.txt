Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is free money!
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

2. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you’re in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA).
   - If you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA may make more sense.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have liquid savings before tying up funds in retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Use your taxable account for investments that may generate taxable income (like dividends).
   - Hold high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly assess your portfolio and adjust based on changing goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions if possible.
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the limit, prioritizing the type based on tax implications.
- **Taxable Account**: Use for additional savings or investments with less immediate tax impact.
