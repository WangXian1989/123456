Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. After that, maximize your contributions to take advantage of tax deferrals.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. If you need the immediate tax deduction, a traditional IRA might be better.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you may need access to before retirement. They offer more flexibility, but you’ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### Key Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Investment Goals**: Align your investments with your time horizon and risk tolerance.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Invest income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and growth stocks in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.
