I'm not a medical professional, but I can provide some general information about liver treatment options. It's important to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice. 

Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopting a healthy diet that's low in saturated fats, salt, and sugar.
   - Avoiding alcohol and drugs that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), doctors may prescribe medications to treat the underlying cause.

3. **Weight Management**: 
   - For conditions like Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), losing weight can significantly improve liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and health.

5. **Surgery or Medical Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, options like a liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and treatment tailored to your specific situation.
