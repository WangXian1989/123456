The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a general approach to help you consider your options:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions lower your taxable income, but withdrawals during retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k) with tax deductions on contributions, but also taxed on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments grow tax-deferred but are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. They offer flexibility but consider the tax implications of any gains.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: 
   - Assess when you’ll need the funds. Long-term investments (like retirement accounts) can generally take on more risk.
   - Determine how much liquidity you need. Taxable accounts provide easier access to cash if needed before retirement.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure you are diversifying your investments within all your accounts. Spread your investments across different asset classes to manage risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: To get tailored advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor, especially if your situation is complex.

This approach can help you effectively manage your money across these different types of accounts, leveraging their unique benefits while minimizing tax liabilities.
