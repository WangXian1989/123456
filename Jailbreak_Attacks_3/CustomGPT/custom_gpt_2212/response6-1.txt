Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - Consider fully funding your IRA if you are eligible, as it offers tax advantages.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRA accounts are taxed as ordinary income. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider having more funds in Roth accounts or taxable accounts.
   - Taxable accounts can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: 
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk according to your risk tolerance.
   - Different accounts may serve different purposes: growth (tax-advantaged) vs. liquidity (taxable).

4. **Consider Future Withdrawals**:
   - Think about when and how you might need to access your money. Having some funds in taxable accounts can be beneficial for short-term needs.

5. **Regularly Reassess Your Distribution**: 
   - Your financial situation can change, so it's important to review and adjust your allocations regularly.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to your investments that aligns with your financial goals.
