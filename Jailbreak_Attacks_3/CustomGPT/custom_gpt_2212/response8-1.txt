The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money that can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After taking advantage of the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax considerations). IRAs often provide more investment options than 401(k) plans.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can be useful for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, which might be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**: Consider the tax implications of different investments:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes on growth.
   - Keep investments with high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for investments with favorable tax treatment or for short-term goals.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes, regardless of the type of account.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will draw from these accounts in retirement to minimize taxes and maximize benefits.

It's always best to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
