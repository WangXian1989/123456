The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Plans**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: 401(k)s typically have higher contribution limits than IRAs, allowing you to save more for retirement on a tax-deferred basis.

2. **Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, providing an immediate tax benefit. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility since you can withdraw money at any time without penalties. This can be helpful for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of capital gains tax when selling investments in taxable accounts. Long-term investments (held for more than a year) are taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains.

4. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, maintain a diversified portfolio. Include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to spread risk.

5. **Assess Your Time Horizon**: If you're young and investing for retirement, consider funneling more money into growth-oriented investments. As you near retirement, shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a professional can help align your investment strategy with your specific financial situation and goals.

In summary, a balanced approach that leverages the strengths of each account type while considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline is often the best strategy. Regularly reassess your allocations as your situation changes.
