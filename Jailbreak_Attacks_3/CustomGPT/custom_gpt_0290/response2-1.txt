Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: 
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) at least to the level of your employer's match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred. Consider high contributions here if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals. Choose based on your tax situation now versus in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest for flexibility and liquidity. Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize taxes on capital gains.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your timeline and risk tolerance. Longer timeframes can favor higher-risk investments.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and other investments.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review your asset allocation annually, adjusting as needed to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

### Example Distribution Approach
- **401(k)**: Max out employer match (+ additional contributions if feasible).
- **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA (up to limits).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest remaining funds, focusing on long-term growth with tax-efficient vehicles.

### Final Tips
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
- Stay informed about contribution limits and tax implications for each account type.
