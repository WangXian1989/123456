Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**:
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs, in particular, can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Back to 401(k)**:
   - Once youâ€™ve maxed out your IRA contributions (if eligible), continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you might need in the short to medium term or if you want more investment flexibility.

### 5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider tax implications: place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while also considering your overall asset allocation.

### 6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset distribution based on market conditions, changes in your financial situation, and retirement goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your complete financial picture.

Balancing these accounts effectively can help optimize your tax situation and achieve long-term financial goals.
