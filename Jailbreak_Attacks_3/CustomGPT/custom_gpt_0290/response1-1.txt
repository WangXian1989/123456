Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now. Good if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Suitable if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

### 3. **Debt Considerations**
   - Pay off high-interest debts before investing heavily. Prioritize contributions after employer match and tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - After maxing out your 401(k) and IRAs, consider taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility. They allow for capital gains and dividend taxation, which may be lower than ordinary income taxes.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

### 6. **Regular Review**
   - Reassess your allocation periodically based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** 15% of salary (up to employer match)
- **IRA:** Max out contributions annually (currently $6,500 or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable:** Remaining funds after maxing out retirement accounts
