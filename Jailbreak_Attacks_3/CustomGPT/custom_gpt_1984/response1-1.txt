Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Max Out Retirement Accounts**: Prioritize maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, especially if you receive employer matching in your 401(k). This ensures you get the most tax-advantaged growth.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax deductions; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that generate lower tax liabilities (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Goals**: Determine your investment goals. For long-term goals (like retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, utilize taxable accounts, keeping in mind liquidity needs.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and rebalance your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
