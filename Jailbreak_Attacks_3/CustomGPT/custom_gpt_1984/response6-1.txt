To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's free money).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient vehicles, such as index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Balancing Contributions**:
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, then allocate excess funds to taxable accounts.

4. **Investment Diversification**:
   - Diversify across stocks, bonds, and other assets to manage risk in all accounts.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Assess performance periodically and adjust allocations based on your financial goals and market conditions.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment growth while managing your tax liability effectively.
