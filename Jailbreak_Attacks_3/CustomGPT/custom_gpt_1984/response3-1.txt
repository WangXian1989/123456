Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Traditional or Roth options based on your tax strategy.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and accessibility. This is important for mid-term goals or if you anticipate needing funds before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across accounts:
   - Keep more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like stocks).

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring your strategy to your unique situation may require professional guidance.

Ultimately, the best strategy will depend on your individual financial situation and goals.
