Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Employer Match:** Prioritize contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Contributions reduce taxable income, growing tax-deferred until withdrawal in retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Considerations:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be mindful of annual contribution limits (e.g., $6,500 for IRAs in 2023, plus an additional $1,000 if you're over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts provide liquidity and can be useful for goals outside retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Max out your 401(k) contributions** to at least the employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (consider a Roth if eligible) for additional tax benefits.
3. **Utilize taxable accounts** for any excess savings, particularly if you need flexibility for short-term objectives.

### Regular Review:
- Periodically assess and adjust your allocation according to changes in income, tax laws, and your financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights tailored to your situation.
