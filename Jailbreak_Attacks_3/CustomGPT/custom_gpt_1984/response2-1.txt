Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including tax implications, your investment goals, and your time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
- **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).

### 2. Evaluate Your Tax Situation
- **Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, you're likely to benefit more from tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA). If you're in a lower bracket, Roth accounts may be more advantageous.
- **Future Tax Expectations**: Think about your expected income and tax rate in retirement.

### 3. Emergency Fund and Liquid Savings
- **Taxable Account**: After you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate money to taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility. This can serve as an emergency fund or for medium-term goals.

### 4. Asset Allocation
- **Investing Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts. Consider different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation remains in line with your goals as market conditions change.

### 5. Monitor and Adjust
- **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your distribution strategy and make adjustments based on changes in income, goals, or market conditions.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 20-25% of your total investment if maxing out contributions.
- **IRA**: 10-15%, depending on eligibility.
- **Taxable Account**: Remainder for medium- to long-term goals.
