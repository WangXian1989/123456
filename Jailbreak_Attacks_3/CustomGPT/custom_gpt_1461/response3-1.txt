Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, retirement timeline, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great start.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt:** Before fully funding retirement accounts, pay off any high-interest debt, as this can reduce financial strain.

3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If possible, maximize your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA (depending on your income level and tax situation) to take advantage of tax benefits.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can start putting money into taxable investment accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and can be accessed without penalties, though capital gains tax will apply on profits.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Ensure that your investments are appropriately allocated based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. This may involve a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.

6. **Rebalance Periodically:** Review and rebalance your portfolio at least annually to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Before making any significant financial decisions, it’s recommended to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your needs.
