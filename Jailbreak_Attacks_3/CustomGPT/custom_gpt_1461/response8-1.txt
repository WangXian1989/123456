The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contributions**: If you're under 50, consider maximizing contributions (up to the limit set by the IRS). If you're 50 or older, you can catch up with additional contributions.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Retirement Savings**: Maximize contributions to an IRA after youâ€™ve taken advantage of your 401(k) match.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Choose a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **After Retirement Savings**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you have maximized tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility but may incur capital gains taxes. Consider holding investment types that are tax-efficient, like Index funds or ETFs.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure you maintain a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Different accounts may have different asset allocations based on tax implications, liquidity needs, and investment goals.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, and keep investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

As individual circumstances vary, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
