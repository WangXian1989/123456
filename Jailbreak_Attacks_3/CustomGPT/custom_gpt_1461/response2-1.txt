Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your age, financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match â€“ it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match limit first.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next (traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax strategy).

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Traditional Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions may reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, this might be advantageous.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility, as money can be accessed without penalties before retirement age. Remember to consider capital gains taxes when investing in these accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance. Different account types can hold various asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) based on your overall investment strategy.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio based on your changing financial situation and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, or if your financial situation is complex, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

The key is to keep a balanced approach that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
