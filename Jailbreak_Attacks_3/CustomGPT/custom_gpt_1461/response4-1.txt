It's important to consider various factors when determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some key points to think about:

1. **Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications of each account type. Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA can lower your taxable income in the year you contribute, while withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.

2. **Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, it’s often best to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first, as it’s essentially free money.

3. **Investment Objectives**: Consider your long-term investment goals. Retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs are typically intended for long-term growth, while taxable accounts can be more flexible for shorter-term needs.

4. **Liquidity Needs**: Assess your need for liquidity. If you might need access to your funds before retirement age, keeping more money in taxable accounts could be beneficial since you can withdraw those funds without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are well diversified across all accounts to mitigate risks. This includes considering asset allocation and the types of investments within each account.

6. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type, as these can affect how much you can invest in each.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor an approach that aligns with your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
