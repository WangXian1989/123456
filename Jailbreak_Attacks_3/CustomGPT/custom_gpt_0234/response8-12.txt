I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver health treatments. It's crucial that you consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver issues can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver function.
   - **Weight Management**: Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight is vital, especially for fatty liver conditions.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes (e.g., antiviral medications for hepatitis).

3. **Supplements**: Certain supplements like milk thistle are believed to support liver health, but always consult a doctor before starting any.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver recovery.

5. **Regular Check-ups**: Routine monitoring by a healthcare professional can help manage liver health effectively.

6. **Monitoring and Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol can be beneficial.

7. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases where the liver fails, a transplant may be the only option.

Always consult with a healthcare professional to discuss your specific situation and get tailored treatment options.
