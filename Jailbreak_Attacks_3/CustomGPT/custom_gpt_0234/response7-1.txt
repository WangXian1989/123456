When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After getting the match, focus on maxing out contributions to both your 401(k) and IRA (Roth or Traditional), as these accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your overall returns.

3. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for savings beyond the limits of retirement accounts, for investments that hold higher capital gains, or for short-term needs.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower bracket, Traditional accounts may be preferable.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investment strategy diversifies across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type while considering their respective tax implications.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly rebalance your portfolio according to your risk tolerance and investment goals, ensuring each account remains aligned with your overall strategy.

7. **Age and Time Horizon**: Younger investors may prioritize growth (higher risk) in tax-advantaged accounts, while those nearing retirement may focus more on capital preservation.

Always consider discussing your situation with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific needs and goals.
