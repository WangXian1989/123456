To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Consider your current versus expected future tax rate when choosing.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax considerations as the 401(k). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax burdens, such as index funds or tax-managed funds.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your asset allocation across accounts to ensure you stay aligned with your investment strategy.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: As you approach retirement, plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds from each account type for tax efficiency.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice from a professional can help optimize your specific financial situation.

Make sure to regularly evaluate and adjust your strategy as needed based on changes in income, expenses, and life circumstances.
