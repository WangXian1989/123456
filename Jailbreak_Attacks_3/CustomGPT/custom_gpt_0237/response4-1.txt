To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth, so prioritize contributions here, especially if your employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and future expectations.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or interest income, as they are subject to taxes in the year earned.

2. **Investment Types**:
   - Place high-growth, high-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or capital gains, as these have favorable tax treatment.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA up to the legal limits. Make sure to take advantage of any employer match in your 401(k).

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals based on tax implications when you reach retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and finally from tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

By following these principles, you can optimize tax efficiency and growth potential across your investment accounts.
