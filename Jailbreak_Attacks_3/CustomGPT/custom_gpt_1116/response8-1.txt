Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Timeline:** When do you plan to retire? This affects how aggressively you can invest.
   - **Financial Goals:** Are you saving for a house, college, or other major expenses?

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax; taxes are paid upon withdrawal. Ideal for long-term growth.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional):**
     - **Traditional IRA:** Like 401(k), offers potential tax deduction on contributions, but taxes upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are taxed on capital gains and dividends, making them suitable for short- to medium-term goals.

### 3. **Allocate Your Investments**
   - **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
     1. **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
     2. **Max Out IRAs:** Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount to your IRAs, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA.
   - **Supplement with Taxable Accounts:** Once you've funded tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.

### 4. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - Ensure your investment strategy reflects your risk tolerance across all accounts. 
   - Consider asset allocation: stocks, bonds, and other investments. 

### 5. **Regularly Rebalance Your Portfolio**
   - Adjust your allocations periodically to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A personalized plan can be more effective, especially given the complexities of taxes and investment strategies.

By appropriately balancing contributions across these accounts, you can optimize your tax situation and enhance your overall returns. Would you like to dive deeper into any specific area?
