Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general strategy:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: In 2023, the maximum employee contribution is $22,500 ($30,000 if you’re over 50).

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes paid on withdrawals) and a Roth IRA (contributions taxed now, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Limit**: The contribution limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re over 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest Excess Cash**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This helps with liquidity and flexibility.
   - **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **General Tips**
   - **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes to manage risk.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.
   - **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions to take full advantage of employer matching.
- **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any remaining savings, focusing on long-term, tax-efficient investments.
