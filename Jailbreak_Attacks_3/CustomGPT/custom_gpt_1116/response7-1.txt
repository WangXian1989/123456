To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Fund your IRA next. If you qualify for a Roth, consider prioritizing it for tax-free growth. 

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - Analyze your current and expected future tax rates. Taxable accounts might be more suitable for investments that generate lower taxes (like index funds).

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Use tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher-growth investments like stocks and mutual funds, which benefit more from tax deferral.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding investments that produce less taxable income, such as municipal bonds or tax-managed funds.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquidity outside of retirement accounts for emergencies, typically three to six months of living expenses.

### 5. **Long-Term Goals**
   - Align your investments with your time horizon for each goal. Shorter time frames might require more conservative investments.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Review and adjust your allocations regularly to maintain your desired risk level.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- If you're in your 30s and eligible for both a 401(k) and IRA, you might allocate:
  - 401(k): 15% of your income up to the match
  - IRA: Max out the annual contribution (currently $6,500, or $7,500 if you're over 50)
  - Taxable Account: Any remaining funds or amounts above the maximums mentioned

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A personalized plan can maximize tax efficiency based on your unique financial situation.

Implementing these strategies can help optimize your investment for growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
