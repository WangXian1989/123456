Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - **Prioritize** contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. This allows for tax-advantaged growth:
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maximizing the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) to the annual limit if you're not already reaching it.

### 4. **Taxable Investments**
   - If you have additional funds to invest after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts:
     - These are flexible and provide liquid funds, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and goals. 
   - Consider placing lower-risk investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 6. **Review and Adjust**
   - Periodically assess your investments and adjust contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

### Conclusion
The best approach often involves a combination strategy where you contribute to different types of accounts in a balanced manner. If possible, consult with a financial advisor for a tailored plan that suits your unique financial situation.
