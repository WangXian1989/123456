Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to consider:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts**
   - After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These can offer more flexibility, such as access to funds without penalties (unlike retirement accounts).

### 3. **Diversification and Risk**
   - Regardless of accounts, maintain a diversified portfolio suited to your risk tolerance. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your investment goals.

### 4. **When to Rebalance**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investment allocation to ensure it aligns with your changing financial situation and market conditions.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can tailor strategies to your specific situation.

This approach creates a balanced, tax-efficient strategy for saving and investing for the future.
