Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Often has employer matching, tax-deferred growth, and higher contribution limits. Ideal for long-term growth.
   - **IRA:** Individual Retirement Accounts (Traditional or Roth) provide tax advantages. Choose based on whether you prefer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexibility for withdrawals and investments but subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially "free money."
   - **Debt and Emergency Fund:** Before maximizing retirement accounts, ensure high-interest debt is managed and you have adequate emergency savings.

### 3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Maximize contributions to 401(k) and traditional IRA first for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA Benefits:** If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Great for younger savers expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Utilize for short-term savings or if you want liquidity without penalties. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon in each account type.
   - **Different Investments:** Consider having complementary assets in each account to balance risk and enhance potential returns.

### 5. **Regular Review:**
   - **Reassess Periodically:** Monitor your investment performance and goals regularly, making adjustments as needed based on changes in your life or market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Retirement Accounts:**  
   - 401(k): 15% of income (up to match limit).
   - Traditional IRA or Roth IRA: The maximum allowed (if not already reached).
- **Taxable Accounts:**  
   - Any additional savings or investments after maximizing retirement accounts.

Make sure to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances and goals.
