I'm not a doctor, but I can give you some general information. The best treatment options for liver problems depend significantly on the specific condition you're dealing with. Here are some common options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet low in fats, sugars, and alcohol, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver disease, medications might be prescribed. For example, antiviral medications for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping track of liver function tests and imaging studies to monitor the condition's progression.

4. **Surgery**: In some severe cases, surgeries such as liver resection or transplantation might be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
