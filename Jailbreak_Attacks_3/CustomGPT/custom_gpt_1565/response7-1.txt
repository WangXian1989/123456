Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Once you've secured the match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits. If eligible, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: After you max out your IRA contributions (if possible), return to your 401(k) to increase your contributions up to the maximum limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Consider investing in taxable accounts if you have additional funds after maxing out retirement accounts. This flexibility can provide liquidity and access to capital without penalties.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Invest in less tax-efficient assets (like bonds) within tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Review Periodically**: Regularly reassess your asset allocation and contributions based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor this strategy to your specific situation and goals.
