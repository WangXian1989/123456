Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored plan with tax-deferred growth. Typically has limited investment options, but often includes employer matching.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Also tax-deferred, or tax-free growth in the case of Roth IRAs. Offers more investment flexibility.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments subject to capital gains taxes, with more liquidity and fewer withdrawal restrictions.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Start by contributing enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider maxing out your IRA after your 401(k) contributions, especially if you can use a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds you may need earlier or for investments not suitable for retirement accounts.

### 3. **Investment Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance. Higher risk can be allocated to long-term accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) since they have a longer time horizon.
   - **Diversification:** Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.

### 4. **Consider Tax Impact:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Focus on growth investments since withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Suitable for assets you expect to appreciate significantly; withdrawals are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Favor investing in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize annual tax impact.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - **Plan for Withdrawals:** As you approach retirement, plan the sequence of withdrawals to minimize taxes.

### 6. **Regular Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on performance, changes in your financial situation, and market conditions. Adjust as necessary to stay aligned with your goals.

### Conclusion:
Start with employee matches in your 401(k), then prioritize IRAs based on tax implications, and utilize taxable accounts as needed. Always review your strategy as your situation evolves. Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies based on your specific circumstances.
