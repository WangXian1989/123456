Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax bracket and anticipated future bracket.

3. **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**: If you're still below the contribution limits, continue to fund your 401(k). It often has higher contribution limits than IRAs.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in a taxable account. This provides flexibility for withdrawals and avoids early withdrawal penalties.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across these accounts. Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals when selecting assets (stocks, bonds, ETFs).

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

7. **Regularly Reassess**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific situation.
