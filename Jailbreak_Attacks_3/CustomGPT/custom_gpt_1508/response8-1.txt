When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. If your employer offers a 401(k) match, ensure you're contributing enough to get the full match as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA are typically tax-deferred (you pay taxes upon withdrawal), while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts will incur capital gains taxes. Look at your current and projected tax situation when deciding where to allocate funds.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio to manage risk effectively across all accounts. 

4. **Investment Goals & Time Horizon**:
   - For retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider a more aggressive investment approach as you won't need this money for many years.
   - For taxable accounts, you might want to be more conservative, especially if you have short-term financial goals.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**: When it comes to withdrawals in retirement, strategize which accounts to withdraw from first. Generally, it might be wise to take from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the limits for 401(k) and IRA contributions to make sure youâ€™re optimizing your contributions within the legal limits.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, consider seeking the guidance of a financial advisor.

This balanced approach can help maximize your investments' growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities throughout your financial journey.
