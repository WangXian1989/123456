The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). This can provide additional tax advantages.

3. **Back to 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, go back to your 401(k) and increase your contributions up to the annual limit if you can.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve contributed the maximum to your retirement accounts, you can begin investing in taxable accounts. This may be particularly useful for short-term goals or if you need liquidity.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Make sure your investments in all accounts are aligned with your overall asset allocation strategy. Consider factors like age, risk tolerance, and investment timeline.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind the tax implications of your investments. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, while retirement accounts have different tax treatments.

7. **Review Regularly**: Lastly, review your allocation and contributions regularly to adjust for changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your specific situation.
