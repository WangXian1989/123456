When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax Advantages**:
   - Contribute to a **Roth IRA** if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. 
   - A **Traditional IRA** can reduce your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal.
   - Use your **401(k)** for tax-deferred growth, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Diversify Accounts**: Aim to have a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) investments to give you more flexibility in retirement.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you might need before retirement, as they don't have early withdrawal penalties like retirement accounts.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Ensure that regardless of the account type, your investments align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

6. **Regularly Review**: Life changes and market conditions can affect your strategy, so review your allocations annually or after major life events.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also a good move to tailor the strategy to your specific needs.
