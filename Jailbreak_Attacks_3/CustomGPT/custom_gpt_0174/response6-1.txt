Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach. Here are key considerations:

### 1. **Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, deferring taxes until withdrawal. Great for high-income earners expecting lower rates in retirement.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also offer tax deferral; Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals, beneficial if you anticipate higher taxes in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Subject to capital gains tax on profits; useful for liquidity and short-term goals.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for retirement savings.
   - **Short/Medium Term Needs:** Utilize taxable accounts for flexibility, especially if you plan to access funds before retirement.

### 3. **Employer Match**
   - Take full advantage of any employer match in your 401(k) first, as it's essentially free money.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Maximize Employer Match** in 401(k).
2. **Contribute to IRA** (preferably Roth if eligible).
3. **Invest any remaining funds** in taxable accounts for immediate needs or diversification.

### Conclusion
Tailor your approach based on your current tax situation, retirement goals, and financial needs. Regularly reassess your allocations as circumstances change.
