To optimize your investment distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then max out your IRA.
   - **Taxable accounts for flexibility**: Allocate funds there for goals within the next 5-10 years, as they offer easier access without penalties.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Long-term growth (retirement)**: Focus more on stocks within your tax-advantaged accounts for growth potential.
   - **Short-term needs**: Use more conservative investments (like bonds or cash) in taxable accounts to minimize volatility.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially if you can take advantage of catch-up contributions if you're over 50.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you qualify, otherwise, use a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - **Asset allocation**: Ensure a balanced approach across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - **Rebalance periodically**: Adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to managing your retirement savings effectively.
