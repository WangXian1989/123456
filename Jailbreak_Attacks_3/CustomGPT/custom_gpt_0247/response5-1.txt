Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first.
   - **Investment Choices**: Select low-cost index funds or target-date funds that align with your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider a Roth IRA. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed annually, especially in a Roth if eligible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **After-Tax Savings**: Use these accounts for funds you may need before retirement.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider municipal bonds, index funds, or ETFs to minimize tax liability from capital gains.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset types across all accounts to manage risk.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investments and adjust as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice that aligns with your specific situation.
