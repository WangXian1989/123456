Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available.
   - **Tax Deferral:** Contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider maximizing contributions (up to the annual limit).

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Choose based on your tax situation. 
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Consider Income Limits:** If you earn above certain thresholds, Roth IRA contributions may be limited.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Use these for short-term goals or emergencies due to easier access to funds without penalties.

### **General Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved in a liquid account.
- **Diversification:** Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on risk tolerance.
- **Long-Term Focus:** Prioritize retirement accounts for long-term growth. Use taxable accounts for specific goals (e.g., buying a home).

### **Periodic Review**
- Regularly assess your portfolio and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired allocation.

### **Consult a Professional**
- Consider speaking with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific situation.
