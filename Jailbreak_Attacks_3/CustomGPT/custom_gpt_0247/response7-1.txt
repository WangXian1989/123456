Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
- **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 2. Assess Contribution Limits
- Max out contributions to retirement accounts first. For 2023, that means up to $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (with catch-up contributions for those over 50).

### 3. Understand Tax Implications
- **Tax-deferred accounts** (401(k), Traditional IRA): Taxes are paid upon withdrawal. These accounts are beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
- **Taxable accounts**: These are useful for flexibility and are taxed on capital gains and dividends. Consider using them for short-term goals.

### 4. Liquid vs. Illiquid Needs
- Allocate funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs and investments that might require access before retirement.
- Keep long-term investments in retirement accounts to benefit from compound growth.

### 5. Diversification
- Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to spread risk.

### 6. Regular Review
- Periodically assess your distribution strategy and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the match.
- **Traditional IRA**: Max out contributions if your income allows.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining funds after maxing tax-advantaged accounts.
