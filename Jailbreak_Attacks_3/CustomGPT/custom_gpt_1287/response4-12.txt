I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that if you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They may recommend various treatment options depending on the specific condition, which could include lifestyle changes, medication, or in some cases, surgery. It's always best to rely on medical advice tailored to your individual situation.
