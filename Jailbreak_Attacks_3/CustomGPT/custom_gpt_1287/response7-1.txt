Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, such as your current tax rate, retirement goals, income needs, and investment strategy. Here’s a general guide:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts may provide flexibility for withdrawals, but they don’t offer the same tax advantages as 401(k)s and IRAs. You might want to keep investments that generate bulk income (like dividends or interest) in tax-deferred accounts to avoid immediate tax liabilities.

3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all three accounts. For example, you might want to hold higher-risk stocks in your tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, while keeping more stable investments, such as bonds, in your taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. It may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing, but this strategy can vary based on your income situation and tax bracket at retirement.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Life changes and market fluctuations can affect your strategy. Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your personal situation.
