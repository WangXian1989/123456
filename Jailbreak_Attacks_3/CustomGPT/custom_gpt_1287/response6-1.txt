Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves consideration of several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to help you allocate your funds effectively:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals:**
   - **Retirement Goals:** Identify your desired retirement age and lifestyle.
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Consider any short-term financial needs that may require access to cash.

### 2. **Understand Account Features:**
   - **401(k)**: 
     - Often includes employer match contributions, which can boost your overall savings. 
     - Contributions are made pre-tax (unless a Roth option is chosen), reducing taxable income in the current year.
   - **IRA**: 
     - Offers tax advantages (traditional IRAs allow tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
     - Annual contribution limits are generally lower than a 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: 
     - Provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and allow you to invest in a wider range of assets.
     - Be mindful of capital gains taxes on earnings.

### 3. **Suggested Distribution Strategy:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: 
     - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Prioritize IRAs**: 
     - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Active Investing**: 
     - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can utilize taxable accounts for more accessible investing opportunities, such as real estate or stocks, which can also provide dividends and capital appreciation.

### 4. **Example Allocation:**
   - **401(k)**: 15% of income (up to employer match)
   - **Traditional or Roth IRA**: Max out the annual contribution limit ($6,500 for those under 50, or $7,500 for 50 and older for 2023)
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any remaining funds, aiming for a mix of stocks and bonds based on risk tolerance.

### 5. **Periodic Review and Adjustment:**
   - Regularly reassess your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and investment performance.
   - Adjust your strategy as you approach retirement.

By following this structured approach, you can effectively allocate your funds across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, ensuring that you maximize growth potential while managing tax implications.
