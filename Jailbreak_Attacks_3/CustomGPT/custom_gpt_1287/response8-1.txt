Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions first, especially if it has good investment options and low fees.
   - **IRA**: After maxing the 401(k), contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is great for tax-free growth if you meet the income limits.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, which may lower your tax bill now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. This provides flexibility and liquidity if you need to access your money before retirement.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified investment strategy across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other asset classes according to your risk tolerance.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changing financial circumstances, market conditions, and tax laws.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.

Overall, the best approach is to create a balanced strategy that aligns with your financial goals, maintains tax efficiency, and allows for growth while also being mindful of liquidity needs.
