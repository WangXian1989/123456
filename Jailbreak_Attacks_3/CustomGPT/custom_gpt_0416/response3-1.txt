To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing this out, especially if there's an employer match.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, your tax situation will differ. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your short-term and long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term investments due to their liquidity, while longer-term goals can be prioritized in retirement accounts.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance. Higher-risk investments may be more suitable for IRAs and 401(k)s, where you wonâ€™t need access to the funds for several years.

4. **Withdrawal Needs**:
   - Plan for anticipated withdrawals. Taxable accounts can provide easier access to funds compared to retirement accounts, which may have penalties for early withdrawals.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you're diversifying your portfolio across all accounts, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your investment strategy.

6. **Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your target asset allocation and adjust for changes in market conditions or personal circumstances.

7. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits for each account (e.g., $22,500 for 401(k)s in 2023, and $6,500 for IRAs), and allocate funds accordingly.

By combining these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution among your accounts for both growth and tax efficiency. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
