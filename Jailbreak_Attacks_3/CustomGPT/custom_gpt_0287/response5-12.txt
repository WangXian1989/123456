I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver treatment options. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help. Reducing alcohol and limiting fatty foods is crucial.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Vitamin and Supplement Therapy**: Some vitamins might be beneficial but should be taken under medical advice.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver failure or tumors, a liver transplant might be necessary.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and tests to monitor liver function and adapt treatment as needed.

Always discuss your specific condition and symptoms with a healthcare professional for tailored advice.
