To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're eligible, contribute the maximum or at least up to the employer match.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your income and goals, prioritize contributions here for their tax benefits (traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or Roth for tax-free withdrawals).

3. **Assess Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may be more tax-inefficient, like bonds or actively managed funds. Long-term investments can benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your accounts to align with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Plan for withdrawals in retirement by balancing between tax-deferred and after-tax accounts to manage future tax liability effectively.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation and objectives.
