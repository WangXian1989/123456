Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals. Typically, a Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Taxable accounts should generally hold investments that are less tax-inefficient. For example, consider placing stocks (which may appreciate more) in taxable accounts and bonds (which generate income) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, as 401(k)s and IRAs impose penalties for early withdrawals.

5. **Diversification**: Use all three account types to diversify your investments. Each can hold different types of assets, which can mitigate risk.

6. **Revisit Your Allocation**: Regularly review and adjust your investments based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and retirement timelines.

It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan that suits your individual circumstances.
