Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to receive the full match before putting more money into other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After maximizing employer matching, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s. These accounts provide tax benefits that can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit (e.g., $22,500 for 2023) if your employer matches. Consider choosing a pre-tax option for immediate tax benefits or a Roth option for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

   - **IRA**: Consider opening a Traditional or Roth IRA. For 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate surplus funds to taxable accounts. These accounts are flexible, allowing you to withdraw funds at any time, but they donâ€™t have the same tax advantages. To mitigate tax implications, focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) that generate lower taxable income.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, younger investors might allocate more to stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement may prefer safer investments like bonds or cash.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor. They can help tailor a strategy based on your unique circumstances.

Ultimately, the ideal distribution will vary based on individual circumstances, so it's crucial to evaluate your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline when making decisions about account allocations.
