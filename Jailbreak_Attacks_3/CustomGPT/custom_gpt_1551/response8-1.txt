Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before directing funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions (up to the annual limit), consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After contributing to tax-advantaged accounts, you may invest in taxable accounts if you have additional funds. These accounts provide flexibility in terms of withdrawals, but you’ll need to pay taxes on any gains.

3. **Balance Your Investment Strategy:**
   - Allocate investments based on risk and time horizon. For long-term growth, you might opt for a more aggressive asset allocation (stocks, ETFs) within your 401(k) and IRA, while considering more conservative investments in taxable accounts due to their immediate tax implications.

4. **Stay Informed About Contribution Limits:**
   - Keep track of the annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts to ensure you’re maximizing tax benefits.

5. **Diversify Within Each Account:**
   - Ensure your investments are well-diversified across all accounts to minimize risk.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

The key is to create a well-thought-out investment strategy that aligns with your financial objectives.
