Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit if there’s a match.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility in accessing your money.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified. Consider stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Periodically review your allocation and adjust based on financial changes, market conditions, and nearing retirement age.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Avoid selling investments in taxable accounts for short-term gains to minimize taxes.
   - Withdraw from tax-deferred accounts in retirement when your income is lower to minimize tax impact.
