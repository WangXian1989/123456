Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to get any employer match available—this is essentially free money.
   - **Max Contribution:** Aim to max out your contribution if possible, as 401(k)s grow tax-deferred.

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth:** Determine whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) is better for your situation, often based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Max Contribution:** Try to max out your IRA contributions as well.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Diversification:** Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds) and for additional flexibility.
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings for emergencies outside of retirement accounts.

### 4. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Hold high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to grow without immediate tax burden.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower turnover or tax-efficient funds.

### 5. **Portfolio Diversification:**
   - Maintain a diversified asset allocation across all accounts, keeping in mind the specific investment goals and timelines.

### 6. **Regular Review:**
   - Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to align with your risk tolerance and market conditions.

### Conclusion
Tailor these strategies based on your individual circumstances, including age, income, and retirement goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
