Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **Max out your IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA (for tax-free withdrawals in retirement) or a traditional IRA (for tax-deferred growth).
   - **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After funding your IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. These can offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) since they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Keep more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they produce interest income that can be taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Reassessment**: Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and your retirement horizon.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
