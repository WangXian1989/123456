The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, retirement goals, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Ideal for higher income earners.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Offers similar tax benefits as a 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Good for younger earners or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes. Utilize them for short-term savings or investments that don't fit tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversification of Investments**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you age, consider the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type. Prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts in retirement can help minimize tax burdens.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice based on your specific financial situation can optimize your strategy.

Balancing these accounts effectively helps you maximize tax advantages and prepare for retirement.
