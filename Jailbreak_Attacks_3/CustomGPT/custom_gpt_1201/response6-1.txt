To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match; this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowable amount, prioritizing a Roth IRA if eligible, for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA):**
     - Good for higher income years; pay taxes later when you may be in a lower tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Use for short-term goals; focus on investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., index funds).

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds) across all accounts to balance risk and growth potential.

### 4. **Rebalance Annually:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### 5. **Liquidity Needs:**
   - Maintain enough in taxable accounts to cover emergencies without penalty, while maximizing retirement accounts for long-term growth.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment approach and enhance your financial future.
