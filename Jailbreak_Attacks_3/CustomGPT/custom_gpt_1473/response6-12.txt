I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information on liver problems. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

Treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while avoiding alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying conditions, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and progression of any liver disease.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures may be required, including liver transplant options for critical liver failure.

For an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan, please consult a healthcare professional.
