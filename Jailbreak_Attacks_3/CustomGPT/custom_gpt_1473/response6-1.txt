To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first; this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** Depending on your income, prioritize contributions to these accounts for tax benefits, especially Roth IRAs for tax-free growth.

2. **Balance Risk and Return:**
   - **Growth Investments:** Use your taxable accounts for more liquid, potentially higher-growth investments, as they can be taxed yearly but offer flexibility.
   - **Stable Growth:** Allocate more conservative investments within tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth without yearly tax implications.

3. **Consider Withdrawal Flexibility:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Maintain some liquidity for emergencies or opportunitiesâ€”these funds can be accessed without penalties.
   - **Retirement Accounts:** Plan withdrawals strategically to minimize tax liabilities upon retirement.

Ultimately, your specific situation (age, income, retirement goals) will influence the best distribution method, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
