To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s. They offer tax benefits that can enhance your savings growth.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments in all accounts are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk and improve potential returns.

4. **Manage Tax Implications**: Consider the tax implications of withdrawals. Taxable accounts allow for more flexible access to funds without penalties, whereas withdrawals from retirement accounts may incur taxes and penalties.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Assess your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid needing to withdraw from your investments prematurely.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Always consider your individual financial circumstances and long-term goals when making decisions.
