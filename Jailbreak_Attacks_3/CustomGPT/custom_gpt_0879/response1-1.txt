Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible for a deductible IRA, consider maximizing your contributions here next for potential tax benefits.
   - **Roth IRA**: If your income allows, consider Roth contributions for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Focus on 401(k)**: After your IRA, return to maxing out your 401(k), especially if it offers unique investment options or lower fees.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Allocate remaining funds to a taxable account for liquidity and flexibility. This can be useful for shorter-term goals or emergency needs.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Invest in a diversified mix of assets appropriate for your risk tolerance across all accounts, but be mindful of tax implications (e.g., holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts).

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Reassess your strategy periodically based on changes in income, tax laws, or your financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your specific situation.
