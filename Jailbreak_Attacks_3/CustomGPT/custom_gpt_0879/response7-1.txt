Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - **Priority**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA and 401(k))**
   - **Contribution Limits**: Aim to max out contributions to your IRA (traditional or Roth) after your 401(k) match.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

### 3. **Debt and Emergency Fund**
   - **Before Heavy Investing**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund (3-6 months of living expenses) and that high-interest debt is managed or paid off.
   
### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Post-Retirement Needs**: Use taxable accounts for investments you'll need before retirement age without penalties. They also offer flexibility in withdrawals.

### 5. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Adjust according to risk tolerance and cash flow needs. Typically, more aggressive investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, where growth isn't taxed until withdrawal.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your strategy based on market performance, life changes, and financial goals.

### Summary
Prioritize employer matching in your 401(k), then contribute to your IRA. Invest in taxable accounts for extra flexibility, and make sure to balance your investments according to your risk tolerance and timeline.
