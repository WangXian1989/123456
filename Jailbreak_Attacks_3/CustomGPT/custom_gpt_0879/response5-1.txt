Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before considering other options.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you can benefit from tax deductions or tax-free growth (for Roth IRAs).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've optimized the tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These are more flexible for withdrawals and can benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Asset Location**: Place higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and lower-tax investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize your tax burden.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund equal to 3-6 months of expenses outside of these accounts for liquidity.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your distribution and adjust based on performance, changing financial goals, and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor is also advisable to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
