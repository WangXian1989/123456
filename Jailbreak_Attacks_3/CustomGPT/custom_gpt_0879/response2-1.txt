Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Next, consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments after you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Use strategies like tax-loss harvesting to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Invest for Growth and Risk**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth. Consider a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term savings or investments that are likely to provide dividends or interest income, which may be taxed at a higher rate.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**
   - Younger investors may lean more heavily toward equities in all accounts for growth.
   - As you approach retirement, gradually shift toward more conservative investments, especially in your taxable and retirement accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation in all accounts to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your unique situation.

### Conclusion
Balancing your contributions based on tax efficiency, growth potential, and your financial goals will help you maximize your wealth over time.
