To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand Account Types:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth; employer match possible.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions; Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes but offer flexibility.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
   - **Max Out IRAs**: If eligible, prioritize funding a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA based on your tax situation.

### 3. Asset Allocation:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Focus on higher-growth investments (stocks), as taxes are deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds), as they'll trigger capital gains taxes sooner.

### 4. Rebalance Periodically:
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and adjust contributions as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: Max out employer match, then assess how much to contribute based on cash flow.
- **IRA**: After employer match, consider maxing out IRA contributions next.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use leftover funds for short-term goals or after-tax investment. 

### Final Thoughts:
- Tailor your strategy based on personal financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
