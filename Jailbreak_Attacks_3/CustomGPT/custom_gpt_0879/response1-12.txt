I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common approaches include:

1. **Medication**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies can help monitor liver function and detect any changes.

4. **Supplements**: Some people find benefits from supplements like milk thistle, but always discuss with your doctor.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver tumors or cirrhosis, surgical options or liver transplants might be necessary.

Make sure to follow up with your healthcare provider for a comprehensive evaluation and tailored treatment plan.
