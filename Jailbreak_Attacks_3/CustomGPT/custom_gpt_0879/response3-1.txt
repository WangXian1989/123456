Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can maximize your tax efficiency and retirement savings. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, which is essentially free money.

### 2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - If you’re not eligible for a Roth IRA based on income, a traditional IRA could be beneficial for tax-deductible contributions.

### 3. **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**
   - After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k), especially if you’re aiming for higher contribution limits.

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - Use these for investment flexibility and to access funds before retirement age without penalties.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Consider Asset Location**
   - Hold high-growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (bonds, REITs) in taxable accounts because they generate ordinary income.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on your financial goals and market conditions.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - It can be beneficial to seek personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

By following these steps, you can make informed decisions that align with your retirement goals and tax situation.
