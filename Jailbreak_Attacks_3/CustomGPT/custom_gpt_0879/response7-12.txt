I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about treatment options for liver problems. It’s essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Medication**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause. 

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Implementing a healthy diet, regular exercise, and weight management can significantly aid liver health. Avoiding alcohol and certain medications that can exacerbate liver issues is also crucial.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and liver function tests can help monitor liver health and adjust treatments as needed.

4. **Alternative Therapies**: Some patients explore herbal remedies or supplements, but it’s vital to discuss these with a healthcare provider to avoid potential interactions.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be considered.

Always follow your healthcare provider's recommendations, and make sure to discuss any specific treatment plans or options tailored to your condition.
