Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The annual contribution limit is higher than IRAs, so consider maximizing your contributions if cash flow allows.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional 401(k)), which reduces your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions and taxes upon withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual dollar limits and income restrictions for Roth contributions.
   - **Diversify Tax Treatment**: Having both types allows for flexibility in taxation during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Accessibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed at any time without penalties, making them good for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient assets here, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains tax.
   - **Long-Term Investment**: Aim for a long-term investment strategy to benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Start with the 401(k)** for the employer match and contribute the maximum allowed if feasible.
- **Next, fund an IRA** with a focus on your tax strategy (Traditional vs. Roth).
- **Any remaining funds can go into your taxable account**, focusing on low-turnover investments to manage taxes.

### Review Regularly:
- Rebalance your allocations periodically and adjust your contributions based on performance and changes in your financial situation. 

For tailored advice, consulting a financial advisor would be beneficial, as they can provide insights based on your specific circumstances.
