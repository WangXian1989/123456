Balancing your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider either a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Max contributions are $6,500 for 2023 ($7,500 if over 50). Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Determine your risk tolerance and required rate of return to choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - **Rebalance Periodically**: Keep the desired asset allocation over time, adjusting for market changes.

### 3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds, ETFs) that generate fewer capital gains.
   - **Tax Loss Harvesting**: Offset gains by selling underperforming investments.

### 4. **Consider Your Investment Horizon and Goals**
   - **Time until Retirement**: Younger investors might lean more towards stocks, while those closer to retirement may favor bonds.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Funds anticipated for near-term use should stay in more liquid, safer investments.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with changing financial goals, market conditions, and life events.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **Aggressive (younger investors)**: 70% in 401(k)/IRA (stocks), 30% in taxable (bonds)
- **Moderate (mid-career)**: 60% in 401(k)/IRA (stocks), 40% in taxable (bonds)
- **Conservative (pre-retirement)**: 50% in 401(k)/IRA (stocks), 50% in taxable (bonds)

### Conclusion
The right distribution can vary based on personal circumstances, so consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized strategy.
