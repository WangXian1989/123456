When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Employer matches can significantly boost your savings.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax benefits; contributions may be tax-deductible. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Stay within annual contribution limits: $22,500 for 401(k)s (2024) and $6,500 for IRAs (with an additional $1,000 catch-up for those 50+).

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your time horizon (short-term vs. long-term) and risk tolerance.
   - Generally, aim for growth in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a 401(k) or Roth IRA) due to long-term capital gains benefits.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account for balanced risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts. If you plan to withdraw early, use taxable accounts to avoid penalties.

6. **Emergency Funds**:
   - Ensure liquidity for emergencies. Taxable accounts can be more accessible without penalties compared to retirement accounts.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. Maximize your 401(k) contributions, especially if there's an employer match.
2. Contribute to an IRA (consider Roth for tax-free withdrawals).
3. Once retirement accounts are maxed out, allocate additional savings to a taxable account for flexibility and access.

### Regular Review:
- Periodically reassess your distribution and investment strategy to align with changes in income, financial goals, and tax laws. 

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
