Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). The tax advantages can significantly impact your long-term growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, but you have flexibility with withdrawals.

4. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have minimal high-interest debt and a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing.

5. **Investment Horizon and Risk Tolerance**: Your age, retirement goals, and comfort with risk will influence how aggressively you invest in each account type. Generally, the longer your timeline, the more you can lean toward equities in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Diversification**: Use your taxable accounts for less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) and keep your more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust as your financial situation and market conditions change.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
