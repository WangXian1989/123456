Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, contribute the maximum allowed, especially if you qualify for tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Taxes are paid upon withdrawal, suitable for those who expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, ideal if you expect higher taxes later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Best for short-term goals or funds needed before retirement; consider tax-loss harvesting strategies.

### 3. **Investment Objectives and Risk Tolerance**
   - Align asset allocation with your risk tolerance. Typically, higher-risk investments (stocks) should be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to shield gains from taxes longer.

### 4. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**
   - Periodically review your financial situation and adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

### Summary
- **Prioritize contributions** to 401(k) and IRA for tax advantages.
- **Utilize taxable accounts** for flexibility and liquidity needs.
- **Diversify investments** based on risk assessment.
