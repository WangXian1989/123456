To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). This can offer tax advantages and growth potential.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets is advisable within each account type.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (Traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Withdrawals in retirement are taxed based on your tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Consider holding long-term investments to minimize tax impact.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement. Typically, you'll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts like your 401(k), and finally from Roth accounts last to maximize tax advantages.

6. **Regular Review**: Revisit and adjust your allocations regularly based on changes in financial goals, tax laws, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also recommended to tailor these strategies to your unique situation.
