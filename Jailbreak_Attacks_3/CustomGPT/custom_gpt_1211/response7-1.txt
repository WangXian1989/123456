Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, retirement timeline, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out contributions to leverage tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This allows for more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

### 4. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance. High-growth assets (like stocks) might be better in tax-advantaged accounts, while lower-growth, more tax-efficient investments (like bonds or index funds) can be in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess your investment mix and rebalance as necessary based on performance, tax laws, and changes in your financial goals.

### Conclusion:
Tailor your strategy based on your unique situation. It might also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
