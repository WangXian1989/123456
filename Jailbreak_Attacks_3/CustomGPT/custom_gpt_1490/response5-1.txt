(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your age, risk tolerance, investment goals, and current tax situation. Generally, it's recommended to maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth. Once those accounts are optimized, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts, which allow for more flexibility but come with tax implications. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide a personalized strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
