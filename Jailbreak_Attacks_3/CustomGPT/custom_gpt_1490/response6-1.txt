To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your contributions (up to $22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older) for tax deferral, especially if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Aim to contribute to a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should be used for funds that you may need access to before retirement, as they allow for more flexible withdrawals and could be invested in tax-efficient funds to minimize taxable gains.
   - **Invest for Growth**: In your taxable account, focus on equities or low-turnover index funds that generate fewer capital gains.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts while considering that some assets should be in tax-advantaged accounts (like bonds) to minimize taxable income.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure that asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Take Advantage of Tax Loss Harvesting**:
   - In taxable accounts, strategically realize losses to offset gains, reducing your overall tax liability.

By employing these strategies, you can optimize your financial growth while effectively managing tax implications across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance may also be beneficial.
