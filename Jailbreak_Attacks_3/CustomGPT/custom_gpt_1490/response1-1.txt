When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - Maximize your annual contribution limits, which is $20,500 for 2022 (or $27,000 if you're 50 or older).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.
   - The contribution limit is $6,000 for 2022 (or $7,000 if you’re 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term goals or investments that may need to be accessed before retirement.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies to minimize your tax burden.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Withdrawals from a 401(k) and IRA are taxed as ordinary income, so consider your future tax bracket when planning distributions.
   - Taxable accounts allow for capital gains treatment on investments held more than a year.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

It’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
