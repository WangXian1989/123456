To optimize your investment distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth until withdrawal; often has employer match.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k) with contribution limits; Roth allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax; more flexible but less tax-advantaged.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; this is essentially "free money."

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider prioritizing Roth IRA contributions.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your 401(k) for more aggressive investments since it’s tax-deferred. Focus on growth-oriented assets.
   - In your IRA, balance between equities for growth and bonds for stability based on risk tolerance.
   - In taxable accounts, favor investments with lower turnover to minimize taxable events (e.g., index funds or ETFs).

5. **Investment Allocation**:
   - Young investors or those with longer time horizons might lean toward more equities. A general rule is the "100 minus your age" formula for stock percentage in your portfolio.
   - Example: If you’re 30, aim for 70% equities and 30% bonds.

6. **Ongoing Contributions**:
   - Max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions yearly, then invest excess funds in your taxable accounts.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your target percentages and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, consider consulting a professional.

By diversifying and leveraging the tax advantages of each account type, you can effectively distribute your money for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
