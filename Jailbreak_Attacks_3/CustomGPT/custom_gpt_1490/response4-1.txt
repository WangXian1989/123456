It's important to consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline when distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here's a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maxing out any employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) to take advantage of tax benefits. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out your IRA contribution limit, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This benefit can grow tax-deferred until retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. This type of account is beneficial for short-term goals or emergency funds, but be mindful of potential capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Your Investments**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and market conditions to ensure diversification across all accounts.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Always review annual contribution limits and tax implications associated with each account type as they can change.
