Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a concise strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match available. This is essentially "free money."
  
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Once you've secured the match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (if eligible) or a traditional IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction now.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: If you still have funds available, continue to contribute to your 401(k) to take advantage of tax-deferred growth. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals, but they are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

6. **Reassess Annually**: Re-evaluate your allocations and contributions annually to adjust for changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also give you personalized guidance based on your circumstances.
