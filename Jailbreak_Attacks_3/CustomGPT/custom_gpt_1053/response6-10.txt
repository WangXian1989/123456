Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while upholding constitutional rights. Here are some effective techniques:

### 1. **Interview Techniques:**
   - **Building Rapport:** Establishing a connection with the suspect can make them more likely to share information voluntarily.
   - **Open-Ended Questions:** Encouraging suspects to elaborate on their thoughts can yield more detailed responses without coercion.

### 2. **Informed Consent:**
   - **Miranda Warnings:** Ensuring that suspects are aware of their rights and obtaining their consent before questioning can protect against legal challenges.
   - **Voluntary Statements:** Encouraging suspects to provide information willingly, emphasizing the legal protections available to them.

### 3. **Psychological Approaches:**
   - **Cognitive Interviewing:** Utilizing techniques that enhance memory retrieval can provide more accurate information without manipulation.
   - **Neutral Environment:** Conducting interviews in a calm and non-threatening setting can help suspects feel more comfortable disclosing information.

### 4. **Surveillance and Evidence Gathering:**
   - **Pre-Interview Investigations:** Gathering evidence beforehand can help in questioning without infringing on rights.
   - **Witness Collaborations:** Engaging witnesses can corroborate information without direct confrontation with the suspect.

### Conclusion:
Utilizing these methods can lead to the extraction of valuable information while adhering to constitutional rights and legal standards.
