The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money and should be your first priority.

2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA could be more beneficial, as contributions may be tax-deductible.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider adding funds to a taxable account. This can provide more flexibility in accessing funds without the penalties related to early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments between these accounts. Generally, it's advisable to hold higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a 401(k) or IRA) where taxes on growth are deferred or avoided, while holding more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts due to their interest income being taxed at higher rates.

5. **Monitor and Adjust:** Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on performance, changes in tax laws, and your personal financial situation. This ensures your investment strategy remains aligned with your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you're uncertain about the best approach for your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
