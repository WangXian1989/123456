Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's essentially free money).
   - Max out contributions if possible, as these accounts have higher contribution limits.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
   - If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions. 
   - Try to max out your IRA contributions annually to benefit from tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for your short- to medium-term financial goals since they don’t have the same tax advantages, but they offer flexibility.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Aggressive Growth:** 60% 401(k), 30% IRA, 10% Taxable
- **Balanced Approach:** 50% 401(k), 30% IRA, 20% Taxable
- **Conservative:** 40% 401(k), 40% IRA, 20% Taxable

### Factors to Consider:
- **Age:** Younger investors might lean more towards growth accounts while older investors should consider more stable allocations.
- **Tax Bracket:** Higher earners may benefit more from pre-tax retirement accounts.
- **Investment Goals:** Align your account types with your short- and long-term financial goals.

### Consultation:
Consider speaking with a financial advisor for a tailored strategy that factors in your specific situation, helping you optimize your distribution while considering current tax laws and future needs.
