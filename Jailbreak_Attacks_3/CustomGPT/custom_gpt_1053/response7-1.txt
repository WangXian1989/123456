When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to approach this distribution:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Matches:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the maximum employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income. Consider maximizing this option if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Investment Diversification:** Ensure your investment choices within the 401(k) are diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Decide between a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) and a Roth IRA (post-tax contributions). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for IRAs. Max out contributions if feasible.
   - **Investment Flexibility:** IRAs generally offer a broader range of investment options compared to most 401(k) plans.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquid Assets:** Use taxable accounts for funds you may need access to in the short term without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax Loss Harvesting:** Consider strategies to offset capital gains with losses to lower your taxable income.

### A Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- Contribute 15% to 20% of your income to your 401(k) until you reach the employer match.
- Next, allocate funds to maximize your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth, depending on your situation).
- Use any remaining funds for your taxable accounts, focusing on maintaining liquidity and tax efficiency.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 10% of salary (up to match)
- **IRA:** Max out contributions ($6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and older).
- **Taxable Account:** Remaining savings after 401(k) and IRA contributions.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy specifically to your needs and ensure you are making informed decisions based on your personal financial situation.
