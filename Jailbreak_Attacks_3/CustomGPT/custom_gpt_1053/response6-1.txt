Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Maximize contributions to your 401(k):** Take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your eligibility and tax situation, consider funding an IRA to benefit from additional tax advantages.

2. **Assess Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-term growth:** If you are investing for long-term growth, consider placing more funds in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Shorter-term needs:** If you anticipate needing funds sooner, it may be wise to allocate more to taxable accounts for easier access.

3. **Consider Tax Impact:**
   - **Tax-efficient investing in taxable accounts:** Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates. 
   - **Loss harvesting:** Utilize losses in taxable accounts to offset gains, reducing your overall tax burden.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts to diversify your investments, reducing risk and potentially increasing returns. 

5. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation to ensure alignment with your investment strategy.

It's recommended to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances and optimize your investment distribution.
