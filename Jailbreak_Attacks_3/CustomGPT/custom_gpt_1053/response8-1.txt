When determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Additionally, consider contributing the maximum allowed if possible.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, you can contribute to a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (with tax-free withdrawals in retirement). If you qualify, prioritize Roth contributions for tax-free growth.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Increase diversification across each account type. For instance, hold a mix of stocks and bonds in your retirement accounts, while considering taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs.

3. **Consider Withdrawal Implications**:
   - Funds in a 401(k) and IRA are tax-deferred and generally subject to taxes upon withdrawal. In contrast, taxable accounts allow for more flexible withdrawal options without penalty. Prioritize tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Funds and Short-Term Needs**:
   - Ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund outside of your retirement and investment accounts. This will prevent you from having to withdraw from your tax-advantaged accounts prematurely.

5. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Consider your current and projected tax bracket. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Traditional accounts may be beneficial. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket, Roth accounts may be more advantageous.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustments**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjustments based on your changing financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

It's highly recommended to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific needs and goals.
