To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**: Each account type has different tax implications and advantages.
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Many employers offer matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also have tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes but provide more flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match first; it is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing any match, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA (if eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth).
   - **Balance Between Accounts**: Depending on your retirement timeline and tax strategy, keep the remainder in a taxable account for flexibility.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing risk and growth potential according to your age, risk tolerance, and investment goals.

4. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and investment performance, adjusting contributions based on your financial situation, market conditions, or changes in investment goals.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - When taking withdrawals in retirement, consider your tax bracket and which accounts to draw from to minimize taxes.

It is advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
