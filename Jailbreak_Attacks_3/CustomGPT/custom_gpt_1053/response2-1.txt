The optimal distribution of money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Plan:**
   - **Employer Match:** Always aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your current taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. Suitable if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Good for younger individuals or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later on.
   - **Contribution Limits:** In 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you are age 50 or older). 

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Funds can be accessed at any time without penalties, making these accounts ideal for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. It’s best to hold more volatile investments here to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Prioritize Contributions:** Start with at least enough contributions to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, then contribute to a Roth IRA (if eligible) or a Traditional IRA.
- **After Maximizing Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts, focusing on investments that will yield favorable tax treatment.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Reassess Periodically:** Review your allocation strategy periodically based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

By following these guidelines, you can work towards a balanced and effective investment strategy.
