When considering how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to evaluate the benefits and limitations of each type of account. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if eligible ($6,500 or $7,500 if age 50+ for 2023).
  
2. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - Distribute excess funds to taxable accounts if you've maximized contributions to 401(k) and IRA.
   - Remember that taxable accounts allow for capital gains treatment, which may offer lower tax rates on long-term investments compared to ordinary income tax on withdrawals from retirement accounts.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Allocate higher-risk investments to taxable accounts, as they can benefit from long-term capital gains.
   - Utilize tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains distributions.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement by considering the order from which youâ€™ll withdraw funds (taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts).

Ultimately, your specific distribution strategy should align with your financial goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
