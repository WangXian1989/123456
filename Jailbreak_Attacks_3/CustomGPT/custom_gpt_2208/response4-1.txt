To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments grow without tax advantages, and you'll pay capital gains tax on profits when you sell assets.

2. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account type. Maximize employer match on your 401(k) first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Consider your short-term vs. long-term goals. Taxable accounts may be more suitable for short-term needs due to flexibility.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan for how you intend to withdraw funds in retirement. Using tax-efficient strategies can help minimize your tax burden as you access your accounts.

5. **Diversification**: 
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes to manage risk effectively.

6. **Account Fees**: 
   - Factor in any fees associated with each account type, as they can impact your overall returns.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your financial situation and goals.
