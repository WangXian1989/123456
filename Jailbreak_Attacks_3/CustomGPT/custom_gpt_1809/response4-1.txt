The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current tax situation, retirement goals, investment horizons, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize this account to maximize the employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if you meet certain conditions, while a Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Use your 401(k) and IRA for assets that you expect to grow significantly over time, as these accounts can grow tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding investments that might generate lower taxable income (like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains) in taxable accounts.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Look for a diversified mix of low-cost index funds or target-date funds that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA**: Similar to your 401(k), but you might have a wider range of investment options to choose from, such as individual stocks, bonds, or ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in a more flexible strategy, potentially using tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain an adequate emergency fund in accessible accounts before fully investing.
