The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for current tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (like 401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Good for high-income years since they reduce your taxable income now.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, allowing for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Great for flexibility and immediate access, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on earnings.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically, limited investment options; choose a diversified mix of funds.
   - **IRA**: More investment choices; consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing, especially in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically assess and adjust your distribution according to changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of income to max out employer match, then continue based on your ability to contribute.
- **IRA**: Max out annual contributions (both Traditional and Roth if eligible).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest additional savings or amounts exceeding tax-advantaged limits.
