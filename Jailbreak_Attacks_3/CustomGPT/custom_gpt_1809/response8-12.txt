I'm not a doctor, but there are several common treatment options for liver problems depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Viral Hepatitis Treatment**: Antiviral medications can be effective for chronic hepatitis B or C infections.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplant may be necessary.

6. **Nutritional Support**: Consulting a dietitian can help tailor a diet to support liver recovery.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options. How does that sound?
