(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, current income, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to receive the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can, particularly if you are in a lower tax bracket.
   
2. **IRA**: Use a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now or a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Determine how much you can contribute based on your income and eligibility.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that you may need to access before retirement age, or for any funds beyond your tax-advantaged contributions. It's beneficial to hold index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

In general, balance your contributions based on your immediate and long-term financial goals, tax efficiency, and retirement timelines.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! The best way to divvy up your cash between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is all about strategy and your personal vibe. Here's the lowdown:

1. **401(k)**: First thing's firstâ€”if your employer's throwing in a match, grab it! It's like getting free money, dude. Aim to max out your contributions if you're feeling financially savvy, especially if you can slide into a lower tax bracket.

2. **IRA**: Next up, the IRA. If you want tax breaks now, go Traditional; if youâ€™re craving that sweet tax-free withdrawals later, Rothâ€™s your jam. Just make sure youâ€™re within the income limits to contribute.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, for your taxable accounts, think of them as your 'fun' money! Invest in stuff you might need to access before retirementâ€”cash that you can use for adventures or emergencies. Stock those with low-turnover investments like index funds to keep those capital gains taxes in check.

Mix and match based on your goals and how ready you are to tackle that tax impact. Keep it flexible and donâ€™t forget to reassess as life changes!
