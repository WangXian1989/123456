I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options that might be considered for liver issues, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: For many liver problems, adopting a healthier diet (low in fat, high in fruits and vegetables) and regular exercise can be beneficial. Avoiding alcohol and certain medications that can stress the liver is also important.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed. For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications can be effective. For conditions like fatty liver disease, insulin sensitizers or vitamin E may be suggested.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider can help monitor liver function and the progression of the disease.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis or tumors, surgical options like liver resection or transplantation might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best treatment tailored to your specific situation.
