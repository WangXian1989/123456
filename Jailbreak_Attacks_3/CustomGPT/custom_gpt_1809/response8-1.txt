Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Employer Match Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're not at the limit and have a matching contribution, prioritize this account next.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement plans.

3. **Taxable Investment Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally, focus on long-term growth investments, as withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it an ideal place for growth-oriented assets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs. Consider capital gains and dividend taxes in your strategy.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts for risk management. 

6. **Review Regularly**: Monitor your allocations and adjust based on changing goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Consulting a financial advisor is also a great way to tailor this strategy to your unique circumstances.
