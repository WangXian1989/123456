To make the best decision on distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Usually employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Great for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, also tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth). Contribution limits apply.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but flexibility with withdrawals and investments.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Max out any employer match in your 401(k) firstâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - Then consider maxing out your IRA (traditional or Roth) for additional tax benefits.
   - After these, contribute to your taxable accounts.

3. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - If retirement is your main focus, lean towards tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For short-term goals or flexibility, prioritize your taxable accounts.

4. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Tax-deferred accounts lower your current taxable income but will be taxed upon withdrawal.
   - Roth accounts grow tax-free, so contribute when you think youâ€™ll be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - As circumstances change, reassess your contribution strategy annually or after major life events.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider reaching out to a financial professional.
