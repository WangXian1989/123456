Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. These accounts provide tax benefits that can enhance long-term growth.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the contribution limits for each type of account. For 2023, for example, you can contribute up to $22,500 to your 401(k) and $6,500 to an IRA.

4. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions lower your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: A traditional IRA has similar tax implications as a 401(k), while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold. 

5. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Consider holding more growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free (like stocks in a Roth IRA).
   - Keep more stable investments (bonds) in taxable accounts, as they may yield lower capital gains and interest income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and life changes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help align your asset allocation with your overall financial goals.

This strategy can help optimize growth and minimize your tax liability as you plan for retirement.
