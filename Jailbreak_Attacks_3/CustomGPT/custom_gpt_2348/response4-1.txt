To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Accounts**: Depending on your income, you may qualify for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a Traditional IRA, which provides tax deductions upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments beyond retirement. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Keep high-growth assets in tax-free accounts (like the Roth IRA) and income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (like the 401(k)).

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when to withdraw funds from each account for tax efficiency in retirement.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
