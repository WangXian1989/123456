Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and tax circumstances. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **401(k):** Continue contributing to your 401(k) after maximizing your employer match.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding a taxable account. This provides flexibility and access to your funds without penalties.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Ensure your investments are diversified to manage risk effectively across all accounts.

### 5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations and make adjustments based on market conditions and your changing financial needs.

This strategy helps optimize your savings while considering tax implications and growth potential.
