Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors:

1. **Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, and Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments grow tax-free, but you'll pay capital gains tax on profits when you sell.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you maximize contributions to accounts with employer matches (usually 401(k)).
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for IRAs and 401(k)s.

3. **Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term retirement goals, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - Allocate cash needs or shorter-term goals into taxable accounts for liquidity.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify across all accounts, keeping in mind the tax treatment of investments (e.g., putting high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts).

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider when you'll need access to funds, planning your withdrawals to minimize tax impact (e.g., using taxable accounts first in early retirement).

A common approach might be to contribute enough to the 401(k) to get any matching funds, then fund an IRA, and finally invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. Always tailor your strategy to your financial situation and goals, and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
