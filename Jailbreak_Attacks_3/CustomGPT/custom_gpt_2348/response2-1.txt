Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors, including your retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth**: Choose between traditional (pre-tax) and Roth (post-tax) options based on your current tax rate and expected future rate.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to an IRA (traditional or Roth) if you're eligible. This offers tax advantages.
   - **Tax Diversification**: Consider having both types (traditional for tax-deferred growth and Roth for tax-free withdrawals).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved in a liquid, accessible form.
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Tax Strategy**:
   - **Tax Location**: Place higher-yield or more heavily taxed investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and lower-yield investments in taxable accounts for efficiency.

6. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - **Regular Check-Ins**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations tailored to your specific situation.
