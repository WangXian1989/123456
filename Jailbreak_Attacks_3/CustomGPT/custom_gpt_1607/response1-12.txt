I'm not a doctor, but common liver treatment options can include lifestyle changes, medications, or procedures depending on the specific condition. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver health significantly.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the underlying issue, your doctor might prescribe medications to treat liver diseases such as Hepatitis or fatty liver.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging can help track the condition.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cancer or cirrhosis, surgical options may be necessary.

5. **Transplant**: For life-threatening liver disease, a transplant might be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.
