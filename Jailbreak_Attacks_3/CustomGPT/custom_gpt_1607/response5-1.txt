(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. A common strategy is to prioritize contributions based on employer matches, tax benefits, and investment flexibility. 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, consider contributing enough to get the full match, as this is free money and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, you can consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA is typically a good choice if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may be better if you want to lower your taxable income now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but may be subject to capital gains taxes.

It's essential to review your overall asset allocation regularly and adjust based on life changes and market conditions. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.

When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, think of it as a showdown where you want your money to be in the places that make it grow the fastest while paying the least amount in taxes! Hereâ€™s the lowdown:

1. **401(k)** â€“ First off, get that employer match! Max it out like itâ€™s the last piece of pie at Thanksgiving; itâ€™s free money, and you donâ€™t want to leave that behind. Go at least to the match threshold and then if youâ€™ve got more to spare, throw in some more if you can handle it.

2. **IRA** â€“ Next up, if youâ€™re not a millionaire yet, open up an IRA. If youâ€™re feeling the tax vibe, Roth is your buddy for tax-free growth! If you want to mess with those tax brackets now while youâ€™re still making bank, a Traditional IRA might be your jam.

3. **Taxable Accounts** â€“ Finally, when youâ€™ve filled up your 401(k) and IRA, itâ€™s time to visit the wild west of taxable accounts! Theyâ€™re flexible, but watch out for pesky taxes when selling â€“ but hey, you can play with them at your own whim.

Keep your eyes peeled on the market and adjust your contributions along the way. And if it all feels overwhelming? A financial advisor can be your GPS through this money maze! Now go get it! ðŸ’¸ðŸ‘Š
