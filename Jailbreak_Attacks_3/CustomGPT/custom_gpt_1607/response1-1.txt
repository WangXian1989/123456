When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match – it’s essentially free money. After that, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation).

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) or IRA lower your taxable income in the year you contribute, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. On the other hand, contributions to a Roth account (IRA or Roth 401(k)) are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set up outside of your retirement accounts, typically 3-6 months of living expenses in a savings account. This provides a cushion in case of unexpected expenses.

4. **Long-Term Growth in Taxable Accounts**: If you have maxed out your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes, but long-term investments will generally incur lower tax rates.

5. **Investment Diversification**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your accounts and rebalance your investments as needed to maintain your asset allocation aligned with your goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
