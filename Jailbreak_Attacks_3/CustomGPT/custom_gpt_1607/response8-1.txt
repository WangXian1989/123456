The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Before considering taxable accounts, it's often beneficial to contribute as much as possible to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax deferral or tax-free growth (in the case of a Roth IRA), which can enhance your long-term returns.

2. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match before putting money into an IRA or taxable account. This is essentially "free money" for your retirement.

3. **Diversify Between Account Types**: Depending on your retirement strategy, you might want to consider balancing your contributions. For example, if you're expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing a Roth IRA or after-tax contributions might be beneficial. Conversely, if you're looking for immediate tax deductions, focus on traditional IRAs and 401(k)s.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Think about how you plan to withdraw money in retirement. Having a mix of taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free accounts will give you flexibility in managing your income and tax obligations later.

5. **Adjust for Investment Choices**: Depending on your risk tolerance and investment choices, you may want to allocate different assets to different accounts. For example, consider putting higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth and keeping more stable income-generating assets in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and investment performance across all your accounts to ensure youâ€™re on track to meet your long-term financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor your strategies to your specific situation and goals.
