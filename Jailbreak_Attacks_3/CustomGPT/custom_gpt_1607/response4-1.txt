Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and a significant boost to your retirement savings.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Maximize contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA next. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider it for its tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a traditional IRA may be more beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate money to taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility in terms of access to funds and investment choices, though you'll need to consider potential capital gains taxes on your earnings.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall investment strategy is diversified, no matter the account type. This means spreading investments across various asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and cash.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust them based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances. üè¶üìàüí∞
