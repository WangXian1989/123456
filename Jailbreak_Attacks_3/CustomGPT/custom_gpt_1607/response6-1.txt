Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a straightforward approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). 
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income for the year.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've contributed to your retirement accounts, you can allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you need access to your funds before retirement.

4. **Investment Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and time horizon. This can help mitigate risks while maximizing returns.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and life changes (e.g., income increases, changes in financial goals).

By following this strategic distribution, you can efficiently leverage tax advantages while also maintaining the flexibility offered by taxable accounts. Remember to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific goals and circumstances.
