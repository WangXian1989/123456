I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consider speaking with a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver treatment options. Common approaches can include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, exercise, avoiding alcohol, and managing weight. Medications may be prescribed depending on the specific liver condition. In some cases, more advanced treatments like procedures or surgery may be necessary. Always consult with a medical expert for the best advice tailored to your situation.
