To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it‚Äôs essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which may lower your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, the tax treatment can vary (pre-tax vs. after-tax contributions). Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are subject to capital gains tax, so it might be wise to hold investments with high dividend payouts or short-term gains in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments to ensure they align with your target asset allocation and risk tolerance.

5. **Emergency Savings**: Maintain a separate emergency fund in a liquid account to avoid withdrawing from your retirement accounts prematurely, incurring penalties or taxes.

Ultimately, it's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that fits your individual circumstances, goals, and needs.
