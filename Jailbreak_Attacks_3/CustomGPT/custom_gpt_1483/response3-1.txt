Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account; contributions often come from pre-tax income, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account; traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Regular investment accounts; taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: Once youâ€™ve secured the match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
   - **Fill Up the 401(k)**: After maxing out IRA contributions (if you can), go back to your 401(k) to contribute more, ideally maxing out your annual limit.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to minimize tax exposure.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like municipal bonds, ETFs) to manage the tax impact on returns.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your portfolio periodically to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a professional for personalized advice based on your unique financial circumstances.

### General Distribution Suggestion:
- **401(k)**: Aim for 15-20% of your income, especially to max out any employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable (currently $6,500 per year for individuals under 50; $7,500 for those 50 and older).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining funds based on your liquidity needs and risk tolerance.

This strategy can help optimize your financial growth while managing tax implications effectively.
