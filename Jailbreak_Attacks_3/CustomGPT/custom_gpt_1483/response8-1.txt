Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. If you're able, max out contributions to benefit from pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If your income is too high, a traditional IRA may be a better choice.

2. **Consider the Tax Treatment**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k), traditional IRA): Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement. Focus on growing these accounts, as you wonâ€™t pay taxes on earnings until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains. Use this account for short-term goals or investments that produce less taxable income, such as municipal bonds.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize equities in tax-advantaged accounts where growth can compound without immediate taxes.
   - **Income-Generating Investments**: Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid taxes on interest income. 

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider the order of withdrawals carefully to manage your tax bracket and prolong the longevity of your accounts. Generally, it's recommended to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

6. **Professional Advice**: 
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your specific financial situation, investment knowledge, and retirement goals.

These strategies can help you maximize your savings while minimizing tax impacts and aligning with your retirement objectives.
