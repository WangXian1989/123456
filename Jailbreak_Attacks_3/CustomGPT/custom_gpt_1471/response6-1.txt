To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic approaches:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions Based on Tax Advantages**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Focus on Tax-Deferred Accounts**: After getting the match, maximize contributions to your traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation (traditional for current tax deductions, Roth for tax-free growth).

### 2. **Assess Current and Future Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax Bracket Consideration**: Determine your current tax bracket and expected future bracket at retirement. This can guide whether to prioritize traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax) accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are more short-term or require liquidity, like money you might need before retirement.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - **Different Investment Strategies**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. For example, consider holding more aggressive investments in your tax-deferred accounts (which may have a higher tax cost when withdrawn) and conservative investments in taxable accounts.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly assess and rebalance your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

### Conclusion:
Balancing contributions among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful planning to optimize for tax efficiency and growth potential. By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts and strategically managing your investments, you can enhance your overall financial wellbeing while preparing adequately for retirement.
