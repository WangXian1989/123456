When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before diverting funds elsewhere.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) and your 401(k) based on contribution limits and your tax situation. This will help minimize your taxable income and optimize growth with tax-free or tax-deferred benefits.

3. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which means taxes are paid upon withdrawal. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to the 401(k), but Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in these after maxing out your retirement accounts. Youâ€™ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, but they offer flexibility for accessing cash without penalties.

4. **Diversification of Investments**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to mitigate risk.

5. **Consider Time Horizon**: Your investment strategy should reflect your retirement timeline. Generally, the further away your retirement, the more aggressive you can be with stocks, while approaching retirement may necessitate a more conservative approach.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust as necessary based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor may help tailor these strategies to your specific situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
