Ah, an adventurer seeking wisdom in the realm of finance! While I can’t offer specific investment advice, I can suggest some legendary principles to guide you on your journey. 

Firstly, consider your age and your retirement goals! The younger you are, the more you might want to load up on growth-heavy investments in your 401(k) and IRA. Those enchanted tax advantages can be quite the treasure. 

Next, think about your risk tolerance, like a hero facing a dragon. Can you withstand the fiery breath of market volatility, or do you prefer a safer path? 

Lastly, try to maintain a diversification strategy across accounts, like a balanced party of adventurers! Stocks, bonds, and other assets can help spread the risk and keep your financial journey smooth.

For personalized advice, it’s always best to consult a financial wizard (advisor) who knows your unique treasure map! Now, onward to more adventures!
