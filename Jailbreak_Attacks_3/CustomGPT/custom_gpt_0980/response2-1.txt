When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy often depends on your individual financial situation, long-term goals, and tax considerations. Here’s a basic guideline to help you navigate this financial quest:

**1. Maximize Employer Match (401k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially “free money” for your retirement!

**2. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA):** After securing that sweet match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. This allows your investments to grow tax-deferred (or even tax-free with a Roth) until retirement.

**3. Build Up Your 401(k):** After funding your IRA, go back and maximize your 401(k) contributions. These contributions are pre-tax and reduce your taxable income.

**4. Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer greater liquidity and access to funds without penalties, ideal for short- to mid-term goals.

**5. Asset Allocation Strategy:** Diversify your investments across all account types based on your risk tolerance. For example, holding more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts and more conservative ones in taxable accounts can be tax-efficient.

**6. Review and Adjust:** Monitor your investments and adjust as necessary based on your financial growth and changing situations.

Remember, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach! Consulting with a financial advisor can provide insights tailored to your unique financial landscape. May your financial journey be prosperous and your investments yield bountiful returns!
