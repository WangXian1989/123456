To optimize your investment strategy, consider the following approach for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **401(k) Plan**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. After hitting the match, assess the fees and investment options. If the plan has high fees or limited investment options, you might want to limit your contributions here.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider maximizing contributions here first for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you're looking for tax deductions now, consider a Traditional IRA, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates.
   - Keep more aggressive investments here to take advantage of capital gains treatment and to access funds without tax penalties if needed.

4. **Overall Allocation**: Diversify across asset classes depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, prioritize stocks for growth in long-term accounts and balance with bonds or cash for short-term needs.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your asset allocation based on market performance and life changes (like retirement age, income changes, etc.).

This balanced approach can help maximize returns and minimize taxes over the long term. It’s always wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
