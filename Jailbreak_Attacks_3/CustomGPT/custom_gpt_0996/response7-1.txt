Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your long-term financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general framework to consider:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, especially with matching contributions, it's usually wise to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. The 401(k) typically offers tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial for your long-term savings.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax situation. Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth and may provide immediate tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, or if you're looking for flexibility with your investments, taxable accounts offer more accessibility. Investments in these accounts may be subject to capital gains tax when you withdraw funds, so it's important to consider the tax implications of your investment choices.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- Start by maximizing your employer's 401(k) match.
- Next, consider contributing to an IRA to benefit from additional tax-advantaged growth.
- Allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Investment Goals**: Align your asset allocation with your risk tolerance and time horizon. 
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and leave tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation as your financial situation and goals change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored recommendations based on your specific circumstances.
