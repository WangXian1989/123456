Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is free money.
   - **Investment Choices**: Review your investment options within the 401(k) and choose a diversified mix based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions but taxable withdrawals) and a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals). This choice can significantly affect your tax situation in retirement.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to take advantage of tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need access to before retirement or that you want to manage more actively.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside outside of these accounts.
   - **Asset Location**: Place higher-growth investments (potentially more volatile) in tax-advantage accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) and more stable investments in taxable accounts to optimize taxes.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your situation can provide personalized strategies for optimal distribution and growth of your investments.
