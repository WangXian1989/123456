1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight can greatly benefit liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying issues.
3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is crucial for liver health.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and assess any progression of the disease.
