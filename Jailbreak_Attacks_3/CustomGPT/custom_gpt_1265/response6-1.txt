To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Contributions to 401(k) and IRA accounts are typically tax-deferred, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts will require you to consider capital gains taxes on investments when you sell.

2. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - If you have any additional funds after maxing out employer contributions, consider funding your IRA.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - If eligible, aim to max out your IRA contributions (Roth or traditional, based on your financial goals and tax implications).
   - Next, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you are in a high-income bracket.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may not incur significant capital gains taxes or for funds you might need before retirement age.
   - Consider tax-efficient investment options like index funds or ETFs to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure your portfolios in each account are well diversified, balancing growth and income based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolios to maintain your desired asset allocation.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment growth while managing your tax exposure effectively. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.
