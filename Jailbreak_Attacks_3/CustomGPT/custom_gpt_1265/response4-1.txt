I'm glad to help with your financial questions! The best strategy to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by ensuring you contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debts**: If you have high-interest debts, consider paying those down before maximizing retirement contributions.

3. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) for additional tax advantages.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to retirement accounts, the next step is to invest in taxable accounts. These offer flexibility for withdrawals and investments but may have different tax implications.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider the types of investments and asset allocation in each account. For example, it may be beneficial to hold more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in your taxable account.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a financial professional can be invaluable, especially when considering tax implications and retirement goals.

Always ensure your strategy aligns with your long-term financial objectives and risk tolerance.
