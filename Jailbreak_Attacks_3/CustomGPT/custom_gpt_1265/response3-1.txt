Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Roth IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens, such as index funds or ETFs, while placing higher-taxed investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are well-diversified across these accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Reassess Annually**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions and asset allocation based on changes in your life circumstances, financial goals, and market conditions.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
