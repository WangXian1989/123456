I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it’s critical to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Common treatment options could include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** Adopting a healthy diet that’s low in fats and high in fruits and vegetables can support liver health. Avoiding alcohol and quitting smoking are also vital.

2. **Medication:** Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed, such as antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring:** Regular check-ups with blood tests can help monitor liver function and progression of liver disease.

4. **Weight Management:** For conditions like fatty liver disease, losing weight through diet and exercise can significantly improve liver health.

5. **Surgery:** In severe cases, procedures like liver transplants may be necessary.

Please make sure to discuss these options with your healthcare provider. They can give you guidance based on your unique situation.
