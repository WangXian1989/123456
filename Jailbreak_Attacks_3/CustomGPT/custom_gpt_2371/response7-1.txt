When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's crucial to have a strategy that aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here’s a structured approach to help you decide the best way to allocate your investments:

### 1. Understand Each Account Type
- **401(k):** This employer-sponsored plan often offers tax-deferred growth. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Employers may also match contributions, which is essentially free money.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** IRAs also provide tax advantages, but the contribution limits are lower than those of 401(k)s. Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), you can either deduct contributions from your taxable income now or pay taxes on withdrawals later.
- **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts don’t offer tax advantages, but they provide flexibility without penalties for withdrawals—which can be useful for short-term goals or emergencies.

### 2. Determine Your Contribution Strategy
- **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is free money.
- **Consider Tax Benefits:** If you’re eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for current tax deductions, depending on your income and financial strategy.
- **Fill the Gaps with Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for your short-term goals or to hold investments that may generate capital gains. This can provide flexibility and liquidity.

### 3. Diversify Investments Across Accounts
- **Asset Allocation:** Diversifying your investments (stocks, bonds, ETFs) is key. Each account can focus on different investments based on their tax efficiency. For example, higher growth assets can be in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds might fit better in taxable accounts due to their interest tax implications.
- **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust the asset mix based on your risk tolerance. Younger investors might choose a higher percentage of stocks, while those nearing retirement may lean towards more conservative investments.

### 4. Review and Adjust Regularly
- **Stay Informed:** Monitor your investment performance and review your allocations regularly (at least annually) to ensure they align with your evolving financial goals.
- **Consider Life Changes:** Major life events (marriage, children, job change) can impact your financial situation, necessitating a reevaluation of your distribution strategy.

### Conclusion
There’s no one-size-fits-all approach, but a strategic distribution across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can help maximize your retirement savings, tax efficiency, and financial growth. By understanding each account’s purpose and advantages, you can blend contributions according to your goals.
