Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan with potential employer match; pre-tax contributions reduce taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts can be traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when sold.

### 2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to get any employer match first.
   - Fund IRAs after maximizing the 401(k), considering the income limits associated with tax-deductible contributions or Roth contributions.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments once retirement accounts are maximized.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-advantaged Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Focus on investments that generate ordinary income (bonds, REITs) in these accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains (stocks), as these are taxed at lower rates.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for the order of withdrawals in retirement: Generally, tax-deferred accounts first (401(k), traditional IRA), then Roth accounts, and finally taxable accounts, which may help manage tax brackets.

### 5. **Personal Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Consider your time until retirement and risk tolerance. Longer time horizons can afford more risk in growth-oriented investments.

### 6. **Regular Reevaluation**:
   - Regularly reassess your asset allocation based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation or goals.

### Example Strategy:
1. **Contribute**: Max out your 401(k) contributions up to the employer match.
2. **IRA**: Contribute to an IRA based on eligibility.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any additional funds to a taxable account, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

By balancing contributions across these accounts based on your unique financial situation and goals, you can optimize your investment strategy for both growth and tax efficiency. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
