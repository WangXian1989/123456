Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Match**: Always aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it.
   - **Investment Choices**: Review the investment options available to you and ensure they align with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (post-tax contributions). Roth IRAs can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Pay attention to the contribution limits; each account type has its own maximum contribution allowed.
   - **Tax Diversification**: If your 401(k) is traditional, consider a Roth IRA for tax diversification.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, which can be advantageous if you need funds before retirement.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be aware of capital gains taxes on investments; consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Keep some funds in taxable accounts for unexpected expenses or opportunities.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match.
   
2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to your IRA, especially if you can take advantage of tax deductions or tax-free growth.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, contribute additional funds to your 401(k) up to the contribution limits.

4. **Taxable Account Contributions**: Finally, consider allocating additional savings to a taxable account for flexibility and liquidity.

### Additional Tips:
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial planner to tailor a strategy specific to your needs and goals.

By diversifying your contributions among these various accounts, you can optimize tax efficiency while ensuring you have the funds you need during retirement.
