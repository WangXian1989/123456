Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider contributing up to the IRS limit if your budget allows.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA gives you a potential tax deduction now.

2. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account type, ensure you have a diverse asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) appropriate for your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may not be suitable for tax-advantaged accounts, such as short-term trading or investments that generate significant income that would be taxed at a higher rate.

4. **Maintain Flexibility:**
   - Taxable accounts provide liquidity for short-term goals, while retirement accounts are less accessible until retirement age. Balance both for immediate and long-term needs.

5. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor could provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation and goals.
