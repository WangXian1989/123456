Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires understanding the advantages and limitations of each type of account. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as this is essentially free money. Consider maximizing your contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement. These accounts have fewer restrictions on withdrawals, and youâ€™ll pay capital gains tax on any profits when you sell investments.

### 3. **Consider the Growth Potential**
   - Invest in higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks or mutual funds) to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred compounding, while more stable investments might go into taxable accounts.

### 4. **Rebalance Often**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations across accounts based on performance and changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### 5. **Understand Withdrawal Rules**
   - Familiarize yourself with withdrawal rules and penalties for each account type to strategize your distributions during retirement effectively.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your situation, current laws, and market conditions.

By using these strategies, you can create a balanced and effective distribution of your investments across different types of accounts.
