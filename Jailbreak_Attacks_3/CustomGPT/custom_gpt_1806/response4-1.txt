Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide on an effective allocation:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matches and tax-deferred growth, making it a strong option for retirement savings.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Provides tax advantages, but with different tax implications. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts provide flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments, but they are subject to capital gains taxes on earnings.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) at least up to the employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have manageable debt levels and an emergency fund before investing heavily.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you can take advantage of a Roth IRA on your specific tax bracket.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These should generally hold your long-term, growth-oriented investments (e.g., stocks), as they benefit from tax-advantaged growth.
   - **Taxable Account**: Use this for more liquid investments or for money you might need before retirement. Consider holding bonds or funds that produce fewer taxable distributions in this account.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA). If you expect to be in a higher bracket, consider contributing to a Roth IRA.

### 5. **Asset Location**:
   - Place investments that produce high taxable income or gains (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Adjust as Necessary**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your contributions and investment allocations based on your changing financial situation, market conditions, and retirement plans.

### Conclusion:
There's no one-size-fits-all approach. Tailor your strategy to your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Consider consulting with a financial planner for personalized advice that best fits your circumstances.
