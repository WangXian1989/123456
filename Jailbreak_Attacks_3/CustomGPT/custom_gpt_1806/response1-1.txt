Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free. For lower current tax brackets, a Traditional IRA can reduce your taxable income now.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you’re staying within annual contribution limits. Focus on maximizing your IRA contributions after your 401(k) match.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Money in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties before retirement age, making them suitable for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Investing for Growth**: Consider placing investments that generate capital gains (like stocks) in these accounts, as long-term capital gains have favorable tax rates compared to ordinary income.

### General Guidelines:
- **Emergency Fund**: Always maintain an emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing.
- **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to spread risk.
- **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and adjust your allocation regularly based on your life changes and market conditions.

### Personal Considerations:
- **Age and Retirement Timeline**: Younger investors might favor growth investments, while those closer to retirement may prioritize preservation of capital.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Analyze how much risk you’re comfortable taking and adjust your investment mix accordingly.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation and goals.
