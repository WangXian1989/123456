Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a structured approach to help you decide:

### 1. Understand Each Account Type
- **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth, often includes employer matching.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Allows for tax-deferred (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Funds are subject to capital gains taxes but provide flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. Contribution Priorities
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any available employer match—this is essentially free money.
- **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, focus on funding your IRA, particularly if it’s a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 3. Diversification Strategy
- **401(k)**: Look for diversified funds (like target-date funds or index funds) to spread risk. 
- **IRA**: Similar diversification strategy applies; adjust your allocations based on your retirement timeline.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) and consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

### 4. Tax Considerations
- **Withdrawals in Retirement**: Plan for how each account’s tax implications will impact your withdrawals in retirement. A mix can help manage your tax bracket.
- **Short-term vs. Long-term Gains**: In taxable accounts, prefer long-term investments to minimize tax impact.

### 5. Regular Review and Adjustments
- Periodically assess performance and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20%

This can vary based on your personal circumstances and goals, so adjust percentages to fit your risk tolerance and financial objectives.

### Conclusion
- **Consultation**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
- **Continuous Learning**: Stay informed about investment strategies and tax laws to optimize your distributions over time.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively distribute your money across these accounts to support your long-term financial health.
