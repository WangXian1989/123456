Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Implications**:
   - **Borrow and Withdraw Strategies**: Aim to keep investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks and mutual funds) that generate capital gains, while holding income-generating assets (like bonds) in your taxable accounts where they might be taxed at a higher rate.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - In your **401(k) and IRA**, focus on a mix of stocks and bonds that match your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - In your **taxable accounts**, you might want to lean towards tax-efficient investments (e.g., municipal bonds, ETFs) to manage taxable events.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you’ll draw funds from these accounts in retirement. Generally, it’s advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

5. **Revisit Annually**:
   - Review your asset allocation and contributions annually to adjust for any life changes, market conditions, or financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this approach to your specific financial situation and goals.
