Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. It's essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify for a tax-deductible IRA (Traditional) or want tax-free growth (Roth), consider contributing to it next. Max out contributions if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. They're useful for flexibility and short-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Tailor your investments based on your risk tolerance. Typically, keep more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from their tax structure.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: In taxable accounts, consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your distribution as your financial situation and market conditions change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific needs and circumstances.
