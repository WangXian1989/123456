Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can maximize your investment returns and tax efficiency. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) for tax-deferred growth, especially if you're in a high tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Consider Tax Impact**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. For traditional IRAs, contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits. Max out your contributions if possible, especially for Roth IRAs if you qualify.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement age without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-exempt municipal bonds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain liquid savings to cover 3-6 months of expenses.
- **Balanced Approach**: Allocate:
  - 50% to the 401(k) up to the employer match.
  - 25% to IRA contributions.
  - 25% to taxable accounts for flexibility and to manage tax implications.

### Reassess Regularly:
- Review your allocations annually and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and goals.

This strategy balances tax advantages, liquidity needs, and investment growth potential.
