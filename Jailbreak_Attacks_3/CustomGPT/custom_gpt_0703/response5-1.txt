Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize any employer match first; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Contribute to reach the annual limit, considering pre-tax contributions to lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, but prioritize traditional IRAs if you need immediate tax benefits.
   - Aim to maximize this account if you have the available funds after your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement age, or for goals like buying a house or starting a business.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to manage tax liabilities.

### Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough cash reserves outside of these accounts.
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments within each account based on your risk profile. 
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust allocations as needed.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
