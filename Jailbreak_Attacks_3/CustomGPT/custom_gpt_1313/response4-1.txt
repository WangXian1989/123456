Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your investment goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here are some strategies and guidelines that can help you make an informed decision:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offered by employers, contributions may reduce taxable income, and many plans have matching contributions. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed. This can be a good choice if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement, provided certain conditions are met. This is beneficial if you anticipate a higher tax rate in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are subject to capital gains tax. These accounts offer flexibility in withdrawals and can be useful for short-term goals or emergencies.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match and then consider contributing to an IRA. If you're eligible, a Roth IRA can be a powerful tool for tax-free growth.
   - **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, taxable accounts can fill the gap, offering flexibility for both short-term and long-term needs.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Invest for Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider putting investments with high growth potential (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts to maximize compounding and defer taxes.
   - **Place Bonds in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Since bonds generate ordinary income, it can make sense to hold them in tax-deferred accounts to minimize annual tax liabilities.

4. **Review Your Time Horizon**:
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term**: For short-term needs, a taxable account might be preferable. For retirement, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as they are designed to provide for long-term growth.

5. **Monitor and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and the performance of each account type. Make adjustments as needed based on your changing financial situation and goals.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique circumstances and help you create a strategy tailored to your needs.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, while optimizing for growth and tax efficiency.
