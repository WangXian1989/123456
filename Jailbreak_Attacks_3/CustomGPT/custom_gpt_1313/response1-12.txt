I'm not a medical professional, but it's essential to consult with a healthcare provider for any liver problems. Treatment options can vary significantly depending on the specific condition affecting your liver (such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis). Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in severe cases, procedures or surgery. Always seek personalized advice from a doctor for the best care tailored to your individual needs.
