Determining the best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a breakdown of how you might approach this distribution:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan that may include employer matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: A retirement account that offers tax advantages. Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, providing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts where you can buy and sell a variety of assets without tax-deferred growth. Capital gains and dividends are subject to taxation in the year they are realized.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you're in a high tax bracket now, putting more money in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) can minimize your current taxes. 
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing more to a Roth IRA or taxable accounts, where you pay taxes upfront.

3. **Evaluate Employer Matching**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

4. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - Aim to diversify your contributions based on your timeline:
     - **Younger Individuals**: You might prefer Roth accounts (like Roth IRA) for long-term tax-free growth.
     - **Near Retirement**: You could focus on tax-deferred accounts to lower taxable income now and potentially convert to a Roth later.
   
5. **Investment Timeline**:
   - Determine how long you plan to keep your money invested. Longer time frames may allow for more aggressive investments in taxable accounts, while shorter timelines might warrant more conservative strategies.

6. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have enough in accessible cash or liquid investments before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

7. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and adjust contributions as your financial situation and market conditions change.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **40% in 401(k)**: Maximize employer match and take advantage of tax deferment.
- **30% in IRA/Roth IRA**: To diversify tax treatment in retirement.
- **30% in Taxable Accounts**: For flexibility and access to funds.

It's beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your unique circumstances.
