I'm not a medical professional, but liver problems can require a variety of treatment options depending on the specific condition. It's essential to consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice. Generally, treatment might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This can involve adopting a healthier diet, losing weight if overweight, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol.
 
2. **Medications**: Depending on the underlying issue, medications may be prescribed to address viral infections (like hepatitis), reduce inflammation, or manage symptoms.

3. **Nutritional Support**: Nutritional counseling may help manage liver function and overall health.

4. **Monitoring**: Regular follow-ups with your doctor for blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function.

5. **Surgery or Procedures**: In some cases, procedures may be necessary to remove blockages or tumors.

6. **Liver Transplant**: For severe cases, a liver transplant may be considered if the liver is failing.

Again, it's crucial to seek medical expertise to determine the best approach for your specific situation.
