Hello! I'd be happy to help you with your question about distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. It generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. 

Here’s a concise overview:

1. **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth, and many employers provide matching contributions. It's beneficial to contribute enough to get any employer match as it’s essentially free money.

2. **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), IRAs (especially traditional IRAs) offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met. Consider contributing to a Roth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds here are subject to capital gains taxes but offer flexibility in terms of access. They can be great for goals that are shorter-term or if you want to withdraw without penalties.

Would you like more information on one of these options or help with a specific strategy?
