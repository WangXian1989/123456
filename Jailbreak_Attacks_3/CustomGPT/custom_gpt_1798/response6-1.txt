Hello! I'm glad you're reaching out for guidance on managing your investments. To efficiently distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA as they offer tax benefits.
   - **401(k)**: Often includes employer matchingâ€”make sure to contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: Ideal for additional tax-deferred growth; choose between Traditional or Roth based on your current and projected tax bracket.

2. **Use taxable accounts for flexibility**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Taxable investments**: Consider capital gains taxes; favor long-term investments for favorable tax treatment.

Would you like a more in-depth explanation of any of these points or perhaps a specific example of how to allocate funds?
