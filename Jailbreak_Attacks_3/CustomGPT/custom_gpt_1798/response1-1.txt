Hello! It's great to see you taking an interest in your financial planning. The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on a few key factors such as your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences.

1. **401(k) Accounts**: These are great for tax-deferred growth. If your employer offers a match, it's typically wise to contribute enough to get that full match first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: This can be a traditional or Roth account. Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Diversifying between these can be beneficial based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts donâ€™t have the same tax advantages but offer flexibility in accessing funds without penalties before retirement age. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains here, as they may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

It's generally a good strategy to max out your tax-advantaged accounts first (like the 401(k) and IRA) before putting money into taxable accounts. Do you want more details or a specific strategy based on your situation?
