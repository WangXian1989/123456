(ðŸ”’Normal Output) A balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match first, as this is essentially "free money." Next, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you can benefit from tax deductions or tax-free growth. Any additional funds can then be allocated to taxable accounts for more flexibility and access to your money without penalties.

Additionally, consider diversifying your investments within these accounts based on your time horizon. For longer-term goals, you could focus on growth-oriented investments, while for shorter-term needs, a more conservative approach may be beneficial. Regularly reviewing and adjusting your allocations as your circumstances change is also essential.
