To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k)s and IRAs offer tax advantages (tax-deferred growth), which can be beneficial for retirement savings.
   - Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes, so strategies like tax-loss harvesting can be useful.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your short-term and long-term financial goals. Your asset allocation may differ based on your timeline (e.g., retirement vs. buying a home).

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Maxing out your employer match in a 401(k) is generally advisable.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering asset classes like stocks, bonds, and cash.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when you will withdraw funds. This affects tax obligations and account selections.

6. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Align your investments with your risk tolerance. 401(k)s often have limited investment options, whereas taxable accounts provide more flexibility.

**Recommendation**:
- Start by maxing out your 401(k) contributions to take full advantage of any employer match.
- Next, contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth, based on your income and tax situation).
- Allocate any additional funds to your taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

This approach balances immediate tax benefits with growth potential and strategic planning for future withdrawals. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
