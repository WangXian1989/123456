I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional about liver problems. Treatment options can vary based on the specific condition affecting your liver. Generally, lifestyle changes such as altering your diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can have significant positive effects. Additionally, medications may be prescribed depending on the underlying cause, such as antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease. In severe cases, procedures or surgeries might be necessary. Always seek personalized advice from a medical professional.
