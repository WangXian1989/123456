I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Some common approaches might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Limit processed foods, sugars, and saturated fats.
   - **Alcohol Reduction**: Reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption, as it can exacerbate liver issues.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), your doctor might prescribe medications to treat the underlying issue.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition's progression and adjust treatments as necessary.

4. **Management of Coexisting Conditions**: If you have conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol, managing those effectively can also benefit liver health.

5. **Potential Procedures**: In some cases, procedures like liver biopsy or more advanced treatments may be necessary based on a healthcare provider's assessment.

Always consult a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your situation.
