When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match in your 401(k).

2. **Account Types and Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits as 401(k)s. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them ideal for tax diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in these accounts incur capital gains taxes when sold. Use them for more liquid needs.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Utilize your tax-advantaged accounts for investments with high growth potential (e.g., stocks), as tax implications are deferred.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Develop a withdrawal strategy that considers tax brackets. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your financial situation.

By strategically leveraging the benefits and limitations of each account type, you can effectively allocate your money for long-term growth and tax efficiency.
