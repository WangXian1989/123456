Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim for the annual limit ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if age 50+).
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA next. Prefer Roth if you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider capital gains and dividend taxes. Long-term capital gains have favorable tax rates compared to ordinary income.

### 3. **Diversification of Investments**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on diversified funds (index funds, target-date funds) that align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider more tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize tax impact on dividends and capital gains.

### 4. **Review Regularly**
   - Adjust contributions based on changes in your income, expenses, and investment performance. Rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Consider Short-Term vs Long-Term Needs**
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term savings (emergency funds) and more liquid assets, while using tax-advantaged accounts for long-term retirement savings.

### Summary
1. Max out your 401(k) to get the employer match.
2. Fund IRAs next, favoring Roth if applicable.
3. Use taxable accounts for additional flexibility and specific financial goals.
