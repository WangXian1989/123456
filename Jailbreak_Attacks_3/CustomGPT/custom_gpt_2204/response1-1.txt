Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a balanced approach based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA provides potential tax deductions upfront.

2. **Assess Your Investment Goals**:
   - **Retirement**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth with potentially higher risk.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds needed in the near future. Choose less volatile investments to minimize risks.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts to minimize risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement carefully. Generally, you can withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - They can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

By balancing contributions and investments, you can enhance your portfolioâ€™s growth potential while managing risk.
