Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing the match. Roth IRAs can be beneficial for tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may offer upfront tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider taxable accounts for flexibility. They allow easy access to funds without penalties and can be beneficial for short- to medium-term goals.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on risk tolerance and investment goals. Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals. 401(k) and Traditional IRAs are taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth IRAs and taxable accounts offer different tax treatment for gains.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and personal financial situations.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% to max out employer match.
- **IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if over age 50) annually if you can.
- **Taxable**: Fund this for additional long-term goals once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, it's ideal to balance contributions to take advantage of tax benefits while also ensuring liquidity and investment diversity. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
