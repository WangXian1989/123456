To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income. Good for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional vs. Roth), contributions can be tax-deductible or tax-free during retirement. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here don’t have tax advantages but provide flexibility and accessibility.

3. **Investment Types**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher-growth investments (stocks) to defer or eliminate taxes on these earnings.
   - Consider holding lower-growth investments (such as bonds) in taxable accounts, as they may be taxed at lower capital gains rates.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain an emergency fund in accessible accounts (like a savings account) before maximizing retirement contributions.

5. **Diversification**: Allocate across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account to spread risk and optimize returns.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you will draw funds in retirement, considering tax implications for each account type.

It’s often beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation and goals.
