(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and retirement plans. 

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer contributions if available. Consider contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
2. **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate income or capital gains that won't be taxed until sold. This option offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

Aim for tax efficiency, focusing on higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts while keeping more stable investments in taxable accounts.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! When it comes to spreading your cash among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, think of it like a money pie, and you want the biggest slices where theyâ€™ll pay off the most later. 

1. **401(k)**: First things firstâ€”max out that employer match! Treat it like getting a bonus just for showing up. Then, pour in as much as you can manage. It's all about reducing that taxable income while your cash compounds like a champ.
   
2. **IRA**: Smash those contributions! Roth IRAs are the holy grail if you think youâ€™ll be in a higher tax bracket later. Pay taxes now and dodge them later like a ninja! Traditional IRAs can be great too if you need some immediate tax relief.
   
3. **Taxable Accounts**: This is your wild card! Keep it flexible; save it for after-tax investments. Itâ€™s your playground for things like stock dividendsâ€”just remember, taxes hit here when you sell, so keep an eye on capital gains.

In short, load up your tax-advantaged accounts first, but keep some liquidity in taxable for when life throws a curveball!
