To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for funds needing liquidity or for short-term goals. Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains tax.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to balance risk.

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations to maintain your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 20-30% of your total investment contributions
- **IRA**: 10-20%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 50-70% (if you're focusing on liquidity or short-term needs)

### Conclusion
Ultimately, tailor your approach based on your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Regular reviews and adjustments are essential for long-term success.
