   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Based on the condition (e.g., antiviral medications for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases).

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups with blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function.

4. **Weight Management**: 
   - For fatty liver disease, losing weight can significantly improve liver health.

5. **Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like endoscopy or surgery may be needed.

6. **Liver Transplant**:
