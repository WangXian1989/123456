Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money). Consider maxing out if you can.
   - **IRA:** If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, depending on your income.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are useful for short-term goals or if you need liquidity. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing here.

### 3. **Assess Your Investment Goals:**
   - For retirement, prioritize growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. **Maintain Liquidity:**
   - Keep some funds in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs, ensuring you have access without penalties.

### 5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly examine and adjust your allocations based on market performance, tax law changes, and your evolving financial situation.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 10-15% of your income (take advantage of employer match)
- **IRA:** Up to the annual limit ($6,500 for those under 50, $7,500 for 50+)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remaining funds after maximizing the above

### Conclusion
Tailor your distribution based on personal circumstances and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
