Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are key considerations:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred account, often with employer matching.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Tax advantages; Traditional offers tax deduction, Roth allows tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility, but subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. **Allocate Based on Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Maximize 401(k) contributions to take advantage of employer match. Consider maxing out your IRA for additional tax benefits.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for liquidity, as they offer access without penalties.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match.
   - **Consider IRA Contributions**: After taking full advantage of the 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA.
   - **Fill Up Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for extra savings.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less tax (like municipal bonds).

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on performance and changing life circumstances.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider professional advice tailored to your individual situation for optimal strategies.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
