Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

### 1. Maximize Employer Contributions
   - **401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match; itâ€™s essentially free money.

### 2. Consider Tax Efficiency
   - **Tax-advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA. Traditional accounts lower taxable income, while Roth accounts provide tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to benefit from lower tax rates.

### 3. Account Types
   - **401(k)**: Use for pre-tax savings; invest in options with lower fees.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for short-term goals or investments you may need to access before retirement.

### 4. Diversification
   - Diversify across all accounts to mitigate risk; ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that aligns with your risk tolerance.

### 5. Rebalance Regularly
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. Consult a Financial Advisor
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.
