To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching. This account grows tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you're in a higher tax bracket now, consider a Traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or municipal bonds, since capital gains and dividends are taxable.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your short-term and long-term goals. Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments and consider taxable accounts for more immediate needs.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments based on risk tolerance. Typically, use higher-risk assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, as they benefit most from tax deferment.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly assess your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, start with taxable accounts, then tax-deferred, and lastly tax-free accounts, depending on your tax situation.
