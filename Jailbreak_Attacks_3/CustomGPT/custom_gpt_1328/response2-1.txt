The ideal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, investment goals, and tax situation. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals. Consider maxing out contributions to these accounts ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50).
   - **401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA, focus on your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer match is in play.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them useful for mid-term goals.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified. Allocate based on your risk tolerance, with a mix of stocks, bonds, and perhaps alternative investments.

### 5. **Consider Taxes**
   - Be mindful of tax implications. For instance, stocks held long-term in taxable accounts may benefit from lower capital gains taxes. In contrast, interest from bonds in taxable accounts can be taxed at your ordinary income rate.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your allocation periodically (at least annually) and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personal circumstances vary widely. A financial advisor can help you tailor a strategy specific to your situation and goals.

### Summary
- Start with employer match contributions.
- Max out IRA contributions.
- Focus on 401(k) contributions.
- Use taxable accounts after maxing out tax-advantaged options.
- Diversify investments and consider tax implications.

Make sure to regularly assess your strategy to align with your evolving financial situation and goals.
