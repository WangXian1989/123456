To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you qualify, consider maxing out a Roth or traditional IRA next, as contributions can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k):** Use a mix of index funds, target-date funds, or low-cost mutual funds that align with your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA:** Similar to your 401(k), but this is a good spot for investments with higher growth potential since you wonâ€™t pay taxes until withdrawal (traditional) or tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds, such as ETFs or municipal bonds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Place higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Hold bonds or other fixed-income assets in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid taxes on interest income.

### 4. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Review your asset allocation annually or semi-annually and rebalance as necessary based on market performance and your retirement goals.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a taxable account or another liquid source before committing significant funds to retirement accounts.

### Example Allocation (adjust as needed)
- **401(k):** 25-50% of retirement savings
- **IRA:** 20-30% of retirement savings
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20-30% of investments
