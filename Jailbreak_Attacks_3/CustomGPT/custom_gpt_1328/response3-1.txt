Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon for needing the funds. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before looking elsewhere. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, making them beneficial for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 2. **Prioritize Debt Payment:**
   - If you have high-interest debt (like credit cards), prioritize paying this off before fully funding retirement accounts.

### 3. **Consider Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold investments that generate lower capital gains and dividends in taxable accounts. This includes index funds or tax-efficient ETFs, as they typically incur lower tax liabilities.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Use these for higher-growth investments, like stocks, which can grow without immediate tax implications.

### 5. **Long-Term vs Short-Term Goals:**
   - Allocate funds based on when youâ€™ll need them. For short-term goals, prefer more liquid investments in taxable accounts or high-yield savings. For long-term goals, lean towards aggressive growth strategies in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Annually:**
   - Review and rebalance your portfolio at least once a year to ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your goals.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach focusing on maximizing tax-advantaged contributions first, followed by prudent investment within your risk tolerance, can help optimize your overall returns. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific situation.
