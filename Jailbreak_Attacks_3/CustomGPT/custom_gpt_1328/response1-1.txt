To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize your contributions to either a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in this account with a focus on lower capital gains and qualified dividends to minimize taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider using tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Choose a mix of stock and bond funds that align with your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Similar strategy, but you might have a wider range of investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Cash flows might be more flexible here; consider your liquidity needs.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Consider Fees**:
   - Be mindful of any fees associated with the funds in your 401(k) and IRAs and choose options accordingly.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific financial situation.
