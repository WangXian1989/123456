Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
- **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for current tax deduction benefits.

### 2. Assess Your Goals and Timeline
- **Short-term Needs**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for liquidity.
- **Long-term Growth**: Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts first for optimal growth potential.

### 3. Diversify Investments
- **401(k)**: Use a mix of equity and bond funds tailored to your risk tolerance.
- **IRA**: Take advantage of a wider range of investment options, including individual stocks and ETFs.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. Monitor and Adjust
- Regularly review your asset allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions across these accounts strategically can enhance your retirement savings while minimizing tax liabilities. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.
