The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon for retirement. Here are some considerations to guide your decision:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal. Consider maxing out employer matching contributions first.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met. Depending on your tax bracket, you may prefer one over the other.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not offer tax advantages, but they provide flexibility in withdrawals. Consider holding investments with lower turnover and qualified dividends here to minimize tax implications.

2. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified, regardless of the account type. Different accounts can hold different asset classes. For example, you might keep higher-growth investments in a Roth IRA and more conservative investments in a taxable account.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account type. In 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older) and for IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Balance your contributions to maximize tax advantages.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider your projected retirement income and tax rates in retirement. Having a mix of account types can provide flexibility in how you withdraw funds and manage taxes in retirement.

5. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Align your distributions with your short-term and long-term financial goals. If you plan to access funds in the near term, consider keeping them in a taxable account where withdrawals are not penalized.

Ultimately, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy that fits your unique financial situation and goals.
