Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on contributing to your 401(k) and IRA accounts first, especially if you have access to employer matching contributions in your 401(k). This is essentially free money, and maximizing those contributions can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Impact**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax deductions, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Here, you will owe taxes on dividends and interest in the year they're received, and capital gains on any profits when you sell investments. Thus, it's usually beneficial to keep less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or high dividend-paying stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts, while holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or growth stocks) in taxable accounts.

3. **Investment Allocation**: Decide your asset allocation based on your risk appetite. Generally, stocks are suited for long-term growth, while bonds are seen as lower risk. Diversifying across different asset classes can reduce risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, your withdrawal strategy should consider tax implications. It might be advantageous to deplete taxable accounts first, allowing tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review your asset allocation, contributions, and financial goals, and adjust as needed based on changes in your circumstances or tax laws.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about your specific situation, it's wise to consult a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your overall financial picture and retirement goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
