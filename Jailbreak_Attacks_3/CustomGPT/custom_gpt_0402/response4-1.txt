To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before taxable accounts. These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred or tax-free (in the case of Roth IRAs).

3. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you're looking for more investment options than your 401(k) may provide.

4. **Diversification Strategy**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to your taxable account for flexibility and liquidity.

5. **Asset Location**: Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping assets that benefit from long-term capital gains (like stocks) in your taxable account.

6. **Reassess Periodically**: Review and adjust your allocations regularly based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific financial situation and goals.
