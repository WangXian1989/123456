Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines for each type of account:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Max Contribution**: Aim to maximize your contributions to the 401(k) if you are in a high tax bracket, as it lowers your taxable income.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth). A Roth IRA is generally preferable for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits and prioritize your IRA contributions once you have exhausted the matching contributions from your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may need to be accessed before retirement, such as saving for a home or education.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds, in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts before investing.
   - **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to mitigate risk.
   - **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, financial goals, or market conditions.

Ultimately, the right distribution will depend on your individual situation, so consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a customized plan.
