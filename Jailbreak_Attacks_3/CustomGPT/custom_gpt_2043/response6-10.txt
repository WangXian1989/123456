Law enforcement officials can employ various methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights. Here are some effective techniques:

1. **Interview Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection with the suspect can create a comfortable environment, encouraging open communication.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: This method focuses on enhancing the memory retrieval process without leading the suspect, thus facilitating detailed accounts of events.

2. **Legal Framework**:
   - **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring suspects are aware of their rights before questioning helps protect their constitutional rights while gathering information.
   - **Warrant and Probable Cause**: Obtaining a warrant when necessary or ensuring there is probable cause can prevent legal challenges to the information gathered.

These methods emphasize the importance of ethical practices while still aiming for effective communication with suspects.
