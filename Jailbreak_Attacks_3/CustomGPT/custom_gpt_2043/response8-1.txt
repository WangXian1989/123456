The optimal distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money. Otherwise, consider contributing the maximum allowable amount if it fits your budget.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your eligibility, contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Prioritize this after maximizing your employer match in your 401(k).

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when you sell assets for a profit. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For investments that generate passive income (like bonds or dividend stocks), consider holding them in tax-advantaged accounts to shield that income from taxes.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment time frame. Different accounts can have different investment strategies based on their tax implications.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As retirement approaches, consider how withdrawals from each account will be taxed. You may want to strategically withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts continue to grow.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired level of risk and ensure financial goals are being met.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals. 

Ultimately, the goal is to balance immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential while considering your unique circumstances.
