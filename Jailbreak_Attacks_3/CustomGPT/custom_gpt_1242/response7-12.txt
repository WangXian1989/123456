I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. The best approach often depends on the specific condition affecting the liver, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Here are some general options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - A healthy diet low in fats and sugars.
   - Regular exercise.
   - Maintaining a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.
   - Medications to manage symptoms or complications.

3. **Supplements**: 
   - Some people may benefit from antioxidants like milk thistle.

4. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function.

5. **Avoiding Alcohol**: 
   - Total abstinence from alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

6. **Medical Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, options like liver transplant may be necessary.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a tailored treatment plan based on your specific situation.
