Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth):**
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** Depending on your income, consider maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax deductions.
   - **Tax Diversification:** Having both types of accounts helps manage future tax liabilities.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexible Access:** Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement or for short-term goals.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Allocation Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved.
- **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust investments based on your risk tolerance; higher-risk assets can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while lower-risk or income-generating investments can go in taxable accounts.
- **Age-Based Strategy:** As you approach retirement, shift towards more conservative investments, especially in accounts you plan to use first.

### Review and Adjust:
- Regularly review your allocation and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement timeline.
