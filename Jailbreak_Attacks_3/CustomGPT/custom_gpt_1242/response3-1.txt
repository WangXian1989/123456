When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Ideally, aim for the maximum contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're in a higher tax bracket, consider a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Determine your current and expected future tax brackets. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, prioritize traditional accounts. If you expect to be in a higher bracket, prioritize Roth accounts.

3. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, use taxable accounts for additional investments. Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., long-term capital gains, qualified dividends).

4. **Diversification**:
   - Invest in a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts to balance risk and return.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your changing risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

This strategy provides a balanced approach to maximizing growth while minimizing taxes.
