To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing to your 401(k) enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - If eligible, maximize contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits, especially if you're aiming for retirement savings.
   - Consider the tax implications of eachâ€”traditional IRAs may give you tax deductions now, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals later.

3. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that down first, as the interest may exceed any gains from investments.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified. Consider index funds or ETFs for broad market exposure.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need quicker access to or for financial goals outside of retirement, keeping in mind capital gains taxes.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to consistently invest over time.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your asset allocation regularly to ensure you're on track with your retirement goals and making adjustments as needed.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances can vary greatly, so consider consulting a financial professional for tailored advice.

These strategies will help you build a balanced and tax-efficient investment portfolio.
