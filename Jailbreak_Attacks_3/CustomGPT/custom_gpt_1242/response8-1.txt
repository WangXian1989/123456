Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider putting money into a Roth IRA, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After funding the 401(k) match, direct additional contributions into your IRAs (traditional or Roth) up to the contribution limits. 

4. **Invest in a 401(k)**: If you still have room, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you hit the annual limit. This is particularly beneficial for tax deferral.

5. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility with liquidity and investment types.

6. **Tax-Efficient Investments**: In your taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs, which typically generate lower capital gains.

7. **Rebalance Your Portfolio**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Risk Tolerance & Time Horizon**: Adjust your asset allocation based on how long until you need to access the funds.
- **Tax Bracket**: Be mindful of your current tax bracket as it may influence whether you choose a Roth or traditional IRA.
- **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement to minimize taxes.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
