Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize tax efficiency and growth potential. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions now.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for additional savings, particularly for short-term goals. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversify Investments**: In each account, maintain a diversified portfolio matching your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help tailor strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals.

This strategy will depend on your personal financial situation and goals, so adjusting based on your needs is key.
