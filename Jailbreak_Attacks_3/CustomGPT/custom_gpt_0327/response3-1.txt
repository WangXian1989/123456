Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts wisely depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **IRA**: If youâ€™re eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions depending on your income level.
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a savings or money market account.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Balance investments across all accounts. Keep higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.

### 5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might want to access before retirement. They can also be beneficial for tax-loss harvesting.

### 6. **Ongoing Contributions**
   - After maximizing employer matching and contributing to your IRA, continue to invest in your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

### 7. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your portfolio based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

### 8. **Seek Professional Guidance**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced approach that supports your long-term financial security.
