Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions lower your taxable income.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if you qualify), or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for extra savings or short-term goals.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure diverse investment types (stocks, bonds) across all accounts.
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly reassess your portfolio and contributions as your financial situation and goals evolve.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your specific needs.
