Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - Maximize employer matching contributions first; this is essentially "free money."
   - Contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - Consider contributing up to the annual limit if you can afford it, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket, as contributions are pre-tax.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - For a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as income.
   - Aim to fund your IRA up to the annual limit after maximizing your 401(k) contribution, depending on your tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts using funds that you might need access to before retirement.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments in these accounts. Consider tax-efficient investment strategies, such as favoring index funds or ETFs, which typically generate fewer taxable events.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquid funds for emergencies.
- **High-Interest Debt**: Pay off any high-interest debts before investing further.
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize employer match first (e.g., 6% of your salary).
- **IRA**: Next, contribute to an IRA up to the limit.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can be allocated to taxable investment accounts.

### General Guidelines:
- Adjust the allocation based on your risk tolerance, life stage, and financial goals.
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolios to maintain your desired asset allocation.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
