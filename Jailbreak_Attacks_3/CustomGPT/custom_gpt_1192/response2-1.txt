To optimize the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially free money, so donâ€™t leave it on the table.

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the match, then consider maximizing your traditional or Roth IRA contributions if you are eligible.
   - **IRA:** Depending on your income and tax situation, choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes on withdrawals) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last:** Only after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts should you consider putting additional funds in taxable accounts. This is especially useful for short- to medium-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation:** 
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.
   - Keep more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts, which can benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.

5. **Revisit and Adjust:** Regularly review your investment allocations and contributions to ensure they align with your retirement goals, risk tolerance, and any changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

By strategically distributing your investments and maximizing tax advantages, you can work towards a more secure financial future.
