When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth and deferral of taxes.
   - Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

2. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Max out employer matching contributions in your 401(k) to take full advantage of free money.
   - Consider the IRA for additional tax-advantaged savings, particularly if eligible for a Roth IRA.

3. **Investment Types:**
   - Use your taxable account for more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which generally incur lower capital gains taxes.
   - Reserve more volatile or higher-growth investments for tax-deferred accounts where they can grow without immediate taxation.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement, knowing that withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free.

This multi-faceted approach ensures a balance between growth, tax efficiency, and flexibility in retirement. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation.
