To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit, especially if you have a traditional 401(k), since contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider contributing to an IRA. A traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a high-yield savings account.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This allows flexibility and access to funds without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across accounts. For example, holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts can optimize tax liability.

6. **Regular Review**: Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolios to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A personalized strategy that considers your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance can be greatly beneficial.
