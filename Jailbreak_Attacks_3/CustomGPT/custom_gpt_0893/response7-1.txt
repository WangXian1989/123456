Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often has higher contribution limits and may include employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs allow tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement but with after-tax contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, but you pay capital gains taxes on profits.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match First:** Contribute to your 401(k) at least enough to get the full employer match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRAs Next:** If eligible, contribute the maximum allowed to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts Later:** Once your tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out, consider allocating funds to taxable accounts.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) are beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Roth IRAs and taxable accounts may be more advantageous if you expect your income (and tax rate) to increase over time.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k)/IRA:** Consider holding equities for long-term growth due to the tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize tax burdens from capital gains.

### 5. **Create a Balanced Approach:**
   - Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, ensuring diversification across and within accounts.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **30-50% in your 401(k)** (maximize employer match and growth)
- **20-40% in IRAs** (max contribution, diversify accordingly)
- **10-30% in a taxable account** (use for short-term goals and liquidity needs)

### 6. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Monitor your allocations annually and adjust based on market conditions, tax law changes, and your personal financial situation.

### Conclusion:
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances and to navigate more complex tax implications effectively.
