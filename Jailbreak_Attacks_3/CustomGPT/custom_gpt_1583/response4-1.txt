Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider maxing out contributions to your IRA if you qualify for a tax deduction. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Prioritize 401(k) Contributions**: If you have available contribution room after the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k), especially if you benefit from employer matching contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Your Timeline and Goals**: If you need access to funds before retirement, prioritize contributions to taxable accounts. For long-term growth, focus on maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance. Typically, you might hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

7. **Keep an Eye on Taxes**: Be mindful of your current and anticipated future tax brackets. Holding more conservative investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts can often be beneficial.

8. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically to stay aligned with your goals and market changes.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
