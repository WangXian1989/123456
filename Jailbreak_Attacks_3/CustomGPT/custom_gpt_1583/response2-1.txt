To distribute your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; then, consider increasing contributions to the maximum allowed. This reduces your taxable income and allows for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA is especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified. Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments expected to grow the most (like stocks), while using taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-exempt bonds).

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains which are taxed at a lower rate. Avoid high-turnover mutual funds that trigger short-term capital gains taxes.
   - **Asset Location**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts and more stable, income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changes in your financial goals. This helps maintain your desired risk level across all accounts.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside these accounts, covering at least 3-6 months of expenses. This prevents needing to withdraw from your retirement accounts prematurely.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation, investment goals, and risk tolerance.

By employing these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for both growth and tax efficiency.
