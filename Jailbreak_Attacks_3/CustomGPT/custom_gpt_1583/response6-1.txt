Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest here for short-term goals or after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments (like ETFs).

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Higher Growth Investments**: Consider holding these in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on earnings.
   - **Income-Generating Investments**: Such as bonds, may be better suited for taxable accounts to benefit from lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts for accessibility and liquidity.

### 5. **Re-evaluate Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions. 

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.
- Align investments with your tax situation and goals.
- Regularly review and adjust as necessary.
