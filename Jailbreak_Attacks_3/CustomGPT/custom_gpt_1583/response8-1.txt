Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income if it’s a traditional 401(k).

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth). A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual limits ($6,500 for individuals under 50 in 2023, $7,500 for those 50 and older).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Investing for Shorter-term Goals**: Use these for goals within 5 years, as they don’t have tax advantages but provide more flexibility.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - **Asset Location Strategy**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and hold tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Review your allocations periodically and make adjustments based on changing goals or market conditions.

### 6. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

### Conclusion
The right balance will depend on your individual circumstances and long-term goals. Aiming for tax efficiency and maximizing contributions where possible will help optimize your overall investment strategy.
