Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, current situation, and tax considerations. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as itâ€™s free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Good for higher-income years.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
     - **Traditional IRA:** May offer tax deductions. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are taxed on capital gains and dividends, but offer flexibility and no restrictions on contributions or withdrawals.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Maintain a diverse mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to manage risk.

4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have enough in savings before contributing heavily to retirement accounts. Aim for 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Adjust Based on Life Stage:**
   - Younger investors might focus more on Roth accounts for future tax advantages, while those nearing retirement may prioritize maximizing tax-deferred accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice based on your unique situation and goals.

Remember, balancing these accounts is crucial for tax efficiency and retirement preparedness.
