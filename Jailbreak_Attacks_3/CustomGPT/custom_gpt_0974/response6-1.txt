To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts often provide tax benefits (tax-deferred growth for 401(k)s and potentially tax-free growth for Roth IRAs).
   - **Taxable accounts for flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may produce capital gains you can control or for funds you'll need before retirement age.

2. **Investment Types**:
   - **Place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts**: Invest in stocks or funds with high growth potential in your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of their tax benefits over the long term.
   - **Hold income-producing investments in taxable accounts**: Keep bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts, where you can manage tax liabilities on income more easily.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - **Stay informed on annual limits**: Ensure you are aware of contribution limits for each account type to maximize your savings.
   - **Employer match leverage**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

Consider these strategies based on your personal financial situation and retirement goals. It might also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
