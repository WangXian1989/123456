Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize employer match: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit. This is essentially free money.
   - Assess fees: Consider the fees associated with your 401(k) investments, as higher fees can eat into your returns.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Tax considerations: Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - Contribution limits: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for IRAs ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if age 50+).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Flexibility: These accounts can be accessed without penalties before retirement age, making them good for short- to medium-term goals.
   - Tax efficiency: Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs, which typically generate fewer capital gains.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - Emergency savings: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) set aside in a liquid account.
   - Asset allocation: Diversify your investments to spread risk, typically using a mix of stocks and bonds suitable for your risk tolerance.
   - Regular contributions: Consider dollar-cost averaging by making regular contributions to each account type to reduce the impact of market volatility.

5. **Re-evaluate periodically**: Review your asset allocation and contribution strategies at least annually or when you experience significant life changes.

Ultimately, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can offer personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
