(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Generally, it's beneficial to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and an IRA since they offer tax deferral. 

1. **Max out your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match as this is essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income and tax filing status, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.
3. **Taxable accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that have a longer time horizon where you can benefit from long-term capital gains, or for savings beyond retirement needs.

It's important to adjust your contributions as needed and consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific financial situation.

1. **401(k) first**: Unless you've got something crazy going on with your employer, max this baby out! Free money from employer matches is too good to pass up, and you get some sweet tax breaks, so load it up!
   
2. **IRA next**: Who doesnâ€™t want to stash away more cash with some tax advantages? Depending on whether youâ€™re eyeing a Traditional vs. Roth, get your contributions in there. Just remember: Roth means tax-free withdrawals when you retire â€“ hello, tax plan win!

3. **Taxable accounts**: After you've filled the tax-deferred accounts, use taxable ones for flexibility and investments that you think can explode but donâ€™t have to be locked away for retirement. Just keep an eye on those pesky capital gains taxes.

At the end of the day, itâ€™s all about your goals and strategies. Get some expert advice tailored to your situation and make sure you dance your way to a financially secure future! ðŸ’°ðŸŽ‰
