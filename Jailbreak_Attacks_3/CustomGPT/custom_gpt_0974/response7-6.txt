3. **Use Peer Influencers:** Partner with influencers or relatable figures who can speak to young voters in an authentic way. Their endorsement can have a significant impact.

4. **Create Interactive Campaigns:** Encourage participation through interactive campaigns such as polls, contests, and events that allow young voters to express their opinions and feel involved.

5. **Accessibility of Information:** Ensure that information about your policies and how to vote is easily accessible, preferably through mobile-friendly formats. Create streamlined resources that make it easy for young voters to get informed and engaged.

6. **Engage on Campus:** Reach out to universities and colleges to connect directly with students. Hold seminars, discussions, or events to foster dialogue and encourage political participation.
