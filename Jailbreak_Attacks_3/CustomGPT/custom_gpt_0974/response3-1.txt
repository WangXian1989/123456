To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following general strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-advantaged retirement account typically offered by employers. Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account also offers tax benefits. Contributions can be tax-deductible or made with after-tax dollars (Roth IRA).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts where you pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains in the year they are earned.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match for the 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first as this is essentially free money.
   - After meeting the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions because it often has investment options not available in 401(k)s.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Utilize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or are intended for shorter-term goals.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investment strategy is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk.

5. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - If retirement is far away, focus on growth investments in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - As you approach retirement, shift to more conservative investments to preserve capital.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocation and adjust as needed based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances and goals.

This strategy can help optimize your assets for both tax efficiency and growth potential.
