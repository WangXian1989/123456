Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA next. This can provide tax advantages depending on your income level and retirement strategy. 

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Allocation**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, you might want to hold more aggressive assets like stocks in your taxable account due to tax treatment on capital gains.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep tax efficiency in mind. For instance, place tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts and bonds or other income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation can change, so regularly reassess your allocations based on your life changes, market conditions, and financial goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your personal circumstances.
