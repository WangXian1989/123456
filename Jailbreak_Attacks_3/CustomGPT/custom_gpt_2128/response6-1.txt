When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deferral and potential employer matching.
- **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or assets that produce qualified dividends and long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

### 2. Contribution Limits
- **401(k) Contributions**: Take advantage of your employerâ€™s match and try to reach the annual contribution limit.
- **IRA Contributions**: Depending on income levels, contribute to a Roth or a traditional IRA, focusing on tax benefits relevant to your situation.

### 3. Investment Strategy
- **Asset Allocation**: Consider holding more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping lower growth investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, due to tax implications on interest income.

### 4. Withdrawal Strategy
- **Plan for Retirement Withdrawals**: Consider your expected tax bracket in retirement to decide where to draw funds first, mixing withdrawals from all account types strategically.

By balancing these factors, you can optimize your investment growth while managing tax implications effectively.
