I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general suggestions. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options for liver problems often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), medications may be prescribed.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Treatment of Underlying Conditions**: Managing conditions such as diabetes or high cholesterol can help.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures may be required, including liver transplants.

Please reach out to a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your situation.
