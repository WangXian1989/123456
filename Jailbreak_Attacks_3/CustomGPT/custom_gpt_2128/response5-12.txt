I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet, low in fat and sugar.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Limiting or eliminating alcohol intake.

2. **Medications**: 
   - **Antivirals** for viral hepatitis.
   - **Diuretics** for fluid retention.
   - **Supplements** such as vitamin E or others, depending on the condition.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: 
   - Regular liver function tests.
   - Imaging tests to monitor liver health.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
