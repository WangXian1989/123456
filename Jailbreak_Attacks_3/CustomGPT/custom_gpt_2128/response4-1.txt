Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**: If you still have funds available to invest, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This helps reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need access to before retirement, or for investments that may produce favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains).

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Think about the tax implications of each account. Tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) can help grow your assets without immediate taxation, while taxable accounts may expose you to capital gains taxes.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments in each account are diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Regularly reassess your allocations as your financial situation and tax laws change.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
