Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it’s essentially "free money." 
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, which can be beneficial long-term.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Focus on tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) for investments expected to grow significantly to minimize taxes on gains.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate income (like dividends) or for assets that you might need to access before retirement.

### 3. **Diversification of Investments**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance; more aggressive investments can go in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments can be in taxable accounts.
   - **Asset Location:** Place income-generating assets (bonds, REITs) in tax-deferred accounts to shield interest from taxes. Keep growth-oriented investments (stocks) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 4. **Periodic Review**
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Assess your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.
- Use a mix of investments that aligns with your overall strategy.
- Regularly review and adjust as necessary.

This strategy can help maximize growth while minimizing tax liabilities over time. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
