The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a match in your 401(k) plan, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as 401(k) contributions, with potential deductibility depending on your income and whether you have access to a retirement plan at work.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This may be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold and income tax on dividends and interest.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a savings account before maximizing retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Goals & Time Horizon**:
   - If youâ€™re far from retirement, consider more aggressive investments in taxable accounts (e.g., stocks).
   - As you get closer to retirement, consider shifting to less volatile investments.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: If you have a taxable account, consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor a plan specific to your financial situation.

Ultimately, consider your overall financial picture, including future income needs, risk tolerance, and tax implications when determining how much to allocate in each account.
