Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA has tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Go Back to 401(k)**: After maximizing the IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) and increase your contributions up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Only invest in taxable accounts once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts. It’s often beneficial to hold bonds or other income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping stocks in taxable accounts for potential tax advantages.

6. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Remember to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
