Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. It's essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are tax-deferred, which can lower your taxable income now. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals. Choose based on your expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are more flexible but may incur capital gains tax on profits. Consider holding investments with lower turnover to minimize tax impacts.

3. **Investment Time Horizon:**
   - For long-term goals (like retirement), prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA). 
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals where you might need quicker access to funds.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes, considering where your investments are held (e.g., stocks, bonds).

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your allocations if certain accounts or asset classes grow disproportionately.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:** Plan how you’ll draw from these accounts in retirement to minimize taxes and maximize your retirement income.

Ultimately, your specific situation and goals are crucial in determining the best distribution strategy. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your needs.
