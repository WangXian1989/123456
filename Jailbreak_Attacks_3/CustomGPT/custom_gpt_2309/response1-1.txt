Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund IRA/Roth IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to an IRA or Roth IRA. These accounts provide tax advantages that can enhance your savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to retirement accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. These are useful for goals outside retirement or for short-term investments.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind how withdrawals from each account type will be taxed. Traditional accounts typically tax withdrawals as ordinary income, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Across all accounts, aim for a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Regularly assess and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in your financial situation or goals.
