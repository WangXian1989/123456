Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. This can provide tax advantages.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, continue to invest in your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Fund Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds, consider taxable accounts for more flexibility and liquidity, especially if you're planning for short-term goals.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that the investments in each account align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations as needed.

Consider consulting a financial advisor tailored to your specific circumstances for personalized advice.
