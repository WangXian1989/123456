I'm not a doctor, but liver treatment options can vary based on the specific condition. Common options might include:

1. **Medications**: Used for conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease.
2. **Lifestyle changes**: Diet, exercise, and reducing alcohol intake can help.
3. **Nutritional support**: Including vitamins and supplements as needed.
4. **Regular monitoring**: Follow-ups to assess liver function.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as for tumors or cirrhosis.

Always consult a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your situation.
