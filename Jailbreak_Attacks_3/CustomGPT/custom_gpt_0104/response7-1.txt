Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, max out your IRA contributions, especially if you have a Roth option, as withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use traditional accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) for your higher-income years, as contributions reduce your taxable income now.
   - Use Roth accounts (Roth IRA) in lower-income years for tax-free growth.

3. **Build a Taxable Account**:
   - Once you maximize tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable brokerage account for flexibility.
   - This can be useful for short-term goals since it allows for more accessible withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts to balance risk. Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets fits your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations annually based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique circumstances.
