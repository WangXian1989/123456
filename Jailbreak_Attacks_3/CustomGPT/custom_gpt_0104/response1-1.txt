Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA (either traditional or Roth). A Roth is preferable if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions in your retirement accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This offers flexibility and different tax advantages.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Typically, younger investors might have a higher allocation in stocks and gradually shift to bonds as retirement nears.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes, and keep tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in your life or financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored guidance based on your specific situation.
