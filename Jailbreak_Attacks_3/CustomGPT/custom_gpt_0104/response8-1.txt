To optimally distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's free money. Aim for the max contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Max out contributions here too.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering current taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may provide a tax deduction; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for investments that may appreciate but wonâ€™t be accessed until later. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.
   - Hold higher-growth investments (which could generate more taxable events) in tax-deferred accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for proportional withdrawals in retirement, considering tax implications to minimize your overall tax burden.

5. **Regular Review and Adjustments**:
   - Reassess your allocations periodically, especially as your financial situation or tax laws change.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can be beneficial based on your specific circumstances and goals.
