Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you qualify, aim to max out your contributions for tax advantages.

3. **Balance Between Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility to withdraw without penalties and can be beneficial for short- to medium-term goals.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider putting investments that generate high taxes (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and keeping investments with lower tax implications (like long-term stocks) in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalancing and Diversifying**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across accounts to maintain your desired risk level, considering performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, it can be helpful to speak with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, the right strategy will depend on your goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.
