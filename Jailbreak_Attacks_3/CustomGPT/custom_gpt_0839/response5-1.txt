Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your age, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some key considerations for effective allocation:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This account has tax-deferred growth, so it’s beneficial for long-term investments. If you’re under 50, the contribution limit for 2024 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

2. **IRA**: Consider opening a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA will give you a tax deduction upfront, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your income, you might also be able to contribute to both. The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older) for 2024.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for flexibility and financial goals outside of retirement. Interest, dividends, and realized capital gains are taxable, so consider holding investments that produce lower taxable income. Use these accounts for short-term savings or for investments that you may need access to before retirement.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Invest in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth and keep higher-yielding investments in accounts with tax benefits. 

A well-rounded approach focusing on maximizing employer matches, utilizing tax benefits, and considering your goals and timeline will lead to a more effective distribution of your investments.
