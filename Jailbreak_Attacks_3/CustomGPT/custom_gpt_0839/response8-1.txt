Distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering various factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Good for high earners.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also offers potential tax deductions. Contribute if you can deduct the full amount based on income limits.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Ideal for those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Great for flexibility but will be subject to capital gains tax.

### 3. **Emergency Fund in Savings or Taxable Accounts**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund before investing heavily. Taxable accounts offer more liquidity for unexpected expenses.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - Your asset allocation across all accounts should align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Diversify your investments, keeping in mind the different tax treatments.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy in Retirement**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Taxable accounts can be used for immediate needs, while tax-advantaged accounts can be drawn from strategically to minimize tax impact.

### 6. **Rebalance Annually**
   - Periodically review your investment allocation across all accounts to ensure it matches your goals and risk tolerance.

### Conclusion
Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, then consider taxable accounts for additional savings. Tailor the distribution process to your long-term financial plan and tax situation. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice.
