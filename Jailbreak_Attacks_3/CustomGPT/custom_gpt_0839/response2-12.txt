I’m not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about treatments for liver issues. It’s important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, staying hydrated, and maintaining a healthy weight can improve liver health. Avoiding alcohol and reducing salt and sugar intake are also crucial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), medications may be prescribed. For instance, antiviral drugs may be used for viral hepatitis.

3. **Supplements**: Some people benefit from vitamin E or milk thistle; however, it’s essential to discuss these with your doctor first.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Consistent follow-up appointments and liver function tests can help manage your condition effectively.

5. **Surgery or Procedures**: In severe cases, especially with cirrhosis or tumors, surgical options may be considered.

Always consult a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
