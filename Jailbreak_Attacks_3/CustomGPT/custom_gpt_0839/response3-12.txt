I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, antiviral drugs for hepatitis, or medications to reduce liver inflammation may be prescribed.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
3. **Weight Management**: For non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, losing weight can help reduce fat in the liver.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis or tumors, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Consult with a healthcare provider for tailored advice.
