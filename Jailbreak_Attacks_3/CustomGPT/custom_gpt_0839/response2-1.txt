Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed annually if feasible.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits. Choose a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you might need accessible in the short term or for strategies like tax-loss harvesting. Be mindful of capital gains taxes and choose investments with favorable tax treatment, such as index funds or municipal bonds.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are well diversified. Within your tax-advantaged accounts, consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering market performance and changes in your financial situation.

5. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a separate savings account and consider short-term savings goals outside of these accounts.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can optimize how you distribute your money and work towards your financial objectives effectively.
