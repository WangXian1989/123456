Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some guidelines to help you:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed at withdrawal) and a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you know the annual contribution limits for IRAs and try to max out if possible, especially with a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains. Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize taxable events.

### 4. **General Allocation Strategy**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in liquid assets before investing too heavily in retirement accounts.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Assess your risk tolerance and investment horizon to guide your asset allocation (e.g., stocks vs. bonds).
   - **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across various asset classes (equities, fixed income, real estate, etc.) to mitigate risk.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**
   - **Annual Review**: Revisit your asset allocation at least annually or when significant life changes occur (like a career change or family addition).

Overall, the best approach often combines maximization of tax advantages, liquidity considerations, and aligning with long-term financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice to suit your unique financial situation.
