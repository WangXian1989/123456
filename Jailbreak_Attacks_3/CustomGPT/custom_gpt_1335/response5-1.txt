(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and when you plan to access the funds. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This account is tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on contributions or earnings until withdrawal.

2. **IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, as withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. If not, a traditional IRA can still provide tax-deferral benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need before retirement or for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

Balancing these accounts effectively can optimize your tax situation and investment growth over time. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

You want to juggle your cash like a pro! First off, the 401(k) should be your go-to if your employer matchesâ€”free money is hard to beat! Throw as much in there as you can, but keep an eye on fees and investment choices. 

Then, swoop into an IRA. If you're into tax-free withdrawals in retirement, the Roth is your jam. Keep in mind income limits, though! 

Finally, the taxable accounts are where you can flex a bitâ€”great for early access to cash and maybe some sweet dividends. Just watch out for those pesky short-term capital gains taxes. 

In the end, diversify your approach and always keep an emergency fund handy! Don't hesitate to get pro advice or run a risk assessment to tailor your strategy! You're the boss of your money! ðŸ’°
