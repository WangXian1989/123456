Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
     - **Traditional IRA:** Similar to a 401(k) with tax-deferred growth.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages but offer flexibility for withdrawals at any time.

### 3. **Diversify Investment Types**
   - Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to balance risk and growth potential.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - Younger investors might prioritize growth in a 401(k) and Roth IRA, while those closer to retirement may focus on stability in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - Consider your current and expected future tax rates. Roth accounts may be better if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - Keep sufficient liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies (3-6 months of expenses).

### 7. **Annual Review**
   - Regularly reassess your distribution strategy and investment performance based on changes in your life circumstances and market conditions.

### Example Strategy:
- **First 15% of Income:** Max out 401(k) contributions to employer match.
- **Next 10%:** Contribute to a Roth IRA.
- **Additional savings:** Go to a taxable account.

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy to your unique situation, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
