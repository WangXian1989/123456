Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Maximize IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you qualify, as they offer tax advantages. 

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Since these accounts grow tax-deferred, prioritize investments with higher expected returns here to maximize tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: For investments that might generate a lot of short-term capital gains or ordinary income (like bonds), consider holding those in tax-advantaged accounts instead.

### 3. **Investment Type:**
   - **Equities**: Generally beneficial to hold in tax-deferred accounts due to their long-term growth potential and favorable capital gains tax treatment.
   - **Bonds**: May be more suitable for tax-advantaged accounts, as interest income is taxed as ordinary income.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for how and when youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement, considering tax implications. Taxable accounts can be beneficial for early withdrawals without penalties.

### 5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Keep riskier investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically assess your allocation and rebalance as needed based on your changing financial goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion:
A well-rounded approach often involves maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first, then using taxable accounts for flexibility. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your circumstances.
