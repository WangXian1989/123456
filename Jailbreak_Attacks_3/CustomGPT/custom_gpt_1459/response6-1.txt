To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Often provides employer matching contributions; contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax-deferred growth or tax-free growth if it's a Roth IRA, but has contribution limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No contribution limits, but capital gains and dividends are taxed.

### 2. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive your employer's full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out your IRA contributions (if applicable) after employer match, as they offer significant tax benefits.
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Consider your age, risk tolerance, and when you plan to withdraw funds. Younger investors might prefer more aggressive allocations in their 401(k) and IRAs, placing more of their investments in stocks.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Hold Bonds and REITs in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: These typically generate higher taxable income. Stocks that appreciate should be held in taxable accounts to benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates.
   - **Utilize Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Regularly monitor and sell losing investments in taxable accounts to offset gains.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Allocate 50% of your contributions here, especially if you're receiving a company match.
- **IRA**: Invest an additional 25% in an IRA to maximize tax advantages.
- **Taxable Account**: Use the remaining 25% for investments that may provide quicker access to funds without penalties.

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations annually based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and life changes.
