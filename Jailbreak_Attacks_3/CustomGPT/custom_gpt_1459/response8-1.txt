To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options available in each account type. Here’s a structured approach to help you optimize your distribution:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with tax-deferred growth. Contributions may lower your taxable income, and some employers offer matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth in retirement). Contribution limits and tax implications vary.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments outside retirement accounts. Capital gains taxes apply, but they offer flexibility, including access to funds without penalties.

### 2. **Establish Your Goals**:
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term Goals**: If you’re saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, consider taxable accounts due to their liquidity.

### 3. **Contribute to 401(k) First**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money).
   - Consider the maximum contribution limit if it aligns with your retirement goals.

### 4. **Max Out IRA Contributions Next**:
   - If eligible, max out your IRA contributions, especially if you can take advantage of a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 5. **Prioritize Taxable Accounts After Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - If you have additional funds after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, consider contributing to taxable accounts for flexibility and diversification.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Investment Types**: Place tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (e.g., stocks) in taxable accounts.
   - **Withdrawal Strategies**: Consider your tax bracket and future income when deciding which accounts to draw from in retirement.

### 7. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your account allocations and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 8. **Consider Consulting a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your unique situation, helping you optimize your strategy.

### Summary:
Begin by contributing to your 401(k) to get any available match, followed by maxing out your IRA contributions. Afterward, utilize taxable accounts for additional investments. Always take into account your financial goals, tax implications, and the nature of the investments within each account. Regularly review your allocations to ensure they meet your evolving needs.
