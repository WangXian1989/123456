Certainly! To optimize your investment strategy among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

### 1. Understand Tax Implications
- **401(k):** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which may reduce your taxable income for the year. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal during retirement.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** 
  - **Traditional IRA:** Tax-deferred growth, with contributions potentially tax-deductible.
  - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after taxes, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. Interest, dividends, and short-term capital gains are taxed at ordinary income rates.

### 2. Prioritize Account Types
- **Max Out Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match before investing in other accounts. This is essentially “free money.”
- **Contribute to IRA:** Once you’ve maxed out the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax-advantaged growth. Roth IRAs can be particularly beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any additional investments can be directed to taxable accounts. This can be beneficial for flexibility and accessing funds before retirement age without penalties. 

### 3. Asset Allocation Strategies
- **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Hold investments in taxable accounts that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs with low turnover rates to minimize capital gains taxes. Interest-generating assets (like bonds) are typically better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:** Ensure your assets are distributed across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. 

### 4. Rebalance Regularly
- Periodically review your investments and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. This can help mitigate risk and align your investments with your financial goals.

### Conclusion
The best way to distribute your money will depend on your specific financial situation, goals, and timeline. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
