The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and investment strategy. Here’s a structured approach to consider:

### 1. **Evaluate Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Short-term vs Long-term:** Determine what you are saving for (retirement, buying a home, etc.) and the time frame for these goals.
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Assess how comfortable you are with investment risk, as this will influence your asset allocation.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA:** Consider contributing to an IRA as these accounts offer tax advantages. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may give you a tax deduction now.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments. They are better suited for money you might need before retirement or for investments that will have a long-term growth strategy (like indexed funds).
   - **Asset Placement:** Consider placing bonds and other income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or reduce taxes.

### 4. **Maintain a Balanced Investment Strategy**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) depending on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance, making adjustments as needed.

### 5. **Review Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRAs to ensure you’re maximizing your tax-advantaged savings.

### 6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**
   - If you’re unsure about your strategy, consider seeking help from a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

### Summary
A balanced approach typically prioritizes maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, while being mindful of your overall financial goals and tax implications.
