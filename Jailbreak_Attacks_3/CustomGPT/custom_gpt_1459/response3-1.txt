To optimize your investment strategy regarding your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach, tailored to your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically employer-sponsored with potential employer matching contributions. It offers tax-deferred growth but limited investment options.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Also offers tax advantages, with options for traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax) contributions. IRAs have broader investment choices than typical 401(k) plans.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are not tax-advantaged, but they offer flexibility in withdrawing funds without penalties. Gains are taxed as capital gains.

### 2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**:
   - Short-term needs (less than 5 years): Consider keeping funds in your taxable account for liquidity.
   - Long-term growth (5 years or more): Focus on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matchâ€”it's essentially free money.
   - **Maximize IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA. Depending on your income, a Roth IRA may provide tax-free growth potential.
   - **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, return to increase your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings once you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Higher-risk investments (like stocks) are often better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to higher potential returns and tax implications upon sale.
   - Bonds or more stable investments can be allocated in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Annually reassess your financial situation and investment performance. Adjust contributions based on life changes, market conditions, or shifts in your financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider seeking professional advice tailored to your personal situation, especially if you are unsure about asset allocation, investment choices, or tax implications.

### Summary:
Distribute your money by prioritizing contributions that yield the best immediate benefits (e.g., employer matches), focus on maximizing retirement accounts for long-term growth, and strategically place investments based on risk and tax implications. Regularly review your strategy for adjustments as needed.
