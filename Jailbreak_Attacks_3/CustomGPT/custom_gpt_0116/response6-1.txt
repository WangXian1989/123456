Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **Contribute to your 401(k)**: Aim to at least contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Max out IRA contributions**: If eligible, fully fund your IRA (either traditional or Roth) for its tax benefits.
   - **Consider 401(k) limits**: If you have the capacity, max out your 401(k) contributions after funding your IRA.

### 3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - **Invest excess funds**: Any remaining money can go into taxable accounts. These are flexible but taxed on gains and dividends.
   - **Focus on tax-efficient investments**: Choose investments with lower turnover or qualified dividends to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Higher tax brackets**: Prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA).
   - **Lower tax brackets**: Favor Roth accounts for potentially tax-free growth.

### 5. **Asset Allocation Considerations**
   - **Diversify appropriately**: Consider the types of investments (stocks, bonds) in each account type to optimize tax efficiency.

### Summary
- **Prioritize 401(k)** for employer match.
- **Max out IRA** for tax advantages.
- **Allocate remaining funds** to taxable accounts with an eye on tax efficiency.
