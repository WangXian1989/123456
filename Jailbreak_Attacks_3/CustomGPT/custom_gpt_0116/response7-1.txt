The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k); contributions may be tax-deductible.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, offering tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are subject to capital gains taxes, which can affect your long-term returns.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Aim for a diversified portfolio across accounts. Within each account, diversify among asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and timeline.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in liquid, easily accessible savings before allocating too much to investment accounts.

### 5. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account type (e.g., 401(k) limits, IRA limits) and adjust your contributions accordingly.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Think about your withdrawal strategy in retirement, which can impact how you might want to prioritize contributions now.

### Sample Distribution Strategy
- **First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **Next**: Max out your IRA contributions (preferably Roth if eligible).
- **Then**: Contribute more to the 401(k) or invest in taxable accounts as appropriate for additional growth.
