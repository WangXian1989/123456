Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is free money!

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now. Good for higher earners.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid, easily accessible account before maxing out retirement accounts.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. Use them for goals less than 5 years away, or if you want access to funds without penalties.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts.

### 6. **Regularly Rebalance**
   - Periodically rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of salary (enough to get the match)
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if possible ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 for 2024)
- **Taxable Account**: Any remaining funds after the above

### Final Tips
- Consult a financial advisor for a tailored strategy.
- Review your allocations annually to adjust based on life changes and market conditions.

This approach can help optimize your savings while considering tax implications and personal goals.
