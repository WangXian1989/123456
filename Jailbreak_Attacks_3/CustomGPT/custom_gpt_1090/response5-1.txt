When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year. If your employer offers matching contributions, make sure to contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: Contributions to a Traditional IRA may also be tax-deductible, whereas a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and expected future tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can provide more flexibility for withdrawals but don’t offer the same tax benefits. They’re good for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing money before retirement.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across different asset classes within each account. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to manage risk and enhance potential returns.

3. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep cash or more liquid investments in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies. Retirement accounts typically have penalties for early withdrawals.

4. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you’re far from retirement, focus on maximizing contributions to the accounts with the most significant tax advantages. As you approach retirement, you may want to balance the accounts more to ensure availability of funds.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each type of account to maximize tax benefits.

6. **Financial Goals**:
   - Align your distribution strategy with your financial goals, such as buying a home, funding education, or retirement.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your unique financial situation and goals.
