When considering how to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to think about several factors including your tax situation, investment goals, and timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) & IRA)**: Focus on long-term growth investments (e.g., stocks) since you won’t be accessing these funds for many years.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or stocks held long-term (to benefit from lower capital gains taxes).

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - In higher tax brackets, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. In lower brackets, you might have more flexibility to invest in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Emergency Funds and Short-Term Goals**
   - Ensure you have adequate liquid savings before heavily investing in less accessible accounts.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Balance your portfolio for risk across all accounts. Make sure to adjust periodically based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Summary
- **Maximize employer 401(k) match and contribute to IRAs.**
- **Prioritize long-term growth in retirement accounts; use taxable for flexibility.**
- **Be mindful of tax implications when investing across different accounts.**
