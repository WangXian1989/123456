Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Max out employer match**: If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.
   - **Consider contribution limits**: In 2024, you can contribute up to $23,000 if you’re under 50, and $30,500 if you’re 50 or older.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose between Traditional and Roth**: Traditional IRAs give you a tax deduction now, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider which tax scenario works best for you.
   - **Contribution limits**: For 2024, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for flexibility**: Taxable accounts let you access funds without penalties before retirement age. They’re also good for investments beyond retirement savings.
   - **Diversify investments**: Use this account for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Prioritize 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match.
2. **Fund your IRA**: Max out your IRA contributions (if eligible) after reaching your 401(k) match.
3. **Finish with Taxable Accounts**: Once both retirement accounts are funded, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional savings and investment opportunities.

### Considerations:
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) and more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.
- **Investment Strategy**: Assess your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals to decide on the right mix.
