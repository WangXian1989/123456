Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach you can consider:

### 1. Maximize Employer Contributions
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Contributions are made pre-tax (401(k)) or tax-deductible (traditional IRA), reducing your taxable income in the contribution year.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Gains are taxable in the year they are realized, with different rates for dividends and capital gains.

### 3. Balance Contributions
- **401(k):** After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to your IRA for further tax-deferred growth.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth, while a traditional IRA offers tax deduction benefits.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings once you’re maxing out tax-advantaged accounts or for funds you might need sooner.

### 4. Diversify Investments
- Balance your investment options between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on risk tolerance and time until retirement.

### 5. Review and Adjust
- Regularly review your contribution strategy and adjust as needed based on market conditions, life changes, and retirement targets.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your specific situation and goals.
