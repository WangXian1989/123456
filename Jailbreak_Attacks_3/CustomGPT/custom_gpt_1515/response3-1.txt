To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, growing tax-deferred until withdrawal. Most beneficial for high-earners due to tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible (traditional) or tax-free during retirement (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax upon selling assets, as well as taxation on dividends and interest.

2. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Generally have penalties for early withdrawal before age 59½.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Provide greater flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Understand the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Ensure you maximize employer matching contributions in your 401(k) first.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If you’re investing for a long-term goal, higher-risk investments may be more appropriate in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Short-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing income-generating assets (e.g., bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax exposure.
   - Place higher growth assets (e.g., stocks) in taxable accounts where capital gains can be taxed at lower rates.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Maximize Employer Contributions in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match, as this is free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, aim to max out your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
3. **Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for any additional investments, particularly if you’ve reached contribution limits for tax-advantaged accounts.

### Example:
- If you're able to invest $20,000:
   - $10,000 in 401(k) to maximize employer match.
   - $5,000 in a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - $5,000 in a taxable account for flexibility.
