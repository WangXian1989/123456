The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax Contributions**: Most 401(k) plans allow pre-tax contributions, which can reduce your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA** (Traditional or Roth):
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider prioritizing it for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits (e.g., $6,500 for IRAs in 2023, plus an extra $1,000 if you're over 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may be needed in the short-term or for flexibility without penalties.
   - **Tax Strategy**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution:
- **Max out 401(k)** to take advantage of the employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA**, prioritizing a Roth if eligible.
- **Invest in taxable accounts** for additional savings, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Age**: Younger individuals might favor a Roth IRA for longer-term growth, while those nearing retirement may focus more on 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions.
- **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

This approach allows for both tax-deferred growth and access to funds when needed, balancing short and long-term financial goals.
