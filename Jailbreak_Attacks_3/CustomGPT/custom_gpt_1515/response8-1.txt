Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering factors such as tax advantages, investment goals, and your overall financial situation. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Traditional accounts give you tax deductions now, while Roth accounts let your investments grow tax-free. Consider your current vs. expected future tax rate when deciding.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are suitable for investments you might need to access before retirement. They also allow for more flexibility in withdrawal strategies, such as tax-loss harvesting.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts, tailoring the risk to your age, time horizon, and risk tolerance.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Keep track of your asset allocation in each account and rebalance periodically to maintain your desired level of risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, tax-free accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're uncertain, working with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes your savings potential and minimizes tax liabilities.
