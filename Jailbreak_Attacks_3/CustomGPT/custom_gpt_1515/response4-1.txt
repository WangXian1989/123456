Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is effectively free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions if your goal is to save aggressively for retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Assess your tax bracket to decide which IRA type benefits you more.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), investing in taxable accounts can provide more flexibility.
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments or if you expect to need access to funds before retirement.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Ensure each account includes a mix of equities and bonds according to your risk tolerance.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of your investments. For instance, holding municipal bonds in taxable accounts might yield tax-free interest, while more tax-inefficient investments (like high-turnover mutual funds or REITs) might be better placed in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your financial goals.

Ideal distribution may vary widely, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
