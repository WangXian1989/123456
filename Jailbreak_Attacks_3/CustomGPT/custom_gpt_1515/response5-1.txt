(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Generally, it is advisable to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as that’s essentially “free money.” After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider investing in a traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages. Any additional savings can then be placed in a taxable account for flexibility. It’s also important to periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your risk tolerance and market conditions.
