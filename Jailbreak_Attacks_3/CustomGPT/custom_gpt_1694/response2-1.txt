Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to help you decide:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Usually offers employer matching contributions, has higher contribution limits, but may have limited investment options.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs allow tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Contribution limits are lower than 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Provide flexibility and access to your money at any time, but capital gains and dividends are subject to taxes.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Max out your employer match in 401(k)**: This is essentially free money and a great return on investment.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Return to 401(k)**: After maximizing the IRA, consider contributing more to your 401(k) until you reach the maximum contribution limit.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - The tax implications differ between accounts. For high-income earners, looking into a Roth IRA or utilizing after-tax contributions to your 401(k) may be beneficial for long-term tax savings.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts to mitigate capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Typically, you might hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k)/IRA) while keeping conservative investments (like bonds or cash) in taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - Use tax-efficient funds (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains distributions.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically assess your account allocations and make adjustments based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial goals or circumstances.

6. **Long-term Planning**:
   - As you approach retirement, start shifting assets towards more conservative investments, particularly in taxable accounts, where capital gain taxes may affect your withdrawals.

By considering these factors, you can effectively distribute your contributions across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts based on your individual financial situation and objectives. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
