Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Benefits**: Often has employer matching contributions, which is essentially free money. Contributions are pre-tax (or Roth, if offered), reducing your taxable income.
   - **Strategy**: Maximize contributions up to the employer match. If possible, try to contribute the annual limit to take full advantage of tax benefits and employer contributions.

2. **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid on withdrawals during retirement. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Strategy**: If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement than it is now, consider a Roth IRA. If you want to lower your current tax bill, a Traditional IRA may be more beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Benefits**: Flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, and potential tax benefits on long-term capital gains.
   - **Strategy**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### General Distribution Guidelines:
- **Prioritize the 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match; it's usually the best first step.
- **Consider IRAs Next**: If you're eligible, contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) based on your tax situation.
- **After Tax-advantaged Accounts**: Any additional funds can go into taxable accounts for added flexibility.

### Adjust Based on Your Situation:
- **Age**: If you are younger and can afford to take more risks, consider a higher allocation in stocks in these accounts.
- **Time Horizon**: The longer you have until retirement, the more you can allocate to higher-risk investments.
- **Tax Bracket**: Your current and anticipated future tax brackets can heavily influence whether to use pre-tax (401(k), Traditional IRA) or post-tax (Roth IRA) accounts.

Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial picture.
