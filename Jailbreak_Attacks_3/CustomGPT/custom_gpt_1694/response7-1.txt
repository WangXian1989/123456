When it comes to distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors need to be considered, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - Start with your **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially "free money."
   - Next, consider your **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Depending on your income, you may want to open a traditional IRA (which could provide a tax deduction) or a Roth IRA (where your withdrawals in retirement are tax-free).

2. **Diversify Contributions:**
   - Once you have maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, look to allocate funds to taxable accounts. Having money in taxable accounts can provide liquidity and flexibility, as well as potential tax advantages through strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

3. **Consider Your Investment Horizon:**
   - If you are closer to retirement, favor your tax-advantaged accounts, as they are intended for long-term growth.
   - If you have a longer time horizon, you might choose to allocate more to your taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates on long-term investments.

4. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - Contributing to a traditional 401(k) or IRA can lower your taxable income now but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - Roth accounts donâ€™t give a tax break when contributing, but they grow tax-free and are not taxed upon withdrawal, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

5. **Maintain Flexibility:**
   - Having a combination of accounts provides flexibility in drawing down funds in retirement. For example, if your taxable accounts have lower tax consequences in a given year, you may choose to withdraw from them to keep your tax load manageable.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Given the complexities of tax laws and personal financial situations, consulting a financial advisor can assist you in crafting a more tailored strategy.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to your investment strategy that considers both growth and tax efficiency.
