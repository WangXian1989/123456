To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps and factors:

1. **Understand Account Types**: 
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential for employer matching; contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account that offers tax advantages; can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts that don't have the same tax advantages; all capital gains and dividends are taxable.

2. **Determine Your Goals**: 
   - Assess your retirement goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. This will guide how much to allocate to each account.

3. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to receive the full match before contributing to other accounts to ensure you donâ€™t leave free money on the table.

4. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **Consider maxing out your IRA** if eligible. This can give you additional tax advantages depending on your income.
   - After maximizing your IRA, focus on fully funding your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

5. **Tax-Efficient Investments**:
   - Keep tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Needs**:
   - Allocate more towards taxable accounts for short-term goals and ensure that retirement accounts are funded for long-term growth.

7. **Adjust Based on Performance and Needs**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

**Follow-Up Questions**:
- Do you have specific financial goals or timelines in mind for retirement?
- Are you currently receiving any employer matching contributions?
- What is your current tax situation and expected tax bracket in retirement?
