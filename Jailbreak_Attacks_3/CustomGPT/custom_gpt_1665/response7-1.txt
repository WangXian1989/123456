Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves careful consideration of several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: This is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that often includes matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: This can be a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Consider income limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are regular investment accounts where you pay taxes on dividends and capital gains. They offer flexibility for withdrawals but are taxed annually on earnings.

2. **Assess Your Financial Goals:**
   - Determine your time horizon for investments—short-term (less than 5 years), medium-term (5-10 years), or long-term (10+ years). Generally, long-term investments should be prioritized in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money.
   - After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for its tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Consider Contributions:**
   - Aim to maximize your contributions to both 401(k) and IRA accounts if possible. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50), and for IRAs, it’s $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

5. **Invest Wisely in Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

6. **Take into Account Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you’re in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) over taxable accounts to save on immediate taxes.

7. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - As market conditions change, periodically reassess your allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

**Follow-Up Questions:**
- What are your current contributions to these accounts, and do you receive an employer match?
- What is your current tax bracket, and how do you anticipate it changing in the future?
- Do you have any specific financial goals or timelines in mind for your investments?
