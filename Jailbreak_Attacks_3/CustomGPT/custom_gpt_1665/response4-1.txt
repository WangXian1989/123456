To provide the best guidance on how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s important to consider several factors including your current income, tax situation, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Here's a step-by-step approach to help you make a decision:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - *401(k):* Typically funded through pre-tax contributions, which may lower your taxable income. Employer matches can add to your contributions. 
   - *IRA (Individual Retirement Account):* Can be a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth) or Roth IRA (tax-free growth in retirement). 
   - *Taxable Accounts:* Subject to taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains but provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals.

2. **Evaluate Your Goals:**
   - Determine your retirement age, expected expenses in retirement, and other financial goals (e.g., buying a house, funding education).

3. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - For 2023, the maximum contribution to a 401(k) is $22,500 (with an additional $7,500 for those over 50). For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 (with a $1,000 catch-up for those over 50).

4. **Tax Implications:**
   - Max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (like your 401(k) and IRA) before contributing to taxable accounts, as this can help reduce your tax liability.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more advantageous.

5. **Diversification Strategies:**
   - Keep your investments diversified. Consider your risk tolerance and invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk profile across all accounts.

6. **Review Investment Options:**
   - The 401(k) plan may have limited investment options. Look for those with low fees and good historical performance.
   - Choose investments in your IRA and taxable accounts that can maximize tax efficiency.

7. **Periodic Review:**
   - Regularly assess and readjust your allocations based on market conditions, life events, and changes in your financial situation or goals.

**Follow-Up Questions:**
- What is your current age, and at what age do you plan to retire?
- Do you have employer matching contributions for your 401(k)?
- Are you currently contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA?
- What is your risk tolerance (conservative, moderate, aggressive)?
- Do you have any specific financial goals apart from retirement? 

Answering these questions can help me provide a more tailored distribution strategy for your accounts.
