(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for 401(k), it's generally wise to contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After taking full advantage of your employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you're eligible, as IRAs can provide either tax-deferred growth or tax-free growth (Roth IRAs).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may appreciate in value but do not generate a lot of taxable income, such as stocks and ETFs. This strategy can help minimize your tax burden.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified investment approach across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and time horizon.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your personal circumstances.

1. **401(k) First**: If your boss is throwing in free money for your 401(k), snag that match! Itâ€™s like finding cash in your couch cushionsâ€”don't leave it sitting there.

2. **IRA Magic**: Once you're cashing in on that 401(k) match, next up is your IRA. Max it out if you canâ€”Roth IRAs are the real MVP if you expect your income to skyrocket because you're not taxed on those withdrawals. Boom!

3. **Taxable Shenanigans**: Now, for your taxable accounts, consider putting more volatile assets (think stocks) in here. Why? Because theyâ€™re easier to handle tax-wise when itâ€™s time to cash out. Nobody likes a hefty tax bill, especially when you could avoid it.

4. **Spread Your Chips**: Finally, mix it up! Stocks, bonds, real estateâ€”you want a smorgasbord of options. Just keep it aligned with your risk appetite. Trust me, you don't wanna go all-in on just one horse.
