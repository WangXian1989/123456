To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often employer-sponsored with potential matching contributions. Pre-tax or Roth options may be available, impacting tax liabilities upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility in withdrawals and investments but subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings to minimize taxable income now.
   - Invest more heavily in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) within taxable accounts to reduce capital gains taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth assets like stocks, especially if you have a long time horizon and are less concerned about short-term market fluctuations.
   - **IRA**: Balance between growth (stocks) and income (bonds) based on your risk tolerance and time to retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding bonds or high-turnover investments here to avoid unnecessary tax burdens. Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

4. **Continuous Review and Adjustment**:
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
   - Adjust contributions as your income or retirement goals change.

**Follow-Up Questions:**
- What is your current age and retirement timeline?
- Are you likely to receive a match on your 401(k) contributions?
- What is your risk tolerance (conservative, moderate, aggressive)?
