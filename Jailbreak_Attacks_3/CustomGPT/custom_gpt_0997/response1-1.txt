To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, aim to maximize your IRA contributions, since these accounts offer tax benefits.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Understand Your Tax Situation**: Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA reduce your taxable income now, while contributions to a Roth IRA and withdrawals from these accounts in retirement are tax-free. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Investment Options**: 401(k) plans often have limited investment options. If your employer's plan has high fees or poor choices, consider prioritizing IRA contributions, which provide a broader range of investment options.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure you have a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Assess Liquidity Needs**: Funds in taxable accounts are more accessible without penalty than those in retirement accounts. If you anticipate needing funds soon, allocate more to your taxable accounts.

7. **Plan for Retirement Withdrawals**: Think about how you'll withdraw money in retirement. Distributing funds aimed at minimizing taxes during retirement can influence how you allocate funds now.

It's often advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
