The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After taking full advantage of any employer match, focus on maxing out contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) and your 401(k) if you haven't reached the annual contribution limits.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until you withdraw in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when you sell. Use these for savings goals that are shorter-term or for retirement in the case of needing funds before traditional retirement age.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Investment Horizon**: Spread your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance. For longer-term investments (like retirement), you may want to have a higher percentage in equities due to their growth potential.

5. **Rebalance and Adjust**: Regularly review and rebalance your allocations based on performance, life changes, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, consider consulting a financial professional who can help create a strategy that fits your needs.

Always ensure that your investments align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
