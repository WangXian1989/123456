I'm not a doctor, but the best course of action for liver problems can vary widely depending on the specific condition and severity. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Common treatment options might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to address specific complications or conditions affecting the liver.

Always seek personalized medical advice tailored to your specific situation from a healthcare provider.
