I'm sorry to hear that you're having liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. However, generally, treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and exercising regularly can significantly improve liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function is crucial.
4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Staying away from substances that can harm the liver, including certain medications and environmental toxins.
5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be considered if the liver is severely damaged.

It's essential to work closely with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
