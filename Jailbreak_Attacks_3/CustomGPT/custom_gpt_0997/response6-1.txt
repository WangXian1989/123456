When considering how to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should think about several key factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income, and grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax deferral benefits with additional options for tax-deductible or Roth contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages but provide flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-term growth**: Prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA for retirement due to their tax benefits.
   - **Short-term needs**: Allocate more funds to taxable accounts to avoid penalties for early withdrawals.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type and match your contributions accordingly to maximize tax benefits.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

**Suggested Allocation Strategy**:
- Allocate enough to your 401(k) to meet any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
- Max out your IRA contributions if possible, especially if you're eligible for a tax deduction.
- Invest any remaining funds in a taxable account for liquidity and flexibility.

Always consult with a financial advisor for a strategy tailored to your specific financial goals and circumstances.
