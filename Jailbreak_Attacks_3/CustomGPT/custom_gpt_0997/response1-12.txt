I'm not a doctor, but there are several common treatment options for liver problems, including lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol. Medications may be prescribed depending on the specific liver condition, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis. In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.
