To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Prioritize contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. Max out your IRA contributions if eligible, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA which offers tax-free growth.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k):** Focus on a mix of investment options that align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - **IRA:** Consider diversifying with different asset classes. Roth IRAs can be ideal for younger investors expecting higher future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that aren't tax-efficient in tax-advantaged accounts, such as stocks or tax-efficient mutual funds.

4. **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of tax implications. Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed as income, while capital gains in taxable accounts can be taxed at favorable rates if held long enough.

5. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly assess your allocation based on your financial goals, market conditions, and changes in your situation.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
