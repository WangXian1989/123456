Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, which may be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Tax Considerations**: Allocate investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to reduce your taxable income. Conversely, keep investments that appreciate in value (like stocks) in taxable accounts, allowing you to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diverse investment portfolio across all accounts to spread risk. Consider different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate).

5. **Retirement Timeline**: The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative you may want to be with your investments. Adjust your allocations accordingly.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio based on market performance and any changes in your financial situation or goals.

7. **Consult a Professional**: A financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced investment strategy tailored to your needs.
