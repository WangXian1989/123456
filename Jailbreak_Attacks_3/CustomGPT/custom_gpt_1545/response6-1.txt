To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maxing out your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Current vs. Future Tax Rates:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)).
   - **Tax Diversification:** Maintain a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts.

### 3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts:**
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) that generate minimal taxable income.
   - Use strategies like tax-loss harvesting to offset gains and minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Balance Liquidity Needs:**
   - Ensure enough funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies, as withdrawal penalties apply to retirement accounts.

### Conclusion:
Every individualâ€™s situation is unique, so assess your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to optimize your investment distribution.
