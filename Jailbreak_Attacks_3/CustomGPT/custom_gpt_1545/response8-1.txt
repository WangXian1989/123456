To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match (this is free money).
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if eligible.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, which means you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal. It's beneficial for higher-income years.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether itâ€™s a traditional or Roth IRA, your tax strategy will differ. Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for investments you might need to access sooner or for tax-efficient investments like index funds or tax-managed funds.

3. **Investment Types**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Assess Risk Tolerance**:
   - Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance, often adjusted based on the account type.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy early, considering age and tax implications. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-advantaged accounts, to manage tax brackets.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustments**:
   - Frequently review your allocations and adjust as your financial situation and market conditions change.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific situation.
