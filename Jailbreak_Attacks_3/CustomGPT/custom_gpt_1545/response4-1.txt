Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - **Employer Match**: Max out contributions to receive any employer match, as it's essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free if you meet qualifications.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits and eligibility based on income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Money here can be accessed anytime without penalties, making it a good option for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Implications**: Capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments, so consider holding investments long-term to minimize taxes.

### Suggested Approach:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing heavily.
- **Prioritize Accounts**:
  - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
  - Fund your IRA (consider a Roth if you expect higher future income).
  - After maximizing these tax-advantaged accounts, invest additional funds in your taxable account for flexibility.

### Rebalancing:
- Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
- It's beneficial to speak with a financial advisor to tailor an investment strategy that fits your unique circumstances.
