To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. This will influence how you allocate funds across different accounts.

2. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, maximize this benefit first. Contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Consider IRA Accounts**: Depending on your eligibility, contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and future expectations.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing retirement account contributions, consider using taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement age. These are also great for short-term goals.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Across all accounts, maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. This could include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of each account type. For example, investment income in taxable accounts could be subject to capital gains taxes, while withdrawals from traditional accounts will be taxed as ordinary income.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your life circumstances, market conditions, or changes in your financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategy for your specific situation, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor to tailor a plan that suits your needs.

This approach will help you build a well-rounded investment strategy while maximizing tax advantages and preparing for your financial future.
