The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your income, financial goals, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough to get the full match** offered by your employer. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If you can, contribute to a **Roth or Traditional IRA**. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions, depending on your income level.

### 3. **Evaluate Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable accounts** are less tax-advantaged than retirement accounts. Consider holding investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or ETFs, in these accounts.

### 4. **Consider Long-Term vs. Short-Term Needs**
   - Money in retirement accounts is generally for long-term goals. For shorter-term needs, prioritize a taxable account where you might need more flexibility.

### 5. **Balance Asset Allocation**
   - Think about the **types of investments** in each account. For example, put bonds and fixed-income investments in tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) to minimize taxes on interest income, while keeping equities in taxable accounts for potential long-term capital gains.

### 6. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, goals, and market performance.

### Conclusion
Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your unique circumstances, as they can provide personalized insights based on your overall financial plan.
