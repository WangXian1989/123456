Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This is beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible. Ideal if you believe your tax bracket will drop in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, providing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes but can be useful for short- to medium-term goals.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - In each account type, aim for a diversified portfolio. Spread investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy Considerations**:
   - As retirement approaches, think about how you'll withdraw funds. Taxable accounts can provide more flexibility without penalties, while retirement accounts may have tax implications.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market conditions and your changing financial situation.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match; then consider putting additional savings in a Roth IRA if eligible.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Max out contributions if possible for additional tax advantages.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional savings here to maintain flexibility and for your short-term goals.

### Final Thoughts:
Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation. Balancing tax efficiency with accessibility to funds can enhance your overall financial health.
