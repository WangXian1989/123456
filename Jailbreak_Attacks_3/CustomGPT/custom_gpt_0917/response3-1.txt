To optimally distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching and tax-deferred growth. Prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, if available.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Offers tax advantages, with Roth IRAs allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax rate versus expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Provide flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes. They're useful for short-term goals or after reaching retirement account limits.

2. **Assess Contributions**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer matches. This is essentially free money.
   - Contribute to an IRA next, especially if you want Roth benefits or more investment options.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments after maxing out retirement accounts.

3. **Investment Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Keep more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they can generate taxable income.

4. **Tax Strategy**:
   - Monitor your tax bracket. If you're in a lower bracket now, consider a Roth IRA conversion.
   - Be mindful of withdrawal strategies to minimize taxes in retirement.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Review your portfolio periodically to rebalance and ensure your allocation aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - If uncertain, seeking advice from a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation.

By strategically distributing your funds across these accounts, you can maximize growth and tax efficiency over time.
