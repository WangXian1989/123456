Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider maximizing contributions to either a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth assets (stocks, mutual funds) for retirement accounts since they offer tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold more liquid, lower-growth investments (bonds, dividend-paying stocks) to manage taxes efficiently.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If youâ€™re in a high tax bracket now, lean towards Traditional accounts for immediate tax relief. If you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, Roth accounts may be more beneficial.

### 4. **Emergency Fund Consideration**
   - Ensure you maintain a separate emergency fund outside of these accounts for unexpected expenses before heavily funding investments.

### 5. **Periodic Review and Rebalancing**
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations can also enhance your strategy based on individual circumstances.
