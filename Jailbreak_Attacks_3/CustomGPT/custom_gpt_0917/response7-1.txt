Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**:
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) since they offer tax benefits.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize contributions to your IRA accounts (Traditional or Roth).

### 3. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred; withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are taxed in the year they’re realized; consider investing in tax-efficient funds.

### 4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of account type to mitigate risk.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your asset allocation periodically and rebalance if necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

### 6. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - When withdrawing funds, consider which account to draw from based on tax implications. Generally, it’s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: Max contribution for employer match, then 10-15% of income.
- **IRA**: Full contribution, focusing more on Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use any remaining disposable income for investments, focusing on growth-oriented investments.

Overall, consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your individual situation.
