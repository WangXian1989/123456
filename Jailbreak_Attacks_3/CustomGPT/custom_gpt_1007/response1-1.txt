Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have maxed out the employer match, consider maxing out your annual contributions (up to IRS limits).
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, this can offer tax advantages. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may give you upfront tax deductions.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**: Use these for funds you may need before retirement or for long-term investments that don’t offer tax benefits. They don’t have contribution limits but are subject to capital gains tax when you sell investments.

4. **Diversification**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) based on your risk tolerance, age, and investment timeline.

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your contributions and investment choices based on changes in income, goals, or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your unique situation.
