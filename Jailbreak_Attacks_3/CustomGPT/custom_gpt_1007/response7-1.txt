Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRAs (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify for traditional or Roth IRA contributions, consider funding these accounts after your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.
   - Prioritize contributions to a traditional IRA if you're in a higher tax bracket and expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts. They offer flexibility and access to funds without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Based on Time Horizon**
   - If youâ€™re investing for a long-term goal (like retirement), focus on a more aggressive asset allocation in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate significant taxable income, such as bonds or funds with high turnover.

### 5. **Review Regularly and Adjust**
   - Periodically assess your financial situation and adjust your contributions. Changes in income, expenses, or financial goals can affect how you allocate your money.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider professional advice to tailor a strategy specific to your unique situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced distribution of your money that aligns with your financial goals and minimizes tax liabilities.
