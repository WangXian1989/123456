Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

### 2. **Assess Contributions Based on Goals**
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts since they offer liquidity and no penalties for early withdrawal.
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Focus on retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs for tax advantages.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** You pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed annually. Use these accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. **Balancing Risk and Diversification**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified according to your risk tolerance. You can have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts, but tailor your asset allocation based on the tax implications.

### 5. **Revisit Regularly**
   - Reassess your allocations periodically, especially after major life events (like marriage, home purchase, or job changes) or changes in financial goals.

### Conclusion
In general, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts for retirement first, utilize taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility, and adjust your strategy based on changing financial circumstances. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
