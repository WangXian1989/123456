Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for flexibility and short-term savings goals. These accounts can be more tax-efficient with investments that yield qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield from taxes. Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments (like bonds) to minimize tax impacts.

### 4. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation based on changing goals, market conditions, and any tax law updates.

### General Tips
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: They can help tailor a strategy to your unique situation.
- **Stay Informed**: Keep an eye on tax law changes that may affect your investment strategy.

This balanced approach helps you leverage the tax benefits of each account type while staying aligned with your financial goals.
