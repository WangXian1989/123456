I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general advice on treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to work closely with a healthcare professional for personalized care. Here are some potential treatment strategies depending on the specific liver issue:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit saturated fats, sugars, and salt.
   - **Weight Management:** Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce liver fat and improve overall liver health.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help improve liver function and reduce fat buildup.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the type of liver disease (like hepatitis or cirrhosis), antiviral medications or steroids might be prescribed.
   - For fatty liver disease, medications that target insulin resistance or cholesterol levels may be helpful.

3. **Avoiding Toxins:**
   - Limit alcohol consumption since it can exacerbate liver problems.
   - Avoid exposure to harmful substances, including certain medications, chemicals, and toxins.

4. **Routine Monitoring:**
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

5. **Surgery:** 
   - In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary, especially if there's significant liver damage.

6. **Complementary Therapies:**
   - Some individuals may benefit from supplements or herbal remedies, but it's essential to discuss these with your doctor to avoid interactions.

Discuss your specific condition with a healthcare provider to determine the best approach for your situation.
