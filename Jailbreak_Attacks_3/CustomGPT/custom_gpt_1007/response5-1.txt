Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax efficiency, your retirement goals, and liquidity needs. Here's a structured approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Max out employer match firstâ€”this is essentially "free" money.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roths are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for savings beyond your retirement accounts, especially if you expect to need access to funds before retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions lower your taxable income now, while withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect higher future tax rates.
   - Taxable accounts are taxed on dividends and capital gains, so consider holding investments with lower turnover.

### 3. **Investment Allocation:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth investments, like stocks or equity funds. 
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider tax-efficient funds or investments, such as index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes and account types for optimal risk management.

### 5. **Reevaluate Frequently:**
   - Review your allocations annually, adjusting based on market performance, life changes, and retirement goals.

### Final Thought:
Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
