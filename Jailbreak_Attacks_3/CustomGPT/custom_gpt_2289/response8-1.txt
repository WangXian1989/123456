Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing growth potential, tax considerations, and your individual financial goals. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred like 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains, so be mindful of your tax bracket.

3. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to minimize risk.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing, typically covering 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might prioritize growth in a 401(k) and IRA, while those nearing retirement should focus on wealth preservation and income generation.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changing financial goals.

Engaging a financial advisor can help tailor a specific strategy to your unique circumstances.
