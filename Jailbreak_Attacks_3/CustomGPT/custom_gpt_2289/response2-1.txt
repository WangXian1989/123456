Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Use pre-tax contributions for tax-deferred growth or consider a Roth 401(k) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your tax situation.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA could be beneficial. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA may offer immediate tax benefits.
   - **Contribution Limits**: If you're eligible, maximize contributions to your IRA, particularly if you're nearing retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts can provide liquidity and flexibility, allowing you to access funds without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for short-term investments or savings.
- **Medium to Long-Term Goals**: Prioritize maxing out your contributions to the 401(k) and IRA. Distribute any remaining funds to taxable accounts.

### Ongoing Reviews:
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in financial goals, and market conditions.
- **Consider Professional Advice**: Consulting with a financial planner can tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation.

Always consider your individual financial circumstances, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline when making specific decisions.
