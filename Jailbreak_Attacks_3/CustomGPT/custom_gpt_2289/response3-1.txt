Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider putting money into a traditional or Roth IRA. This can provide tax advantages, particularly if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Max Out the 401(k)**: After the match, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may provide liquidity, such as real estate or stocks. This can also be a good place for holding funds you'll need before retirement.

5. **Balance**: Adjust allocations based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. Stocks may be suitable for tax-advantaged accounts due to their growth potential, while bonds might be better in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocations annually or when your financial situation changes.
