I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Dietary adjustments (e.g., low-fat, high-fiber diet)
   - Regular exercise
   - Avoiding alcohol and certain medications

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Frequent blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, liver transplant may be considered.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Herbal supplements (consult with a healthcare provider)

Always consult a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific condition.
