Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA** contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal. 
   - Consider using a **Roth IRA** for post-tax contributions, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, think about where you'll withdraw funds. Taxable accounts could be beneficial for initial withdrawals to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account separate from these investment accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk. 

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Depending on your financial situation, seeking professional advice tailored to your needs can be helpful.

Adjust your contributions based on your changing financial situation and goals.
