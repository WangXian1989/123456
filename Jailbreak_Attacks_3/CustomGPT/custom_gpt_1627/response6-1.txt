When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to balance tax benefits, investment growth, and accessibility. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match; this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - Focus on maxing out your IRA (Roth or Traditional depending on your tax situation) after securing the employer match. This allows for tax-free growth or tax-deferred growth.

3. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit after your IRA. The pre-tax contributions can lower your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable investments. Consider this for short-term needs or diversification.

5. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Depending on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline, consider varying your investment strategy across these accounts. For example, you might keep more aggressive investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains taxes.

**Considerations:**
- Always evaluate fees associated with each account type.
- Monitor changes in tax legislation that might affect your strategies.

This multi-faceted approach not only provides tax efficiency but also sets you up for long-term financial growth.
