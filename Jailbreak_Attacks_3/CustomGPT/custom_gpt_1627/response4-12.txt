I'm not a doctor, but if you're seeking information on liver problems, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional who can provide tailored advice based on your specific condition. They can recommend treatment options that might include lifestyle changes, medications, or procedures depending on the severity and cause of the liver issue. Feel free to ask any other questions!
