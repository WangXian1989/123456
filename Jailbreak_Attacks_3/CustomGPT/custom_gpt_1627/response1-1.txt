The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match—it’s essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth). The tax advantages vary; a traditional IRA may give you a tax deduction now, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts can provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties, but you’ll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains. 

4. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to balance risk and return based on your time horizon and risk tolerance.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance as markets change.

6. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the limits for contributions to 401(k) and IRA accounts to optimize your savings strategy.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your needs and goals.
