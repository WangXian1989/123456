When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRAs and Tax Benefits**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you might consider funneling additional savings into taxable accounts. This can be useful for goals that are shorter-term, like saving for a home or a major purchase.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing in any account. A rule of thumb is 3 to 6 months' worth of living expenses in a readily accessible account.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Consider the investment strategy for each account. Tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-turnover stock funds) are typically better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while tax-efficient investments (like index funds or certain ETFs) can be kept in taxable accounts.

6. **Continual Review**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust your contributions based on changes in your income, expenses, and financial goals.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your individual circumstances.
