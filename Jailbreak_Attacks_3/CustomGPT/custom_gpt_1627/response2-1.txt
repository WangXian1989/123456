The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors such as your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). If your income allows, a Roth IRA can be especially beneficial due to tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains, whereas 401(k) and IRA investments grow tax-deferred or tax-free (Roth). Therefore, place investments that might generate high current income (like bonds or REITs) in your tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure you have a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Maintain a balanced allocation based on your age and risk tolerance through regular rebalancing across all accounts.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific circumstances and goals.
