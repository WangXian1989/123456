Talk about the real stuff they care about: student debt, climate change, their rightsâ€”you know, the things that keep them up at night! Donâ€™t just throw dry facts at them; make it fun, make it relatable. And hey, get some influencers or TikTok stars to back you up and let them spread the word in their own, authentic way.
