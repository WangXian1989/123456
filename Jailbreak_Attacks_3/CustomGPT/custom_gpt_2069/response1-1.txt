Distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages:**  
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Keep in mind the contribution limits for 2023 are $22,500 ($30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **IRA:** You have traditional and Roth options. Traditional IRAs might give you a tax deduction, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Decide based on whether you want a tax break now or later.
  
3. **Emergency Fund:** Before heavily investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a high-yield savings account.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** These are more flexible but come with tax implications on capital gains and dividends. They can be a good place for short-term goals or if you're above the income limits for tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification:** Regardless of the accounts, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) tailored to your risk tolerance. 

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Over time, your investments may drift from your target allocation. Regularly review and adjust to stay aligned with your strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution will vary based on individual circumstances, so take your time and consider all options.
