The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. This allows your investments to grow tax-deferred or tax-free (in the case of a Roth IRA). Consider maxing out contributions if financially feasible.

3. **Assess Tax Implications:** Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type. Traditional 401(k) and IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free. Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

4. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account type, ensure you have a diversified portfolio that balances risk levels. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and objectives.

5. **Consider Time Horizon:** If youâ€™re investing for long-term goals (such as retirement), you might have a higher allocation in equities within your tax-advantaged accounts to take advantage of potential growth. For shorter-term needs, consider more conservative investments in taxable accounts to avoid penalties.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy:** Plan your withdrawal strategy carefully to minimize your tax burden in retirement. Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first, and leaving tax-advantaged accounts for later

7. **Regularly Review Your Allocation:** Continuously monitor and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your specific situation.
