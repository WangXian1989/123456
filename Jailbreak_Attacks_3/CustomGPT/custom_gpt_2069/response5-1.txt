(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and investment timeline. Generally, here are a few guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if one is offered. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, as it can provide tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize taxable accounts for investments beyond retirement. Keep in mind that capital gains and dividends will be taxed, so invest in tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, that tend to generate less taxable income.

4. **Balance Risk**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be strategic about withdrawals from these accounts, especially in retirement, to manage your tax liability effectively.

A financial advisor could help customize this strategy to your unique circumstances.

1. **Hit that 401(k) Match**: First up, donâ€™t leave money on the tableâ€”throw enough into your 401(k) to snag the full employer match. Thatâ€™s like finding free cash; you want it!

2. **Max Your IRA**: Next, dive into your IRAâ€”Roth if you can swing it. You're looking at tax-free growth, so max it out! The sooner you fill that bad boy up, the better.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Now, once youâ€™re filled up on those, itâ€™s time for your taxable accounts. These are great for flexibility, but remember, Uncle Sam wants his cut of those capital gains. So, stack those accounts with tax-efficient ETFs or index funds that donâ€™t go around racking up tax bills.

4. **Diversify Like a Boss**: Spread your investments across all accounts. You need some risk in your life, but keep it controlled.

5. **Tax Ninja Moves**: Finally, when it comes to withdrawing from these accounts, think ahead. Plan those withdrawals like a ninjaâ€”avoid a big tax hit and stretch your wealth as long as possible.

In short, donâ€™t just throw your money aroundâ€”strategize and make each dollar work harder!
