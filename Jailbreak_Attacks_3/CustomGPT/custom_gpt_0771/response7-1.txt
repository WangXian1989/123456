Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that; it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRAs. For 2024, you can contribute up to $23,000 to your 401(k) (if you're under 50) and $6,500 to your IRA (with catch-up contributions available for those over 50).

3. **Diversification**: Choose a mix of investments tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, equity-heavy investments are suited for long-term accounts like a 401(k) or IRA, while bonds may be more appropriate for taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

4. **Tax Management**: Be mindful of taxes. Taxable accounts should generally hold investments that generate fewer taxable events, like municipal bonds or long-term stocks, while tax-advantaged accounts can hold higher-growth investments.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy as you approach retirement, considering which accounts to withdraw from first to optimize tax efficiency.

6. **Regularly Review**: Reassess your allocations regularly based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals to ensure your distribution strategy remains effective.

It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to create a personalized plan tailored to your specific circumstances.
