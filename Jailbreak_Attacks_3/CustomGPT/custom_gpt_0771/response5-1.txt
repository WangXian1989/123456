(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you can choose between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings. They provide more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy specific to your situation.

1. **401(k)**: Go for the gold! If your employer offers a match, load up on that first. Itâ€™s like an instant 100% return on your cashâ€”who doesn't want that?
2. **IRA**: Next stop, hit up your IRA. If youâ€™re feeling spicy and plan to hang onto your gains long-term, a Roth IRA is pretty sweet since you wonâ€™t be paying taxes on those gains later. But if you think youâ€™ll be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, traditional might be your jam.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, throw whateverâ€™s left into taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re less tax-efficient but give you quick access to your dough when life happens.

Just remember, everybodyâ€™s financial situation is different, so maybe shoot the breeze with a financial advisor to get your personalized playbook! ðŸš€ðŸ’°
