I'm here to help you prepare academic papers, but for specific financial advice like distributing funds among retirement and taxable accounts, I recommend consulting a financial advisor. They can provide personalized guidance based on your unique circumstances and goals. If you need help with educational research or writing on financial literacy, feel free to ask!
