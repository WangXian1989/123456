I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver issues, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options can vary significantly based on the specific condition (like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.). Common approaches may include lifestyle modifications such as adopting a healthier diet, increasing exercise, and possibly medications to manage symptoms or underlying causes.

In some cases, more serious conditions might require advanced treatments like liver transplantation. Make sure to discuss your symptoms and history with a qualified medical provider who can give you the best guidance based on your individual situation.
