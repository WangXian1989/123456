The best method for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically involves considering several key factors, such as your investment goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowable if feasible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

2. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to your funds before retirement. Focus on assets that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs.

3. **Balance Risk and Growth**:
   - Allocate higher-risk investments in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) where gains are taxed later, while holding lower-risk investments that generate dividends in taxable accounts.

4. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation based on shifts in market conditions, changes in personal circumstances, or nearing retirement age.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and ensure optimal asset allocation.
