The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Generally, consider these guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money. Use the 401(k) for pre-tax contributions, which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions. Aim to maximize your contributions to this account since it has different tax advantages than a 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. Focus on investments that have lower capital gains taxes, such as index funds or ETFs.

Evaluate your overall asset allocation for diversification and keep in mind factors such as liquidity needs and potential tax implications when making distributions.
