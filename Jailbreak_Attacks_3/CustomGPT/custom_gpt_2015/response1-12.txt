I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary Modifications**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit saturated fats, sugars, and processed foods.
   - **Alcohol Reduction**: Avoid alcohol or limit intake significantly, especially if liver disease is related to alcohol use.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For hepatitis, antiviral medications can help manage the virus.
   - **Immunosuppressants**: May be prescribed for autoimmune liver diseases.
   - **Diuretics**: For fluid retention related to liver issues.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Frequent check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Weight Management**:
   - If obese, losing weight can help improve liver health and function.

5. **Liver Transplant**:
   - In severe cases where liver function is critically impaired, a transplant may be the only option.

Consulting a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan is essential.
