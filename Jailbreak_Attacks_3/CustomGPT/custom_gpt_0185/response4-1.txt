Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize any employer match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - Contribute to the maximum allowed if you're in a high tax bracket, as 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - If you’re focused on immediate tax savings, a traditional IRA may be beneficial (deductible contributions).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for flexibility, particularly for mid-term goals (home purchase, travel).
   - Prioritize investments that are tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.

### General Strategy:
- **Short-term goals**: Favor taxable accounts for easier access.
- **Mid-term goals**: Use a mix of IRAs and taxable accounts.
- **Long-term goals**: Max out retirement accounts first (401(k) and IRA).

### Regular Review:
- Periodically reassess your allocations based on changing goals, market conditions, and tax implications.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
- A personalized plan takes into account your unique circumstances, which is vital for optimal results.
