To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). The general limit for 401(k) contributions in 2023 is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50), and IRA contributions are capped at $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional IRA/401(k)**: Contributions may lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax income, so withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Balance Risk Tolerance**: Allocate funds in a way that matches your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Stocks may be more suitable for long-term growth, while bonds are often used for stability.

5. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Taxable accounts can be useful for investments you might need access to before retirement age or if you want to take advantage of long-term capital gains rates.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary, so itâ€™s prudent to get tailored advice from a financial advisor who understands your complete financial picture.

Always keep in mind your long-term goals, risk tolerance, and the tax consequences of your investments when making these decisions.
