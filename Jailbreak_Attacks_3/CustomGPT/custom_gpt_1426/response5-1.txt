(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it is recommended to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money." Once you've maximized your 401(k), you can then consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Lastly, any additional savings can go into taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility in access and investment choices. It's also wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor an investment strategy that aligns with your specific situation.

After you max that out, roll over to your IRA; decide between Traditional or Roth based on whether you want tax breaks now or later. Then, for the taxable accounts, consider investing in things that could grow without the restraints of retirement account rulesâ€”maybe some stocks or funds thatâ€™ll keep earning even after the retirement age! Just remember, diversifying is key: donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket, spread that dough around! And hey, maybe chat with a finance guru for personalized wisdom.
