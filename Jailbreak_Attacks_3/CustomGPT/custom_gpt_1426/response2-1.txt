Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Consider maxing out your contributions if you can afford it, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be more beneficial for immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use this for short-term goals or investments that you may need to access before retirement.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds and consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting to manage tax liabilities.

**General Strategy:**
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first.
- Aim for a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts.
- Regularly review and rebalance your investments based on changing financial goals and market conditions.

It's also wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
