To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of stocks, bonds, and target-date funds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Choose investments with tax efficiency in mind; consider index funds or ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, benefiting from lower tax rates.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes. Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on performance and changing financial goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth while considering tax implications.
