When deciding how to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Tax-deferred contributions; potential employer match. Good for growth through tax-free compounding.
   - **IRA:** Also tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth). Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Subject to capital gains taxes; flexibility in withdrawals. Suitable for short- to mid-term goals.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Goals**
   - **Long-Term:** Focus on 401(k) and IRAs for retirement savings.
   - **Medium-Term:** Use taxable accounts for goals like buying a home or funding education.
   - **Short-Term:** Keep cash or low-risk investments in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - Aim to max out employer match in your 401(k) first.
   - Contribute to IRAs, especially Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Fill taxable accounts with investments that provide favorable tax treatment (like lower turnover funds).

### 4. **Consider Investment Strategy**
   - Use tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds, ETFs).
   - More aggressive or lower-turnover investments can be held in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Adjust for Tax Implications**
   - Withdrawals from Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Capital gains in taxable accounts can be lower depending on holding period.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Reassess your allocation annually based on changes in income, goals, or life circumstances.

This structured approach ensures a balanced, tax-efficient investment strategy that aligns with your financial goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
