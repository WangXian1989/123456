Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing to the maximum allowed if your employer matches. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA next. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These are great for goals that are shorter-term since you can access funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and timeline.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically check and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your financial goals and market changes.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
