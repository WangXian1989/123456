When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax advantages as a 401(k), but income limits may apply for tax-deductible contributions if you also have a workplace retirement plan.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider a Roth if you expect your tax rate to increase in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here do not have tax advantages but allow for more flexibility in withdrawals and investments.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings for short-term needs before maximizing retirement account contributions.

4. **Investment Diversification**: Each account can hold different types of investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds). Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals when selecting assets for each account type.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, strategize about how you'll withdraw funds from each account. This can impact your tax liability.

6. **Investment Horizon**: If you are younger, you might take on more risk in your 401(k) and IRA, while keeping safer investments in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and changing market conditions.

It's always a good idea to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
