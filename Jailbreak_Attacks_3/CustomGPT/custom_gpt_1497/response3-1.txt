Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering a few key factors, such as your investment goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to traditional accounts lower your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - Taxable accounts can provide flexibility in withdrawals and may have favorable capital gains treatment.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts due to tax implications on growth.

4. **Keep an Eye on Fees**:
   - Compare investment options in your 401(k) for fees. Sometimes IRAs offer lower-cost investment options.

5. **Adjust for Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**:
   - If you're nearing retirement, consider how RMDs from your 401(k) and IRAs will affect your tax situation. You may want to shift more savings to taxables as you age.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

As a rule of thumb, a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
