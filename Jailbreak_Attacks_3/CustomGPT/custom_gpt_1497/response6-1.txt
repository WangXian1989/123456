To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax Benefits**:
   - **Contribute to 401(k) First**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the maximum match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (for tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (for tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate favorable capital gains or qualified dividends, as they are taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on higher-growth investments (like stocks) here since withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - **Long-Term Focus**: Funds in 401(k) and IRA accounts are generally for long-term retirement savings, allowing for more growth-oriented investments (e.g., stocks).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Depending on your time horizon, you might want to hold more liquid or less aggressive investments if you expect to access these funds sooner.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly assess and adjust your asset allocation based on changing goals, market conditions, and life circumstances.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts and aligning investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon, you can optimize your savings strategy.
