The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money. Consider contributing up to the annual limit if you can.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Impact**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate less tax or can benefit from long-term capital gains rates. This can be ideal for bonds or investments you might want to access before retirement age without penalties.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments within each account type. For instance, you might want more stocks in your Roth IRA due to its tax-free growth potential, while keeping more stable investments in your taxable accounts.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your overall asset allocation annually and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity for emergencies before pouring large amounts into retirement accounts.

### 6. **Consult a Professional**
   - Given the complexity of tax laws and investment strategies, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

By carefully balancing contributions and considering tax implications, you can optimize your investment strategy across these accounts.
