Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **Max out employer match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential immediate tax benefits.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth; you'll pay taxes on withdrawals.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRA contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free; traditional IRAs provide upfront tax deductions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Use this account for investments you might need to access before retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your investment allocations periodically and adjust based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

This strategy can help optimize tax advantages while aligning with your financial goals.
