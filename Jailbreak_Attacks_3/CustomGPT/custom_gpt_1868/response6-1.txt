Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible. These accounts grow tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on earnings until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) here.

### 2. **Retirement Goals:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Consider maxing out your IRA if you’re eligible, especially if your income allows for a Roth IRA.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure you have a well-diversified investment strategy across all accounts, considering factors like risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs:**
   - Keep an eye on your liquidity needs; take into account how much you might need for emergencies or short-term goals.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your income, maxing out if possible
- **IRA:** Up to $6,500 annually ($7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remainder, focusing on tax-efficient investments

### Final Thoughts:
- Regularly review your distribution, adjusting for changes in income, goals, or tax laws.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique situation.
