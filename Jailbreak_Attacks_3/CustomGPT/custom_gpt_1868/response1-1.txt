Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If not already maxed out, consider maxing out contributions to take advantage of tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: Once your 401(k) is maxed, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings and investments once you’ve maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. They can provide flexibility for shorter-term goals.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Long-Term Focus**: Invest in a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance. Consider keeping more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates.

5. **Regular Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and your personal financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.
