The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for 401(k) accounts, which can change annually. Max out if you can, especially if youâ€™re in your peak earning years.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as contributions are made with after-tax dollars. A Traditional IRA may be better if you want tax deductions now.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Similar to 401(k)s, IRAs have annual contribution limits. Make sure to stay within these limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Money in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, making them good for short-term goals or emergency funds.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments longer to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts**: Start with your 401(k) and IRAs to maximize tax benefits.
- **Allocate based on risk tolerance**: Distribute funds among the accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Consider tax implications**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (e.g., index funds).
