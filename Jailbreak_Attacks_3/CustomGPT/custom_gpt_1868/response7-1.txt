Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires considering several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here’s a breakdown of how to approach this:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating money elsewhere. This is essentially free money.
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After securing the match, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA (traditional or Roth) if you're eligible, as these accounts offer tax benefits either now or in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth). Traditional 401(k)s lower your taxable income now, while Roth 401(k)s provide tax-free growth.
   - **IRA:** Similar to 401(k)s, traditional IRAs allow for pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes and dividends tax, so consider placing investments with lower expected turnover and capital gains in these accounts.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon, adjust your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) across accounts. You might want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - **Diversification:** Ensure that you’re diversified not just within each account but across all accounts.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawals and Future Needs:**
   - If you expect to need money before retirement, prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity. Keep in mind that taking funds from tax-advantaged accounts may incur penalties if done prematurely.

### 5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and retirement goals. Adjust contributions and investments as needed to stay on track with your financial objectives.

### Example Approach:
1. **Maximize 401(k)** (up to match).
2. **Contribute to IRA** (max out if possible).
3. **Invest in Taxable Account** with surplus funds.

### Conclusion:
The best distribution varies based on individual circumstances, but maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first while being mindful of tax implications and liquidity needs is generally a good strategy. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
