Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, this may be advantageous.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax on investments sold at a profit. They can offer more flexibility for withdrawals but are generally less tax-advantageous than retirement accounts.

3. **Prioritize Roth Accounts**: If eligible, consider prioritizing contributions to a Roth IRA after maxing out the 401(k) match, especially if you anticipate higher taxes later.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, and other securities) in each account to reduce risk and enhance returns. 

5. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, maintain an easily accessible emergency fund in your taxable accounts.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw from these accounts during retirement. Generally, it may be tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts last.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a professional can help craft a strategy that considers your unique circumstances.

By effectively managing contributions and understanding the tax implications, you can optimize your overall investment strategy for retirement.
