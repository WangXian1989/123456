Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: Take advantage of high contribution limits.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.
   - **Diversification**: IRAs can allow for a wider range of investment options compared to a 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider low-turnover index funds or ETFs to minimize taxable gains.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. Max out your 401(k) contributions (especially to get the employer match).
2. Contribute to an IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth.
3. Invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and liquidity, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Factors to Consider:
- **Age and Retirement Timeline**: Younger investors may prefer more aggressive growth in tax-sheltered accounts, while those closer to retirement may focus on preserving capital.
- **Current Tax Bracket**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from different accounts.
- **Financial Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your life goals—retirement, buying a home, etc.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation.
