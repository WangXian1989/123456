Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match. This is effectively free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the maximum limit if you're not receiving a match. This reduces your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute to an IRA, considering the tax implications (traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for money you'll need sooner, as these offer flexibility in withdrawals. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider stocks, bonds, and other assets suitable for your long-term goals.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a separate, easily accessible account.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best allocation strategy for your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

By following this strategy, you can effectively manage your savings and investments across your different accounts while optimizing for tax efficiency and growth potential.
