(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA since they offer tax benefits. 

1. **Contribute to your 401(k) first**, especially if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Next, allocate funds to your IRA** (Roth or Traditional) to take advantage of additional tax benefits.
3. **Finally, consider taxable accounts** for any additional savings or investment plans beyond the limits of your retirement accounts, keeping in mind the tax implications of capital gains.

It's also wise to regularly review and adjust your allocation based on your retirement timeline and market conditions.

1. **Go hard on that 401(k)** first! Max out whatever your employer matches â€” thatâ€™s free cash! Itâ€™s like finding cash in your coat pocket but way cooler.
2. **Hit up your IRA** next. This bad boy is a tax-advantaged paradise. Roth if you want tax-free withdrawals later or Traditional if you like the idea of a tax break now! 
3. Finally, sprinkle some savings into your **taxable account** for flexibility; just remember, itâ€™s like the wild west â€” capital gains tax can hit you when you least expect it!

So, keep that cash flowing smartly, and donâ€™t forget to adjust your strategy as you go. Itâ€™s all about playing the long game while keeping your eyes peeled for opportunities! ðŸ’¸
