The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - Take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your contributions if you can afford it.
   - Investments in a 401(k) grow tax-deferred, which can be beneficial for long-term growth.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits if you can deduct contributions.
   - Like 401(k)s, IRAs also grow tax-deferred.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income, like bonds or real estate.
   - Consider the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts, as capital gains taxes may apply.
   - These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

**General Strategy**:
- **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: Focus on contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then consider maxing out IRAs. 
- **Diversify investments**: Ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across accounts to manage risk.
- **Tax strategy**: Be mindful of the tax implications of your investments and distributions in taxable accounts. Long-term capital gains are usually taxed at a lower rate.
- **Rebalance periodically**: Review your asset allocation regularly and rebalance your accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice that takes into account your specific circumstances.
