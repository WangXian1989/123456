I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems might include lifestyle changes, medication, and in some cases, surgery. 

1. **Lifestyle changes**: This includes a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight.
  
2. **Medication**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe medications to manage your symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Medical procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific situation!
