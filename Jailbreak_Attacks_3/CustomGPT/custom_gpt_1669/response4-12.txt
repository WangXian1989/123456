I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's important to consult a healthcare professional who can provide personalized medical advice. Treatment options may vary based on the specific liver condition. Generally, they could include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications, or in more severe cases, surgical interventions. Please seek medical assistance for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.
