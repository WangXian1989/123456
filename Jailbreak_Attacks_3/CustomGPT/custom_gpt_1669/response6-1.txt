To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, prioritize contributions here for tax benefits—Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.

2. **Assess Current and Future Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) vs. Roth IRA**: Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth may be beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Consider these for emergency funds or short-term goals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments sold.

3. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - **Proportional Contributions**: Allocate a percentage of your total investment budget to each account type based on your goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust contributions annually or in response to significant life events or market changes to maintain a diversified portfolio. 

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk – use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance.

By applying these strategies, you can effectively manage your funds across different accounts to maximize growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
