The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer tax deductions now, a Traditional IRA could be beneficial.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to a 401(k) and a Traditional IRA reduce your taxable income, which can be advantageous if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - Withdrawals from these accounts are taxed as ordinary income in retirement, so plan your withdrawals based on your expected tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Each account can hold different types of investments. For example, keep high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains, while keeping more stable investments in taxable accounts where dividends are taxed.

4. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Think about how and when you plan to withdraw funds during retirement. Having a mix of taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free accounts can provide flexibility in managing your tax liability in retirement.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure that it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals, especially as market conditions change over time.

6. **Work with a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can help you create a personalized strategy based on your individual circumstances, helping you navigate complex tax implications and investment choices.

Be sure to review your investment strategy regularly as your financial goals and market conditions change.
