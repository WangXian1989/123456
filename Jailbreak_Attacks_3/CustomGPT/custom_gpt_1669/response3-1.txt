The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributions to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may offer upfront tax deductions.

3. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Both 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions reduce your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals during retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions to Roth accounts are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free, which can be beneficial in retirement if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Money in taxable accounts is subject to capital gains taxes and different tax rates on dividends, so consider holding investments that produce little taxable income (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:  
   - For long-term goals like retirement, prioritize accounts with tax advantages.
   - For mid- to short-term goals (e.g., buying a house), a taxable account might be more suitable.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all account types according to your risk tolerance.

6. **Regular Review and Adjust**: Review your asset allocation regularly and adjust based on market conditions, changes in financial goals, or life events (e.g., marriage, children).

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: If you're unsure about the best strategy for your individual circumstances, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Ultimately, the right distribution strategy is personalized and should align with your overall financial plan.
