Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax implications, investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. Understand the Account Types:
- **401(k):** Typically offers higher contribution limits and employer match options. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** IRAs offer tax advantages depending on the type. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but provide liquidity and flexibility. You pay capital gains tax on profits when you sell investments.

### 2. Consider Tax Efficiency:
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) & IRA):** Prioritize maxing out contributions here first for tax benefits.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that may generate capital gains or income, such as stocks or ETFs, which can be more tax-efficient.

### 3. Distribute Based on Goals:
- **Long-Term Growth:** Use 401(k) and Roth IRAs for aggressive growth investments (stocks, mutual funds) due to their tax advantages.
- **Income Needs or Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for more liquid assets or income-generating investments to maintain flexibility.

### 4. Risk Tolerance:
- **Higher Risk:** Allocate more to stocks in retirement accounts where the tax benefits are maximized.
- **Lower Risk:** Consider bond allocations in taxable accounts to manage taxes on interest income effectively.

### 5. Contribution Strategy:
- Aim for employer match in 401(k) first.
- Contribute to an IRA if eligible.
- Allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 50% of total savings (maximize employer match)
- **IRA:** 30% of total savings (split between Traditional and Roth if eligible)
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20% of total savings

### 6. Monitor and Adjust:
- Reassess allocations regularly based on market conditions, changes in income, and life events.

This balanced approach helps you leverage tax advantages while ensuring enough liquidity for short-term needs. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
