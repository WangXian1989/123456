Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Max Out Your IRA Contributions**:
   - If you qualify, consider maximizing your contributions to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can be particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Balance Between Accounts**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: These accounts grow tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on gains until you withdraw. Contributing here can lower your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but future withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free. This can be great for tax diversification in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you'll need access to before retirement, or for goals such as buying a house. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

4. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**:
   - Allocate growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - Place bonds or conservative assets in taxable accounts, where interest income may be taxed at a higher rate.

5. **Regular Review and Adjustments**:
   - Reassess your allocation periodically based on market performance, changes in income, and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized strategies, especially regarding tax implications.

This high-level approach should give you a starting point. Tailoring your strategy to your specific circumstances is crucial for effective money management.
