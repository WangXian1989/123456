To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Lower Tax Burden with IRA Contributions:**
   - If you qualify, contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals during retirement.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. For instance, younger investors might favor stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement may prefer conservative investments like bonds or cash equivalents.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Consider the tax implications of each account type:
     - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Tax-deferred, taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA:** No taxes on qualified withdrawals.
     - **Taxable Accounts:** Capital gains taxes apply, so consider placing investments with high turnover or interest (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals:**
   - Keep enough liquidity in taxable accounts for immediate needs or emergencies, as retirement accounts often have withdrawal penalties.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically assess your investment allocations to ensure they still align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor to craft a strategy aligned with your specific circumstances.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to max out the employer match.
- **Traditional IRA:** Max out contributions if eligible and tax-deductible.
- **Roth IRA:** If income limits allow, consider a backdoor Roth.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional funds, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

Tailor this general framework to your unique situation, considering factors like income level, retirement timeline, and individual risk tolerance.
