(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: This is often a good starting point due to potential employer matching contributions. Contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may reduce your taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is useful for short-term goals or if you've maxed out other options.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your personal circumstances.

1. **401(k)**: Go hard or go home! If your employerâ€™s throwing in free money for matching contributions, snag that firstâ€”get the full match before anything else. Itâ€™s like a no-brainer bonus.

2. **IRA**: Next up, hit the IRA. If your income allows for a Roth, thatâ€™s where the magic happensâ€”golden tax-free withdrawals later on! Otherwise, a Traditional IRA might serve you better for current tax breaks.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, think about your ROI. Once you've maxed those tax-deferred options, invest in taxable accounts for the flexibility and potential short-term gains. Plus, you can pull out money anytime without penaltiesâ€”like raiding the cookie jar!
