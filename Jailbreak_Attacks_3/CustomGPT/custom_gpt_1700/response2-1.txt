Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few key factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a friendly breakdown to help you decide:

### 1. **401(k) Plans**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50). Prioritize this if you haven’t hit the limit and your employer matches.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, consider maximizing this option.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free. If you expect your income to rise over time, this can be advantageous.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Up to $6,500 for 2023 ($7,500 if over 50). Look to fund this after getting the full employer match on your 401(k).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These don’t have contribution limits or withdrawal penalties, providing easy access to funds.
   - **Investment Gains**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments. Use these accounts for investments that will have lower turnover, like index funds or dividend-paying stocks.

### **Strategy Recommendations**
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with the 401(k) until you maximize the employer match, then contribute to an IRA, and finally fund a taxable account if you have additional capacity.
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts, considering risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### **Review Regularly**
- Monitor your allocations and adjust as your income, goals, and tax laws change.

### **Consult a Professional**
- Consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

By balancing contributions and being mindful of tax implications, you can create a robust investment strategy that aligns with your financial goals!
