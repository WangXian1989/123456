To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you're eligible, or a traditional IRA for potential immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments, allowing easier access without penalties.
   - **Long-Term Savings**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for retirement, benefitting from tax deferrals and growth.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for investments that may generate capital gains, where you can offset taxes with losses.
   - **Retirement Accounts**: Contributions and growth are tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth), which is beneficial for long-term investing.

### 4. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**
   - Maintain a mix of stocks and bonds tailored to your risk tolerance within each account, ensuring a balance that aligns with your overall strategy.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically revisit your allocations to align with changing financial situations, market conditions, and tax laws.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for tax efficiency and align with your financial goals.
