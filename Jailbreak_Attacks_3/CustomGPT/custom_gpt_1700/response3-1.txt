When figuring out how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high enough income, prioritize maxing out your contributions. The 2024 limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. The contribution limit for 2024 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). If eligible, a Roth IRA can be advantageous for tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate extra funds to taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility for withdrawals and investments not limited by retirement account rules.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally, choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRAs**: You may have more investment options, allowing for a tailored approach depending on your retirement goals.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Consider investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, which may result in lower capital gains taxes.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your contributions and investment strategy based on changes in income, market conditions, or life events.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

This balanced approach will help optimize your long-term growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
