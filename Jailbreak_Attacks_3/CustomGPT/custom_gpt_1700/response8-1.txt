When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match; this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high contribution limits and potential for employer matching, this should be a priority.
   - **IRA**: If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, consider prioritizing contributions here for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Keep some funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs or if you anticipate needing access to your money before retirement.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or mutual funds with high turnover) in tax-advantaged accounts, while utilizing taxable accounts for long-term growth investments (like ETFs or stocks).

5. **Rebalance Annually**: Review and adjust your allocations yearly based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: If you’re unsure, consulting a financial planner can provide personalized guidance based on your situation.

This approach helps you balance growth, tax efficiency, and liquidity over your investment timeline.
