Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a breakdown of strategies for each:

### 1. **401(k) Account**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth 401(k) may be beneficial, otherwise, a traditional 401(k) can lower your taxable income now.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Contribute the Max**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50). 
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Similar to a 401(k), consider your future tax rate. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use this account for funds you may need before retirement. 
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Tips
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a robust emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Diversification**: Diversify within each account type to mitigate risks.
- **Allocation Strategy**: Generally, place more high-growth, high-risk investments in tax-deferred accounts and more stable assets in taxable accounts.

### Conclusion
Every financial situation is unique. Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor the strategy to your specific needs. Consider your retirement timeline, income levels, and risk tolerance when making these decisions.
