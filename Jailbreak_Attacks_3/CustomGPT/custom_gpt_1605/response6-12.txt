1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: 
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - **Routine Blood Tests**: To monitor liver function.
   - **Imaging Tests**: Ultrasounds or CT scans to assess liver health.

4. **Avoid Alcohol**: Completely abstain from alcohol to prevent further damage.
