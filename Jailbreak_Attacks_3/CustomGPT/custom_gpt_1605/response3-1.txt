Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize tax benefits and growth potential. Here are some strategies:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first, as it’s essentially free money.

### 2. Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: After maxing out the 401(k) employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions on contributions.

### 3. Taxable Accounts
- Use taxable accounts for money you might need access to before retirement. These accounts can provide flexibility, but you’ll pay taxes on any dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 4. Consider Your Tax Bracket
- **Higher Income Bracket**: Focus more on tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) to lower current taxable income.
- **Lower Income Bracket**: Roth accounts can be beneficial, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 5. Diversification of Investments
- Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk and optimize growth.

### 6. Rebalance Regularly
- Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation as needed to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: Maximize up to employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the annual limit.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional funds.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach across these accounts, focusing on maximizing benefits, aligns well with both short- and long-term financial goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies.
