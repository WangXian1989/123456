I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common treatment options depending on the specific liver condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and limit saturated fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine blood tests and imaging may be necessary to monitor liver function and the progression of the disease.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or even liver transplantation may be required.

5. **Supplements**: 
   - Some may benefit from supplements such as vitamin E or anti-inflammatory agents, but consult a doctor first.

Always talk to your healthcare provider to determine the best approach for your specific situation.
