Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out contributions (up to $22,500 for 2024, plus catch-up contributions if eligible).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA (maximum $6,500 for 2024).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional savings or investments. This can provide flexibility for withdrawals before retirement age.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Adjust contributions based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement plans. 

Consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
