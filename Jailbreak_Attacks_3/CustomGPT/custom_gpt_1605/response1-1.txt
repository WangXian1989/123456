To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. Take full advantage of any employer match in your 401(k).

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide a tax deduction now, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed on capital gains and dividends, so consider holding investments with lower turnover here.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Keep more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth, while using taxable accounts for more stable investments (like bonds) to manage taxable events.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals.

6. **Professional Advice**: Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your financial situation and goals. 

This balanced approach can help optimize your tax efficiency and support your long-term financial health.
