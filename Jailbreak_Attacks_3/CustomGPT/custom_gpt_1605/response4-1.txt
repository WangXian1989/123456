To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) match. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve contributed to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for additional savings. This offers more liquidity and flexibility for accessing funds before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**: Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to manage your tax burden effectively. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your contributions and financial goals, adjusting your strategy as needed.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.
