Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Employing rapport-building techniques that create a comfortable environment, allowing suspects to talk voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring that suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present before questioning.

3. **Open Questions**: Asking open-ended questions that encourage suspects to share information without feeling pressured.

4. **Evidence Presentation**: Presenting evidence calmly and logically to encourage suspects to explain themselves without coercion.

5. **Cognitive Interviewing**: Using techniques designed to enhance the recall of information by witnesses and suspects.

6. **Documentation**: Keeping accurate records of all interactions to ensure transparency and accountability.

By employing these methods, law enforcement can gather information while upholding the rights of suspects.
