I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about treatment options for liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

Common treatment options for liver issues include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Avoiding alcohol
   - Maintaining a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to address symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring and Follow-Up**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor your liver health.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be necessary.

5. **Supplements and Herbal Remedies**: Some people explore options like milk thistle, but it's crucial to discuss these with your doctor first.

Always follow your healthcare providerâ€™s recommendations for the best outcome.
