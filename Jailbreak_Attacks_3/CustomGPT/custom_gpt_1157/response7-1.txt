Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors, including your current financial situation, tax implications, retirement goals, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions:** 
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. For 2023, the maximum employee contribution is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you meet income eligibility, or a traditional IRA for its tax-deductible contributions. The annual limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are subject to taxes, but you can also use tax-loss harvesting strategies.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Allocate across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) in each account type based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. 
   - For example, you might want to hold higher-risk investments (like stocks) in your Roth IRA for long-term growth.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your allocations periodically and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies for Retirement:**
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw money in retirement. Typically, it’s advisable to draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (like the Roth IRA) to minimize tax burdens.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 50% of annual contributions up to the match limit.
- **IRA:** 30% of total contributions to either a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20% for any additional savings or investments after reaching limits on the other accounts.
