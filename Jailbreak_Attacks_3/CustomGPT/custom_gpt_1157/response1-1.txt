Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors, such as your financial goals, investment horizon, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, and investment gains grow tax-deferred until withdrawal. Ideal for high-income earners looking to reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions similar to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals (if certain conditions are met). Consider your current vs. future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes, making them less tax-efficient for holding assets that generate ordinary income.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match**: Max out your contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA Limits**: Consider maximizing your IRA contributions next. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings and investments once you've maxed out tax-advantaged options.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Typically a mix of stock and bond funds. Choose diversified funds with low fees.
   - **IRA**: Similar to your 401(k), but you have a broader selection of investments (including individual stocks and funds).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on long-term investments to minimize capital gains taxes, and consider tax-efficient funds or ETFs.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for tax implications when withdrawing; pulling from tax-advantaged accounts first may minimize tax liability.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Regularly reassess your allocations based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial situation.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k)**: 30% (max out contributions)
- **Traditional IRA**: 25% (balance with Roth for tax diversification)
- **Roth IRA**: 15% 
- **Taxable Account**: 30% (for liquidity and flexibility)

### Final Thoughts
Adjust proportions based on personal risk tolerance and financial needs. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored guidance based on your specific situation.
