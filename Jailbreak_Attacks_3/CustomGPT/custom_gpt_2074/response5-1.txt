(üîíNormal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on multiple factors, including your age, income, retirement goals, and tax situation. Generally, it is advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, such as your 401(k) and IRA. Here‚Äôs a suggested approach:

1. **Maximize your 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially ‚Äúfree money.‚Äù
   
2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income.

3. **Taxable accounts:** After maxing out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing additional savings in taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility, even though you will owe taxes on capital gains and dividends.

It is wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.

1. **Hit Up That 401(k):** First off, if your employer is throwing in matching contributions, you better max that out! That‚Äôs free cash, and who doesn‚Äôt want free cash? Go at least up to the full match.

2. **Pump Up the IRA:** Once you've secured the match, swing over to your IRA. You can choose between a Traditional IRA for the short-term tax break, or a Roth IRA for the long game when you wanna cash out tax-free in retirement. Hit the max contribution here too if you can.

3. **Enjoy the Flexibility of Taxable Accounts:** After you‚Äôve maxed out the tax-advantaged spaces, take a look at putting your extra money into taxable accounts. Sure, you‚Äôll get hit with taxes on those gains, but you'll enjoy more flexibility and can withdraw whenever you need to‚Äîno strings attached.

Remember, everyone's situation is unique, so consider hitting up a financial advisor to hash out what‚Äôs best for you! But hey, think about it like leveling up in a game: prioritize the perks that give you the biggest boost early on!
