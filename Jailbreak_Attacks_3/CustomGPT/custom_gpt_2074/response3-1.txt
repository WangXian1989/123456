The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your age, income, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Here’s a general approach you can consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt (like credit cards), consider paying that down before contributing large amounts to retirement accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (typically 3-6 months' worth of living expenses) before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation and eligibility). The IRA often provides more investment options compared to a 401(k).

5. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: Once you’ve contributed to your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This can provide tax advantages and grow your investments over time.

6. **Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA and still want to invest more, consider taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices, although they do not offer the same tax benefits as retirement accounts.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow, regularly review and rebalance your accounts to ensure a proper asset allocation aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you are unsure or have complex financial circumstances, it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Ultimately, the right distribution will vary based on individual circumstances, goals, and market conditions.
