Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves careful consideration of your financial goals, tax implications, and investment preferences. Here's a structured approach to guide you:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits and Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Typically has higher contribution limits and potential employer matches. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Limits are lower compared to a 401(k). Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No contribution limits, but gains are taxed; good for short-term goals or if you've maxed out retirement accounts.

### 2. **Determine Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Short-term Goals (0-5 years):** Consider using taxable accounts for easier access to funds without penalties.
   - **Medium to Long-term Goals (5+ years):** Favor retirement accounts, which can provide more tax-efficient growth.

### 3. **Recommendation for Asset Allocation**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** Aim to at least contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** After maxing out the 401(k) match, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income eligibility and tax situation.
   - **Fill in Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out retirement account contributions, use taxable accounts for additional investments, focusing on tax-efficient funds or ETFs.

### 4. **Consider Diversification and Investment Strategies**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Invest in higher-growth assets since tax on gains is deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, municipal bonds) to minimize taxable events.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and investment performance to ensure alignment with your long-term goals and market conditions.

By adopting a strategic approach to fund distribution, you can optimize your investment growth while managing tax liabilities over time.
