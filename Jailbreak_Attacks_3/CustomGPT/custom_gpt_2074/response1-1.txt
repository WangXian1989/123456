Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first â€“ that's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out your contributions if possible, especially if there's an employer match. Consider a traditional 401(k) for tax-deferred growth or a Roth 401(k) if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it valuable if you expect high income later.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, look into how to invest in taxable accounts. These might hold investments that generate little income or capital gains, which can help keep your tax liability lower.

4. **Asset Location**: Be mindful of what assets you hold in which accounts. Generally, place higher-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts and lower-growth, high dividend yield investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax drag.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing. This will provide a safety net without needing to withdraw from your retirement accounts prematurely.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as your financial situation, market conditions, and investment objectives change.

Consulting with a financial advisor may also provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances. Remember, a well-thought-out strategy can help optimize your retirement savings and impact your long-term financial health significantly.
