Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: After handling your IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the IRS limit. This is a good way to save for retirement while reducing your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds to invest after contributing to retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications for withdrawals from each account type, especially as you approach retirement.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
