To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approaches:

### 1. **Tax-Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) and IRA, as these offer tax deferral or tax-free growth opportunities.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may provide more liquidity or for funds needed in the short term.

### 2. **Investment Allocation**
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers limited investment choices but can be beneficial for employer matching. Focus on a diverse mix of index funds or low-cost ETFs.
   - **IRA**: This is where you can take advantage of a wider range of investment options. Consider a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold more tax-efficient investments here, like ETFs or municipal bonds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Contribution Prioritization**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable each year, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts as needed.

### 4. **Rebalancing Regularly**
   - **Monitor Your Portfolio**: Adjust allocations annually or semi-annually to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

### Summary
Distributing your money effectively involves balancing tax efficiency, investment diversity, and your immediate financial needs. Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts while ensuring you have liquidity for future needs. Regular monitoring and understanding of each account type can help you make informed decisions.
