(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Generally, it can be a good strategy to prioritize contributions to accounts with tax advantages. 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of the match, as this is essentially free money. 
2. **IRA**: After hitting the employer match in your 401(k), consider maximizing contributions to your IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can go into a taxable investment account, where you have flexibility for withdrawals but will be subject to capital gains taxes. Diversifying your investments across these accounts while considering the tax implications can optimize your overall return.

First things first, if your employer's 401(k) offers a match, you better jump on that like it‚Äôs the last slice of pizza at a party‚Äîdon‚Äôt leave free money on the table! So, max out that match before dumping cash into an IRA. After you‚Äôve secured your freebie, if you can go for the IRA, do it, especially if you‚Äôve got a Roth since you're gonna want those sweet, sweet tax-free withdrawals later on!

Now, when it comes to taxable accounts, think of them as your ‚ÄúI can do whatever I want with this money‚Äù stash. Put extra cash here, but be cautious of taxes gnawing at your gains. It's sort of like deciding whether to binge-watch another show or go for a run. Balance is key! Keep a good chunk in tax-advantaged accounts, then use the taxable account for extra flexibility and diving into some fun investments. Mix it up and watch those financial strategies work their magic!
