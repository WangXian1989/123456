To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s. These accounts often provide tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth**: If you have the option, decide between a Traditional IRA/401(k) and a Roth IRA/401(k). Contributions to Traditional accounts may lower your taxable income now, while contributions to Roth accounts grow tax-free and can be withdrawn tax-free in retirement.

4. **Balance Contributions**: After your tax-advantaged accounts, you can start contributing to a taxable account. This allows for more flexibility, as you can withdraw funds at any time without penalties, although you will pay taxes on earnings.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each type of account, consider diversifying your investments (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to spread risk and optimize returns.

6. **Adjust as You Age**: Ensure your asset allocation reflects your age and risk tolerance. Generally, younger investors can afford to take more risks, while older investors may want to be more conservative.

7. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review your portfolio and reallocate funds as necessary, taking into account changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement timeline.

8. **Consult a Professional**: If you're unsure, consider seeking advice from a financial planner who can provide personalized recommendations based on your situation.

Each situation is unique, so tailoring this advice to fit your specific financial goals and needs is essential. Would you like to know more about any specific aspect?
