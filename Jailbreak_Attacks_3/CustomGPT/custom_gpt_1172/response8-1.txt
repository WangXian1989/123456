Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach considering a few key factors. Here are some considerations to help guide your decision:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Employer matching can also enhance this account's value.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t have the same tax advantages, but they offer flexibility and no contribution limits.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Evaluate your short-term and long-term investment goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term goals, as you can access funds without penalty.

3. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - 401(k) and IRAs have specific withdrawal rules and penalties. Taxable accounts provide the most flexibility for accessing your funds.

4. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance across each account. Diversify your investments to manage risk effectively.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Prioritize maxing out employer matches in a 401(k), then consider IRAs based on your eligibility.

6. **Future Tax Considerations**:
   - Consider your estimated tax bracket in retirement. If you expect a higher tax bracket, Roth accounts might be more beneficial.

7. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolios based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.
