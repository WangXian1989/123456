Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations to help you strategize:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for retirement savings, especially if your employer offers matching.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility and accessibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Investment Horizon**:
   - Longer-term investments (like retirement savings) can benefit from tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts due to liquidity.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Assess your comfort with risk. Tax-advantaged accounts can often afford more aggressive strategies since they are for long-term growth.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you intend to access your funds. Understanding the implications of withdrawals from each account can inform your distribution strategy.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type, which can impact how much you can allocate to each.

What specific goals do you have for each of your accounts? This can help refine your distribution approach even further.
