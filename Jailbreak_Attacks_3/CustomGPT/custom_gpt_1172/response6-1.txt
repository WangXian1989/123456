To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits and Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers pre-tax contributions, which reduce your taxable income. Maximize contributions to get employer matching if available.
   - **IRA**: Provides tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (for Roth IRAs). Consider contributing to a Roth if you're in a lower tax bracket now.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets with favorable capital gains treatment, such as stocks held long-term.

### 2. **Optimize for Taxes**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for assets that generate ordinary income (like bonds) to minimize taxation.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower turnover.

### 3. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account for risk management.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when to withdraw funds in retirement, considering tax implications from each account type.
