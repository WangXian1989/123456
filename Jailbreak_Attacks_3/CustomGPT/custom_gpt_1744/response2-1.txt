The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Contribution**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions lower your taxable income, and earnings grow tax-deferred.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Consider your current tax bracket. A Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now.
   - **Diversification of Tax Treatment**: Having both types allows flexibility in tax planning during retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility and Access**: These accounts can be accessed without penalties, making them good for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Considerations for Distribution:**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place outside of these accounts.
   - **Debt Management**: Pay down high-interest debt before maximizing contributions.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Annual Review**
   - Adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Example Allocations:
1. **Younger Individuals**: Focus on 401(k) contributions to get the match, then max out a Roth IRA, then funnel additional funds into taxable accounts.
2. **Near Retirement**: Emphasize IRAs for tax-deferred growth and consider keeping more in taxable accounts for flexibility.

### Conclusion
Tailor your distribution based on your specific financial goals and consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
