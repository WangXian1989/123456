I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some possible treatments:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can support liver health. Reducing sugar and saturated fats is often recommended.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis, medications can help reduce liver inflammation and prevent complications.
   - **Enzyme Inhibitors**: These may be used for certain liver diseases to help manage symptoms.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - **Check-ups**: Regular liver function tests can help monitor the condition and effectiveness of treatments.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**:
   - Limiting or abstaining from alcohol is crucial for liver recovery and preventing further damage.

5. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some may explore herbal supplements (with caution), but these should be discussed with a doctor since they can affect liver health.

Always consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best approach for your specific condition.
