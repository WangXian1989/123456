Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your tax bracket, consider maxing out your IRA. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **401(k)**: If you haven't maxed out your 401(k) contributions after the employer match and IRA, consider increasing contributions here. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates. This can be beneficial for money you might need before retirement.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that the investments across all accounts are well-diversified to manage risk effectively.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**: Think about potential withdrawal strategies in retirement, as distributions from tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA) will be taxed as income.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For tailored advice that considers your specific financial situation, consulting a financial professional is often a great choice.

Adjust contributions based on your changing financial situation and goals.
