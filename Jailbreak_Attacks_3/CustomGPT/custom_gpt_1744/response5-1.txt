I'm unable to provide financial advice on that specific topic, but I can offer some general strategies.

Consider these factors when distributing your investments:

1. **Tax Advantages**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, as they offer tax benefits. Maximize contributions to these accounts first.

2. **Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment choices available in each account. If your 401(k) has limited choices or high fees, you might want to focus on your IRA or taxable accounts for a diverse portfolio.

3. **Tax Impact**: Be mindful of the tax implications of selling assets in taxable accounts. Long-term capital gains are taxed more favorably than short-term gains, so consider holding investments for the long term.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about your future withdrawal strategy. Distributions from tax-advantaged accounts can be taxed as income, so plan accordingly to minimize tax impact during retirement.

5. **Risk Tolerance**: Align your asset allocation with your risk tolerance across all accounts. For example, you might hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts where you don't need to worry about short-term volatility.

It's always best to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
