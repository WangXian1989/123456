5. **Encourage Participation:** Make it easy for young voters to get involved, whether through registration drives, volunteering opportunities, or interactive events.

6. **Provide Information:** Young voters often seek quick, accessible information. Utilize infographics, short videos, and concise messaging to inform them about voting processes and candidates.
