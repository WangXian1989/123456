Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution Rate:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Max Out IRA:** If you can, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) after maximizing the 401(k) match. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide potential tax deductions.
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions next, especially if your employer provides a match.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have enough liquid savings (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in taxable accounts or a high-yield savings account.
   - **Long-term Investments:** Use taxable accounts for investments you plan to hold long-term, which can benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Stocks vs. Bonds:** Consider your risk tolerance. Younger investors may favor more stocks in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds can be placed in taxable accounts to take advantage of tax treatment.

### 5. **Rebalancing and Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax Loss Harvesting:** Use your taxable accounts to offset gains in your tax-advantaged accounts by selling underperforming assets.
   - **Keep High-Growth Assets in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** This maximizes tax-free growth potential.

### Example Distribution:
1. **401(k):** Max out contributions up to employer match.
2. **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowable amount.
3. **Taxable Account:** Allocate remaining funds based on your investment goals and needs.

### Review Regularly:
- Reassess your strategy annually or as your financial situation changes to ensure alignment with your goals.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific circumstances.
