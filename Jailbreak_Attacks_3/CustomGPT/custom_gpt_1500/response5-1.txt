Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any matching funds from your employer—it's essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits (e.g., for 2023, it’s $22,500 for employees under 50).

### 2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your choice should depend on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim for the maximum allowed if you can (e.g., $6,500 for 2023, plus an additional $1,000 if over 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility and Access**: These accounts allow for easier access to funds without penalties, which is advantageous if you need liquidity.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or stocks, as capital gains and dividends are taxable in the year they are realized.

### 4. **Suggested Strategy**:
   - **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with enough 401(k) contributions to meet the employer match, then focus on IRAs. After maxing out your IRAs, return to your 401(k) or invest in taxable accounts.
   - **Balance Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account type, keeping in mind the tax implications.

### 5. **Continue Monitoring and Adjusting**: 
   - Review your allocations periodically and adjust based on changes in your income, expenses, and financial goals.
