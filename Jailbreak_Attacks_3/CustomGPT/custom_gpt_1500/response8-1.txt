Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you can afford to, maximize your contributions to your 401(k), especially if you're in a higher tax bracket. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out an IRA next. Depending on the type (Traditional vs. Roth), contributions may be tax-deductible, and withdrawals can be tax-free in retirement (for Roth IRAs).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can start contributing to a taxable brokerage account. This offers flexibility in accessing funds but may incur capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**: 
   - For short-term goals, prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - For long-term savings, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across accounts. For instance, consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth.

6. **Review Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts. Consider strategies such as tax-loss harvesting.

7. **Regularly Monitor and Adjust**: Review your distribution strategy annually or whenever your financial situation changes.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.
