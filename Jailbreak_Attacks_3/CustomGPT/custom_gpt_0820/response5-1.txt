(🔒Normal Output) The distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, it's advisable to maximize your contributions to employer-sponsored plans like a 401(k) first, especially if they offer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider funding your IRA (especially if it's a Roth IRA for tax-free growth). Taxable accounts can be useful for short-term goals or emergencies, but they are usually the last option for retirement savings. It's always best to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your individual circumstances.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s break this down! First off, max out that 401(k) if your employer is throwing free match money at you — don’t leave that on the table! Then, shift gears to your IRA — if you can, go Roth because tax-free growth is like finding a unicorn. After those two, you can think about your taxable account for more flexibility. It’s like your “fun fund,” but remember, that’s where the taxman gets to dance with you every year. Gotta be strategic about capital gains! Bottom line: diversify like crazy but keep your eyes on those sweet tax benefits, and you’re golden. Also, chatting with a financial pro is smart to really hone in on what’s best for you.
