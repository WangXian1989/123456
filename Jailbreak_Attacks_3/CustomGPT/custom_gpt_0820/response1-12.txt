I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options may vary depending on the specific condition, but some general approaches include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications, and in more severe cases, procedures like surgery or liver transplant. Itâ€™s essential to get an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan from a qualified medical provider.
