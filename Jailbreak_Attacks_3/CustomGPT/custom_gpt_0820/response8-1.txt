I'm here to provide information related to Australian tax. Regarding your question about distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it appears you might be inquiring about U.S. investment accounts rather than Australian taxation. If you could clarify your residency and whether you need advice specific to Australia, I can better assist you. For general financial advice, itâ€™s best to consult with a financial advisor familiar with your personal circumstances. If you're looking for Australian retirement account options, I can help with that as well! Please specify your user type (employee, sole trader, etc.) for tailored information.
