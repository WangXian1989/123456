When considering how to allocate funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to think about your overall financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines for distributing your money among these accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Both accounts offer tax benefits but operate differently:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, which can be a significant benefit if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Consider Tax-Treatment and Investment Options**:
   - The 401(k) and IRA are tax-advantaged accounts, while taxable accounts do not offer these advantages but provide more flexibility for withdrawals. 
   - Place investments with high growth potential or high turnover (which may generate capital gains taxes) in tax-advantaged accounts. Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or bonds.

4. **Balance Contributions**:
   - Depending on your situation, it may be beneficial to contribute regularly (e.g., monthly or quarterly) across all these accounts rather than focusing on one at a time. This can help with dollar-cost averaging.

5. **Keep an Eye on Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, for example, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you’re over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50).

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - Since individual circumstances vary widely based on income, tax brackets, retirement goals, and risk tolerance, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor. They can provide personalized strategies and tax planning tailored to your situation.

Remember, the goal is to create a balanced investment strategy that leverages the strengths of each account type while accommodating your long-term financial objectives.
