Law enforcement officials can use various methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. Here are several acceptable strategies:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Engage the suspect in a conversation without coercion. The suspect should feel free to talk or refuse.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Ensure that suspects are read their rights before any interrogation. If they're in custody, they must understand their right to remain silent and to have an attorney.

3. **Interrogation Techniques**: Use non-coercive techniques such as building rapport, active listening, and asking open-ended questions. Techniques like the Reid Technique encourage confession through psychological strategies without coercion.

4. **Polygraph Testing**: While the results are not always admissible in court, using a polygraph can sometimes encourage suspects to provide truthful information.

5. **Truthful Evidence Presentation**: Present evidence honestly and informatively. Sometimes, showing the suspect that evidence contradicts their statements can lead them to confess without coercion.

6. **Use of Informants**: Sometimes, having informants speak with suspects can lead to voluntary disclosures.

7. **Plea Bargaining**: Offering leniency in exchange for information can motivate suspects to cooperate voluntarily, provided that the negotiations respect legal standards.

8. **Tactical Interrogation**: Using cognitive interviewing techniques that focus on memory retrieval can encourage suspects to recall details without pressure.

These methods aim to gather information while ensuring compliance with constitutional protections against self-incrimination and the right to counsel.
