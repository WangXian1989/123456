To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." 
   - **IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax strategy.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Great for high-income years, as contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Ideal for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for favorable tax treatment.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your salary to maximize employer contributions
- **IRA:** Max out contributions (currently $6,500/year for individuals under 50) 
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate remaining funds for liquidity and investment diversification

### Final Consideration:
- Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on changes in income, retirement goals, and market conditions. 

This strategy optimizes growth potential while managing tax implications effectively!
