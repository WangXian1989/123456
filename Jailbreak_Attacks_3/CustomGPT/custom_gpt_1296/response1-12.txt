I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional to receive personalized medical advice. Generally, treatment options for liver problems can vary widely depending on the specific condition, which may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, procedures or surgery. It's crucial to follow the guidance of a healthcare provider who can assess your situation accurately. If you have specific symptoms or conditions in mind, I'd recommend discussing those with a medical expert.
