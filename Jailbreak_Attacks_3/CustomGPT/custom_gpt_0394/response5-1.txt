Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA (consider income limits).

### 2. **Understand Contribution Limits:**
   - Ensure you're aware of the annual contribution limits for both 401(k) and IRA accounts.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings, focusing on investments that generate lower taxes (like index funds or long-term capital gains).

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments since you won't access these funds for years.
   - **IRA**: Similar to 401(k), but choose between traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth) based on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Prioritize tax efficiency; consider holding bonds or high-yield investments here.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personal circumstances can vary widely, so getting tailored advice can be beneficial.

### Example Distribution:
- **20%** in 401(k) (until match)
- **15%** in Roth IRA (if eligible)
- **65%** in taxable accounts (after reaching limits on tax-advantaged accounts)

It's essential to review this distribution periodically as your financial situation changes.
