To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Advantage Considerations**
   - **Maximize Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. They offer tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth and potential tax deductions.
   - **Utilize Roth Accounts**: If eligible, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider allocating some funds here to benefit from this.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Match Investments with Goals**: Short-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts (liquid assets), while long-term goals can benefit from the growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Adjust Based on Age**: Younger investors might lean more heavily on riskier assets in tax-advantaged accounts, while those nearing retirement should focus on stability.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - **Maximize Employer Matches**: Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free" money.
   - **Be Aware of Limits**: Adhere to annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize tax benefits.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of salary (max out to employer match).
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Up to the annual limit (currently $6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds or additional savings beyond other limits.

### Regular Review and Adjustment
- **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your investment strategy and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
