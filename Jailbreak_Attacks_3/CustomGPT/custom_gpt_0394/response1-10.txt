1. **Interrogation Techniques:**
   - Using rapport-building techniques to create a comfortable environment.
   - Employing open-ended questions to encourage dialogue.

2. **Miranda Warnings:**
   - Advising suspects of their right to remain silent and have an attorney present during questioning.

3. **Voluntary Confessions:**
   - Encouraging suspects to provide information willingly, ensuring they understand their rights.

4. **Consent Searches:**
   - Seeking consent to search personal belongings, ensuring that consent is informed and voluntary.

5. **Surveillance and Data Analysis:**
   - Gathering information through lawful surveillance or data analysis without directly questioning suspects.

6. **Witness Testimonies:**
   - Collecting statements from witnesses or involved parties to corroborate facts.
