When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Keep more stable investments (like bonds or cash) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If youâ€™re in a lower income bracket, prioritizing Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) might be beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer without withdrawals.

5. **Diversification**: 
   - Keep a diversified mix of investments across all accounts to balance risk and optimize returns.

6. **Regular Review**: 
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in your financial situation, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
