Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

### 2. **Balance Between Accounts**
   - If you meet the maximum contributions for tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This allows for flexibility with withdrawals.

### 3. **Consider Investment Types**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Ideal for bonds or high-growth stocks, which benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends since they are taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Assess your portfolio's performance and adjust as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

### 5. **Monitor Fees and Expenses**
   - Keep an eye on fees associated with each account type. Lower fees can significantly impact long-term growth.

### 6. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - Understand the tax implications and withdrawal rules for each account type, especially if you anticipate needing funds earlier than retirement.

### Conclusion
The best distribution strategy is personalized. Regularly review your plan and adjust based on changing financial situations and goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
