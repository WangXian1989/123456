Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; otherwise, a traditional IRA may be beneficial.

### 2. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth investments (like stocks) due to their tax advantages.
   - Keep more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

### 3. **Consider Current and Future Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are taxed on dividends and capital gains. Use tax-efficient funds or ETFs.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income, making it important to plan your withdrawal strategy.

### 4. **Allocate Based on Risk Tolerance:**
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. Ensure that your overall portfolio reflects your comfort level with risk.

### 5. **Periodic Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially after significant market movements.

### 6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Before fully funding retirement accounts, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid savings account.

### Conclusion
The best approach varies by individual circumstances. It may be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific needs and to ensure youâ€™re optimizing both growth and tax efficiency.
