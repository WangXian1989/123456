Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often includes matching contributions. Tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Offers tax advantages; Traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but provide flexibility for withdrawals. Capital gains and dividends are taxed.

### 2. **Consider Your Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first.
   - **Short-Term Savings**: Use taxable accounts for funds needed in the near future.

### 3. **Employ a Strategy**
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages. Prioritize Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional funds here. Consider tax-efficient funds to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Withdrawals**: Plan for how withdrawals will be taxed in retirement.
   - **Capital Gains**: Use tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts to offset gains.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to reduce risk.

### 6. **Review Annually**
   - Reassess your allocations based on changing circumstances and market conditions.

### Recommendation:
- **401(k)**: Maximize contributions up to the employer match.
- **IRA**: Fully fund either Traditional or Roth based on tax expectations.
- **Taxable**: Invest surplus funds with a focus on tax efficiency.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the best distribution will align with your long-term financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax strategy. Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this approach to your individual situation.
