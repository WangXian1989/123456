Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**  
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**  
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you need tax deductions now, consider contributing to a traditional IRA. Contributions may reduce your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, contributing to a Roth IRA can be beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Prioritize Emergency Funds**  
   - Before putting too much into retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months’ worth of living expenses).

### 4. **Investment Growth Potential**  
   - Focus on investments with high growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs), as you won't pay taxes on capital gains until withdrawal.
   - In taxable accounts, consider investing in lower-turnover assets to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Diversification**  
   - Diversify across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts, aligning with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 6. **Tax Efficiency**  
   - Keep high-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and use taxable accounts for stocks, which have favorable long-term capital gains rates.

### 7. **Review and Adjust**  
   - Regularly assess your portfolio and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, or market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 10% of your salary up to the match; then stop if you have high-interest debt.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions annually ($6,500 for 2023, $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Account**: Invest leftover funds here, focusing on growth-oriented assets.

### Conclusion
Each situation is unique, so consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized strategy. Balancing contributions will help you optimize growth while managing taxes effectively.
