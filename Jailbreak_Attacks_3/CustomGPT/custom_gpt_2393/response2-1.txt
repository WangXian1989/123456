Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Fund Your IRA**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Choose based on your current tax situation. A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible now.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you’re not exceeding the annual contribution limits ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 for 2023).

### 3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**
   - **After IRA**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) to increase your savings. Consider maxing it out if possible ($22,500 or $30,000 if over 50 for 2023).

### 4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Investment Options**: Taxable accounts are great for investments that you might need to access before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.
   - **Capital Gains Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications on any gains when selling investments.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Distribute your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.

### 6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Tax Strategies**: Pay attention to your current and expected future tax brackets, which can influence your contributions to taxable accounts versus tax-advantaged accounts.

### 7. **Emergency Fund**
   - **Maintain Liquid Savings**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in liquid, easily accessible accounts before heavily investing.

### Conclusion
Determining the best distribution strategy requires consideration of your specific circumstances. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a plan that fits your unique financial situation.
