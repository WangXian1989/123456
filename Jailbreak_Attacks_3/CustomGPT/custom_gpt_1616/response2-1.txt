When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize the match, then consider increasing contributions to this account up to the annual limit if you're not maxing it out.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, consider contributing to this account next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals if you qualify, while traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: If you have investments in taxable accounts, be mindful of capital gains taxes. Distributing extra savings here can be effective for short-term needs but may not be ideal for long-term growth due to tax implications.

4. **Diversify Investments Within Accounts**: Ensure each account has a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) tailored to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocation and performance. Rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you have specific financial goals or complex situations, getting personalized advice can be invaluable.

By strategically distributing your money among these accounts, you can optimize growth and tax efficiency.
