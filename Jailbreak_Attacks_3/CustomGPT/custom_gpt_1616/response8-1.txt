To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts often have tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA).

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account:
   - 401(k): $22,500 for 2023 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - IRA: $6,500 for 2023 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a separate, easily accessible account before investing aggressively.

5. **Assess Investment Goals**: Align your investments in these accounts with your goals:
   - **401(k)**: Generally best for long-term growth and retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: Good for diversifying tax strategies.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for savings goals that may arise before retirement, such as buying a home or funding education.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investment choices within these accounts. Consider your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment objectives to create a balanced portfolio across all accounts.

7. **Minimize Taxes**: Place investments that generate regular income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and invest in those with long-term capital gains in taxable accounts.

8. **Rebalance Periodically**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation strategy regularly (at least annually) to ensure you stay aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain, seek individualized advice from a financial advisor to help create a tailored plan based on your financial situation.

This approach will help optimize your savings and prepare you for future financial goals.
