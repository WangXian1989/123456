Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for optimizing tax efficiency and retirement savings. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Max out tax-advantaged accounts first**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).

2. **Assess your tax brackets**: For high-income earners, it may be beneficial to use tax-advantaged accounts to lower current taxable income. If you're in a lower tax bracket, contributing to a Roth IRA can be advantageous as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Use taxable accounts for flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties before retirement age. This can complement your tax-advantaged accounts, especially if you anticipate needing funds before retirement.

4. **Investment choices**: Generally, hold investments with high expected growth (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes. Consider holding income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

5. **Rebalance periodically**: Ensure your investment allocations remain aligned with your goals and risk tolerance. Rebalancing can help maintain your desired asset allocation across all account types.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.
