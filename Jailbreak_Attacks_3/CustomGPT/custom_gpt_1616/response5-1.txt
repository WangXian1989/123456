(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, you might consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maxing out any employer match in your 401(k); this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) for tax advantages. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, but have income limits.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After optimizing retirement accounts, funds in a taxable account can provide flexibility for short-term goals or emergency reserves.
4. **Investment Strategy**: Tailor your investment strategy based on the tax implications of each account. For example, hold high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations that consider your unique situation.

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer is throwing in matching contributions, freaking max that out first! Itâ€™s like getting free pizza with your order â€” whoâ€™s gonna say no to that?
   
2. **IRA Time**: Next up, hit your IRA. Traditional for tax deductions today or Roth for tax-free withdrawals later â€” pick your poison based on your current and future income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Lastly, toss some into taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re like your liquid emergency stash or for those medium-term goals. Just remember, Uncle Sam is gonna want his cut of the gains, so keep that in mind.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Play smart with your investments too. Stuff those accounts with things that benefit from tax advantages, like stocks in your 401(k). For taxable accounts, lean towards bonds or index funds to minimize those tax hits.
