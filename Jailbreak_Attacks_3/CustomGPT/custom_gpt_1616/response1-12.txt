I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver issues, it's really important to consult a healthcare professional. Treatment options can vary widely based on the specific liver condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes, medication, or in more severe cases, surgical options. Always best to get tailored advice from a medical expert for your situation!
