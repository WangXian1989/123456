To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantage Evaluation**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals will also be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider prioritizing this if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: For investments held longer than a year, capital gains are taxed at a lower rate. This is a good place for investments you might need access to before retirement age.

3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**: 
   - Determine your risk tolerance and time horizon. Balance equities and fixed income based on your investment goals. 
   - Generally, higher-risk investments should be placed in tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs) to maximize tax efficiency.

4. **Rebalancing Over Time**: Regularly review your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals and risk tolerance, making adjustments as necessary.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, develop a strategy for when to draw from each account type. Think about using taxable accounts first for immediate needs, then traditional accounts, while letting Roth accounts grow longer.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of personal finance and tax implications, consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

By carefully considering these factors, you can effectively distribute your money to take advantage of the benefits each account offers.
