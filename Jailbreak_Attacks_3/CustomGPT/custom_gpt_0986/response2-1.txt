When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now. Consider maxing out any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax benefits upfront, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Decide based on your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed on capital gains and dividends in the year they are realized. They offer flexibility but can have tax implications.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If you're investing for retirement and have a long time horizon, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA).
   - For shorter-term goals, use taxable accounts for more liquidity.

3. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider how you'll withdraw funds. You may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow as long as possible.

5. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account type to maximize your savings potential.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Following these guidelines can help you create a strategy that aligns with your financial goals and tax situation.
