Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, whereas a traditional IRA offers tax deductions upfront.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility and liquidity but come with tax implications on gains.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Keep in mind how each account is taxed. Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, whereas qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free. Taxable accounts will incur capital gains tax when you sell investments.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your financial goals. Long-term investments might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while those needed in the short term could be placed in taxable accounts for easier access.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified investment strategy throughout all accounts to manage risk. You can have similar investments in all accounts, but consider the tax implications of each.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on performance, changes in your financial situation, and nearing retirement.

It's beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
