When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as they generally offer tax advantages.
   - For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k) plans (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older) and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider your tax situation when investing here.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your short-term vs. long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for more accessible funds, while 401(k), IRAs, and Roth IRAs are better suited for long-term retirement savings.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Fees and Expenses**:
   - Compare the fees of investments within each account type, as high fees can erode returns over time.

6. **Match Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match for 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to receive the full match—it’s essentially free money.

7. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Review your asset allocation and financial goals regularly, adjusting contributions as necessary.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a custom strategy that aligns with your financial situation and goals.
