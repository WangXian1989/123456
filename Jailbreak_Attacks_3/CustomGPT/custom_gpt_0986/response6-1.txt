Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some tips to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits. Consider maxing this out after your 401(k) contributions.

2. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This allows for quicker access to funds without penalties.
   - Choose investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Adjust Based on Risk and Goals**:
   - Evaluate your risk tolerance: A more aggressive approach may see higher allocations in stocks, while a conservative strategy might favor bonds and safer investments.
   - Match your asset allocation to your long-term goals, adjusting as you approach retirement.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor this distribution to your personal situation.
