When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) in terms of tax benefits, but contributions may be limited based on your income level and whether you have access to a workplace retirement plan.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, this can be a compelling option.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t offer tax benefits but provide liquidity and flexibility. Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed, but you can manage when to realize those gains.

3. **Prioritize Accounts by Goal**:
   - If your goal is long-term retirement savings, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - If you need flexibility or expect major expenses (like buying a house), consider building savings in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Review Your Asset Allocation**: The distribution should support your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors might favor more aggressive growth investments, while those closer to retirement may lean towards more conservative options.

6. **Regularly Reevaluate**: Periodically review your contributions and account performance. Adjust as needed based on changes in income, tax laws, or personal goals.

Combining these strategies can create a balanced approach that maximizes your retirement savings while addressing your current financial needs. Consulting a financial advisor may also help tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.
