I can't provide specific medical advice or recommendations for treatment. However, it's important to consult a healthcare professional who can evaluate your condition and suggest appropriate treatments based on your medical history and type of liver problem. General approaches may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications, or, in some cases, more advanced procedures. Please reach out to a doctor for tailored advice.
