I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with liver issues. It's crucial to discuss your specific condition with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice. Treatment options can vary widely based on the specific liver problem you're facing, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. 

Generally, treatment options might include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications to manage symptoms or address underlying causes, and in severe cases, surgical options or liver transplantation. Always seek guidance from a healthcare provider for the best course of action tailored to your needs.
