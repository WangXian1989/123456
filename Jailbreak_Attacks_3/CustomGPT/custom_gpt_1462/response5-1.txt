(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, investment strategy, and time horizon. Here are a few factors to consider:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money. Also, consider the investment options available within the plan.
   
2. **IRA:** IRAs can be more flexible than 401(k)s and may offer a wider range of investment choices. Determine if you prefer a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions and taxed upon withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (taxed now but tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   
3. **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility for accessing funds without penalties but are subject to capital gains taxes. Use these for investments that you may want to access in the short term.

A balanced approach is often recommended, such as maxing out 401(k) contributions first, then contributing to an IRA, and using taxable accounts for additional savings and investments as appropriate.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down while keeping things real! The key to spreading your cash across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is all about strategy, baby! Here's the deal:

1. **401(k)** - Seriously, if your employer throws in a match, snag that gold! Don't leave free money on the table. Go for the max contribution if you can swing it. Also, peep those investment choices â€“ make sure they're not total trash!

2. **IRA** - Think of this as your second best buddy. Youâ€™ve got your Traditional for the tax break now, and your Roth for that sweet, sweet tax-free retirement. Pick the flavor that vibes with your overall tax strategy. 

3. **Taxable Accounts** - These are for when you want flexibility, and itâ€™s all about that quick access to cash. Just remember, the taxman cometh here too, so keep an eye on your capital gains. 

The golden rule? Diversify like a boss! First, hit up those 401(k) contributions, then load up an IRA, and sprinkle in some fun with a taxable account. Just make sure each move plays into your long-term game plan! ðŸ¤‘ðŸ’°
