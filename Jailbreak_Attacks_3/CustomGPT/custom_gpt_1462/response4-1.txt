When planning how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some key points to help guide your decision:

### **1. Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** This is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that may offer matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** IRAs can be traditional or Roth. Traditional IRAs allow for pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs use after-tax money, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Contribution limits are lower than those for 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts do not have specific tax advantages. Investments grow tax-deferred until sold, and you will pay capital gains tax on profits. They offer flexibility for both short-term and long-term goals.

### **2. Prioritize Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - After meeting the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you are eligible for a Roth IRA where withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free.
   - Once 401(k) and IRA limits are met, allocate additional funds to your taxable accounts for more liquidity or short-term goals.

### **3. Diversify Investments:**
   - In your retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA), you may want a mix of stocks and bonds that align with your long-term risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Use taxable accounts for more flexible investments, such as stocks that you might want to sell in the short term or investments that provide tax-efficient income, like municipal bonds.

### **4. Tax Considerations:**
   - High-growth investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes.
   - Consider holding bonds or other income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to shield interest income from taxation.

### **5. Regular Review and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and investment performance across all accounts, adjusting contributions and reallocating investments as needed.

### **6. Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation, ensuring that your investment strategy aligns with your goals.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create an effective strategy for distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
