When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to understand the benefits and limitations of each type of account. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), ensure that you at least contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” and a great immediate return on your investment.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. IRAs often provide more investment options compared to a 401(k), and Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Increasing Contributions in the 401(k):**
   - Once you’ve maxed out your IRA contributions, turn your attention back to your 401(k). The contribution limit for a 401(k) is typically higher than that of an IRA, allowing greater potential for tax-deferred growth.

### 4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - If you’ve maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts or need funds for short-term goals, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This offers more liquidity and flexibility, allowing you to access your money without penalties.

### 5. **Asset Allocation Considerations:**
   - Diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a 401(k) or IRA) while keeping more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of tax efficiency.

### 6. **Consider Future Tax Implications:**
   - Think about how tax rates might change in the future. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket at retirement, investing more heavily in a Roth IRA (where you pay taxes now on contributions) might be beneficial.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - As your investments grow and your financial situation changes, periodically review your asset allocation and adjust as necessary to stay aligned with your investment goals.

### Final Thoughts:
It’s often wise to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific financial situation, goals, and retirement plans. They can provide personalized strategies including tax optimization strategies based on your entire financial picture.
