When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy often depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general framework to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you have already maximized your 401(k) contribution and your income allows for it, consider contributing to an IRA.
     - **Traditional IRA**: Good for tax-deferred growth, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for funds you might need before retirement or for investment flexibility. Capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments for profit, but qualified dividends and long-term gains can be taxed at lower rates.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Regardless of account type, diversify your investments:
     - **Stocks**: Higher growth potential, suitable for long-term investment horizons.
     - **Bonds**: Generally offer more stability and income.
     - **Alternative Investments**: Depending on your risk tolerance, consider options like REITs or commodities.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Based on Time Horizon**
   - Younger investors generally can take on more risk (higher stock allocation), while those closer to retirement might prefer a more conservative approach (more bonds).

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan how and when you will draw from these accounts during retirement. For instance, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 6. **Review and Adapt**
   - Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust contributions and allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market performance, and life goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **Age 30-40**:
  - 60% in 401(k)
  - 30% in Roth IRA
  - 10% in taxable accounts

- **Age 50+**:
  - 40% in 401(k)
  - 30% in Traditional IRA
  - 30% in taxable accounts

### Conclusion
The best distribution of funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will ultimately hinge on your personal financial situation, goals, and market conditions. Consulting with a financial advisor is always a good idea to tailor the strategy to your needs.
