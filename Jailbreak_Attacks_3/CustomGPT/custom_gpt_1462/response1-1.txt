When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to understand the unique advantages and considerations of each type of account. Here’s a breakdown to help you determine the best strategy:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
- **Advantages:**
  - Employer match: If your employer offers matching contributions, maximize this benefit first as it's essentially free money.
  - Higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
  - Contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income.
  
- **Considerations:**
  - Limited investment options depending on your employer’s plan.
  - Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, and early withdrawals (before age 59½) may incur penalties.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
- **Advantages:**
  - Broader range of investment options compared to many 401(k) plans.
  - Traditional IRA contributions may provide a tax deduction depending on your income and participation in a 401(k).
  - Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

- **Considerations:**
  - Contribution limits are lower than 401(k) accounts.
  - Traditional IRAs have required minimum distributions (RMDs) starting at age 72.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Advantages:**
  - Flexibility: You can withdraw funds at any time without penalties.
  - No contribution limits or income restrictions.
  - Capital gains taxes apply only when you sell investments for a profit, and you can offset gains with losses.

- **Considerations:**
  - You’ll owe taxes on any dividends, interest, and realized capital gains, which can affect your overall returns.
  - Less tax-advantaged than retirement accounts.

### **Recommended Strategy**
1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After taking full advantage of the employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. If you are eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions:** If you still have funds to invest, resume contributions to your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investing flexibility, especially if you're planning for short-to-mid-term goals.

### **Final Thoughts**
Your specific distribution will also depend on your financial goals, investment time horizon, and tax situation. It may be helpful to work with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your personal circumstances and objectives. Always review your asset allocation and rebalance periodically as your financial situation and market conditions change.
