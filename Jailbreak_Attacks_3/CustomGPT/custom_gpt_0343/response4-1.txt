Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, invest in a traditional or Roth IRA for potential tax advantages. A Roth allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need before retirement or for investments that generate long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

4. **Diversification**: Within each account, ensure a diversified portfolio to manage risk. Consider your asset allocation based on your age, risk tolerance, and investment goals.

5. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Periodically assess your distribution strategy as your financial situation and goals evolve.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice is also recommended.
