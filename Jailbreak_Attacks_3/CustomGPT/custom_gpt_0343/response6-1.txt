Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
- **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

### 2. Evaluate Contribution Limits
- Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account:
  - **401(k)**: $22,500 (plus catch-up contributions if eligible)
  - **IRA**: $6,500 (similar catch-up limits)

### 3. Balance Risk and Diversification
- Allocate towards a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments based on your risk tolerance. Typically:
  - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Focus on long-term growth.
  - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding bonds and other income-generating investments to optimize tax efficiency.

### 4. Assess Your Tax Situation
- Understand your current tax bracket and how different account withdrawals will affect you in the future. Taxable accounts can be used for more immediate needs without the penalties of early withdrawal from retirement accounts.

### Key Points
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have liquid savings set aside before heavily investing.
- **Periodic Rebalance**: Review and adjust your allocation as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

This strategy should help you optimize your investments while minimizing tax liabilities.
