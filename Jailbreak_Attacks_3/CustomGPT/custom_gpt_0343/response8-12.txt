I'm not a doctor, but common treatments for liver problems often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, regular exercise, and weight management can significantly impact liver health.
   
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe antiviral medications, steroids, or supplements like vitamin E.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can help prevent further liver damage.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging can help track liver health.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures or liver transplants may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
