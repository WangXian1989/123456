Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize this. 401(k) contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax considerations. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Here, consider:
   - Holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.
   - Utilizing tax-loss harvesting strategies.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.

5. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions.
