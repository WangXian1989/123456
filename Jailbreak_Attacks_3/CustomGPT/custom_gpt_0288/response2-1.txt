To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. If possible, max out contributions yearly to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

2. **Assess Investment Goals**:
   - Use the 401(k) for long-term growth with higher risk investments.
   - Choose bonds or conservative investments in IRAs if you're nearing retirement.
   - Keep a diverse mix in taxable accounts, focusing on investments with favorable capital gains tax treatment.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable accounts may have capital gains taxes, so consider holding long-term investments there.
   - Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies in taxable accounts to offset gains.

4. **Emergency Fund & Short-Term Goals**:
   - Maintain an emergency fund in cash or low-risk assets outside these accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for any short-term goals due to easier access without penalties.

5. **Re-evaluate Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations annually based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and age.

This balanced approach will help optimize both growth and tax benefits.
