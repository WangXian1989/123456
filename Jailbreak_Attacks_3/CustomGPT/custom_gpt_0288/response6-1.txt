Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** If your employer matches contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider maxing out a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings and flexible withdrawals, especially for mid-term goals.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** These accounts lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA):** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and realized gains are taxed in the year they are earned, making them less tax-efficient for long-term holding.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Aggressive Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Since these accounts are typically intended for long-term growth, consider more aggressive options (stocks, ETFs).
   - **Conservative Investments in Taxable Accounts:** Focus on income-producing investments (bonds, dividend stocks) to manage tax liabilities efficiently.

### Summary
Assess your financial goals and tax implications, prioritize contributions to benefit from employer matches, and consider a balanced approach to investments across accounts. Regularly review and adjust your strategy as needed to stay aligned with your goals.
