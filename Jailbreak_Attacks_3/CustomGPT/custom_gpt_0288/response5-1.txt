Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This might be a good place for investments that may generate income (like dividends) to minimize tax impact.

4. **Consider Taxes**: Tax-efficient investing can enhance returns. Holding stocks in taxable accounts and bonds in tax-deferred accounts can help.

5. **Evaluate Withdrawals**: Plan your withdrawal strategy based on tax implications in retirement. Utilize tax-deferred accounts first if you're in a higher tax bracket.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
