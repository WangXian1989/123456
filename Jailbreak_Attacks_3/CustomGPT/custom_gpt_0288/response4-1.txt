To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for higher growth investments (stocks) since gains are tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate lower taxes, like municipal bonds or index funds, which are more tax-efficient.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out employer matching in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially free money.
   - Next, contribute to your IRA (traditional or Roth), considering your income and tax situation.
   - Finally, allocate any additional funds to your taxable account.

3. **Consider Withdrawal Timeline**:
   - Accounts used for long-term growth (like 401(k) and IRA) should be stocked with higher volatility investments.
   - Keep short-term needs in taxable accounts to avoid penalties and taxes on early withdrawals.

4. **Diversification of Assets**:
   - Maintain a diverse asset allocation across all accounts, adjusting for your overall risk tolerance and financial goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level as market conditions change.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal situation.
