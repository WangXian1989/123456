Balancing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional IRA if you're eligible for tax deductions or a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future. 

### 2. **Diversify Your Investments:**
   - In tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance. Typically, younger investors may lean more toward equities, while those nearing retirement might prefer bonds to preserve capital.
   - In taxable accounts, emphasize more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or tax-managed funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you’re in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred growth in your 401(k) and IRA. After maxing these out, utilize taxable accounts for additional investments.
   - Focus on assets with favorable capital gains treatment in taxable accounts, such as long-term investments or qualified dividends.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Short-Term Needs:**
   - If you need liquidity or foresee short-term goals (like buying a home), keep a portion in a taxable account for easier access.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Reassess your allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions. 

### Summary:
Start with tax-advantaged accounts (max out employer match in your 401(k), then contribute to an IRA), diversify your investments with tax considerations in mind, and keep an eye on your overall financial goals and liquidity needs.
