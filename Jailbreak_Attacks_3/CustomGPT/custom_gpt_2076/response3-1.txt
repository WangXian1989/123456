Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions Wisely:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA, as these accounts offer tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for savings beyond retirement accounts, especially for goals within the next 5â€“10 years.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments. Holding investments for over a year can lower this rate.

### 3. **Liquidity Needs:**
   - If you anticipate needing money in the short term (within 5 years), prioritize taxable accounts or Roth IRA contributions (up to your contributions) since these can be withdrawn without penalty.

### 4. **Investment Growth Potential:**
   - Focus on higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to benefit from compounding.
   - In taxable accounts, consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies.

### 5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Individual Goals and Situations:**
   - Tailor your strategy based on your specific retirement age, income potential, and risk tolerance.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k) to employer match.**
- **Contribute to IRAs (prioritize Roth for tax-free growth).**
- **Invest surplus funds in taxable accounts.**

### Conclusion:
Regularly reassess your strategy, especially as your financial situation and market conditions change. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your complete financial picture.
