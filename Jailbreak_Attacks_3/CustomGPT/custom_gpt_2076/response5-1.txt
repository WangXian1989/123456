Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors including your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now, but will be taxed upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, making it a great option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider this if you plan short-term investments.

### 3. **Diversified Growth**
   - Allocate funds based on asset class performance and your risk tolerance. Typically, riskier assets like stocks might go in taxable accounts where capital gains taxes can be offset by losses.

### 4. **Retirement Timeline**
   - If retirement is far off, prioritize accounts with tax advantages (401(k) and IRAs) for compounding benefits. As retirement nears, consider reallocating to more liquid assets.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account separate from your investment strategy.

### 6. **Annual Limits and Goals**
   - Each account has annual contribution limits. Aim to maximize these according to your income and tax situation.

### Example Allocation Strategy
1. **401(k):** Max out contributions to receive full employer match.
2. **IRA (Roth/Traditional):** Contribute up to the maximum limit after 401(k) match.
3. **Taxable Account:** Use any remaining funds after maxing out retirement accounts for additional investments.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also tailor your strategy to your unique situation.
