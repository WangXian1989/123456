Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money).
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):**
     - Contributions reduce taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - **Asset Allocation:**
     - Mix investments across accounts to balance risk. For instance, consider holding bonds in tax-deferred accounts due to their lower tax implications.
   - **Investing in Tax-Efficient Funds:**
     - Use index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains distributions.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy for Retirement**
   - Plan for which accounts to withdraw from first:
     - Typically, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**
   - Annually reassess your distribution based on performance, changes in laws, and life circumstances.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of salary (maximize employer match).
- **IRA:** Max out ($6,500 for 2023; $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any remaining funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

By balancing contributions with tax implications and withdrawal strategies, you can enhance your financial growth while minimizing taxes. It's often worthwhile to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
