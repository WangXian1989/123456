Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth and often includes employer matching. Contribution limits are higher than IRAs.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also tax-deferred, but contributions may be tax-deductible based on income and other factors.
   - **Roth IRA**: Offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement; contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Taxed on capital gains and dividends annually. Offers flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

### 2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Max out contributions to these before moving to taxable accounts—especially if your employer matches contributions.
   - **Invest in Bonds or Interest-Bearing Income in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Since interest is taxed at ordinary income rates, it’s often better to hold these in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Hold Stocks or ETFs in Taxable Accounts**: Long-term capital gains rates are generally lower than ordinary income tax rates.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes in all accounts, considering factors like risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Keep growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.

### 4. **Retirement Needs and Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan withdrawals considering tax implications; you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth accounts, depending on your tax bracket in retirement.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a highly liquid account before maxing out retirement contributions.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match (if available).
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on eligibility.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining funds here for flexibility.

### Final Considerations:
- **Review Regularly**: Adjust your strategy as your financial situation and market conditions change.
- **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your approach to align with your unique financial goals and situation.

By balancing the benefits of each account type, you can craft a strategy that maximizes growth and minimizes taxes.
