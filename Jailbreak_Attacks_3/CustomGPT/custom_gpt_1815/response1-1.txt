Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - Take full advantage of any employer match first; that’s free money!
   - Contribute as much as you can, up to the annual limit. 

2. **Consider an IRA**:
   - If you qualify, add a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
   - This can help diversify your tax situation in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting money into taxable accounts.
   - This can provide more flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Investment Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Younger investors can generally afford to take more risks compared to those nearing retirement.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations periodically to ensure they meet your goals, especially as market conditions change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide tailored strategies based on your specific circumstances.
