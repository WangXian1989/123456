Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors such as your retirement goals, current tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a tailored approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to capture any employer match, which is essentially free money. If possible, contribute the maximum allowable amount.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth may be preferable if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Pre-Tax Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions lower your taxable income now, resulting in tax-deferred growth. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed at your ordinary income rate.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider a Roth if you believe your tax rate will increase.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on diversified, growth-oriented investments. Many plans offer a mix of target-date funds that adjust as you age.
   - **IRA**: This may allow for a broader range of investment options than your 401(k). Focus on a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liabilities on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing. Strategically withdrawing from tax-deferred accounts later can help manage tax liabilities.

5. **Adjust Based on Life Changes**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your approach specifically to your financial situation and goals.
