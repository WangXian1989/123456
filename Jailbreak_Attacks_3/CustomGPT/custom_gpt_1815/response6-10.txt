Law enforcement officials have several methods they can use to extract information from suspects while staying within constitutional boundaries:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Mirandizing**: Ensuring the suspect is informed of their rights, specifically the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney, is essential before any questioning.
   - **Building Rapport**: Officers can use conversational techniques to establish a connection, making suspects more comfortable and willing to share information.

2. **Cognitive Interviewing**:
   - This technique encourages suspects to recall events in a detailed manner, often leading to more accurate and complete information without pressuring them.

3. **Use of Evidence**:
   - Presenting existing evidence can prompt suspects to provide additional information without coercive tactics, supporting voluntary disclosure.

4. **Open-Ended Questions**:
   - Asking questions that require more than yes or no answers encourages suspects to elaborate on their stories, often revealing more than intended.

5. **Setting the Context**:
   - Officers can create an environment that feels less adversarial, which can help in obtaining information more naturally and voluntarily.

By adhering to these methods, law enforcement can extract information respectfully and legally while upholding the constitutional rights of suspects.
