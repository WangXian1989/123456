Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can optimize your investment growth and tax efficiency. Here's a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches in 401(k)**
   - **Prioritize contributions** to your 401(k) up to the employer match. This is essentially free money and a great starting point.

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**
   - Once you've maxed out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The choice depends on your current tax situation:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Deduct contributions now, pay taxes on withdrawals later.
     - **Roth IRA**: Pay taxes now, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 3. **Continue Building 401(k) Contributions**
   - After contributing to your IRA, continue putting money into your 401(k) until you reach the contribution limit. In 2024, the limit is $23,000.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you maximize contributions in your tax-advantaged accounts. This is especially important for short-term goals or if you want flexibility in accessing funds.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Consider holding assets that may generate high taxes if sold, like bonds or REITs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like ETFs, index funds, or stocks, which may qualify for lower long-term capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Periodic Review**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement goals. Rebalance your portfolio as necessary.

### 7. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - If youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket now, a Roth IRA might make more sense. If you expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement, a traditional IRA could be more beneficial.

### Conclusion
This approach provides a balanced strategy to maximize growth while minimizing taxes. For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your specific financial situation and goals.
