The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA to benefit from tax advantages. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to a taxable account for flexibility. This is useful for short-term goals or if you want to access funds before retirement age without penalties.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Depending on your current and expected future tax rates, you might prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) and traditional IRA) in your younger years, then switch to Roth accounts as your income—and tax rate—potentially decreases.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments within these accounts based on your risk tolerance and goals. Generally, growth-oriented investments (like stocks) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to long-term capital gains and dividend taxation.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your salary to maximize employer match and tax deferral.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed yearly.
- **Taxable Account**: Allocate funds after reaching optimal contributions in tax-advantaged accounts.
