To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth with potential employer matching. Typically higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA**: Provides tax benefits, either through traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility with investments and withdrawals, but subject to taxes on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Use traditional IRAs or 401(k)s for contributions if you need immediate tax deductions.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA). Invest in growth-focused assets.
   - For mid-term goals, consider a mix of taxable accounts with lower volatility investments.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changes in your financial goals or market conditions.

6. **Tax Efficiency in Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and efficient distribution of your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
