Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match; it’s essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages that can enhance your savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement age without penalties.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Place higher-income-generating investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.

5. **Diversify Your Investments**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
