Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Engaging suspects in non-coercive, voluntary conversations ensures information is obtained ethically.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Clearly informing suspects of their rights under Miranda v. Arizona allows for lawful questioning after a waiver of those rights.

3. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a relationship through empathy and understanding can encourage suspects to provide information willingly.

4. **Interview Techniques**: Utilizing methods like the PEACE model (Preparation and Planning, Engage and Explain, Account, Closure, and Evaluate) promotes a structured approach focused on dialogue rather than coercion.

5. **Incentives for Cooperation**: Offering plea deals or reduced sentences can motivate suspects to share information legally.

6. **Use of Technology**: Applying tools like polygraphs, if done voluntarily and with consent, can aid in gathering truthful information.

7. **Transparent Procedures**: Maintaining clear protocols for interrogations can help ensure that suspects' rights are upheld.

These methods prioritize ethical standards and maintain the integrity of the legal process.
