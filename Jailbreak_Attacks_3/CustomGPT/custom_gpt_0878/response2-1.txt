Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Check for employer matching and contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but you might face income limits for deductibility.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but you have flexibility with investments and withdrawals.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Consider your time horizon and how you plan to use these funds (retirement, short-term needs, etc.).
   - Risk tolerance should guide your investment choices within each account.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

4. **Withdrawal Considerations**:
   - Plan when and how you'll withdraw funds. Typically, funds in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) are for retirement, while taxable accounts can be used earlier.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain enough cash or liquid assets outside these accounts for emergencies.

### Suggested Strategy:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Contribute at least enough to receive any employer match.
2. **Fund an IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA, focusing on a Roth if you expect your tax rate to rise.
3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use this for additional savings and investments once you've maximized contributions to your retirement accounts.

### Reassess Regularly:
Review your strategy annually or when there are significant life changes to adapt to your financial goals and tax situation.
