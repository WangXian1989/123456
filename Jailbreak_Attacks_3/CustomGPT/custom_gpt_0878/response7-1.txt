Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### Considerations for Distribution

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing taxable income. Consider maximizing employer matches first.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don't have tax advantages but allow more flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have liquid savings in a taxable account to cover emergencies before investing substantial amounts.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - For long-term growth (retirement), prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA.
   - For short-term goals (buying a house, funding education), consider a taxable account for flexibility.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - During retirement, withdrawals from taxable accounts may be needed first to minimize penalties on retirement accounts.
   - Think about tax implications: Long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are usually taxed lower than ordinary income from 401(k) or IRA withdrawals.

### Example Distribution Strategy

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match in your 401(k).
   - Max out your IRA contributions if possible.
   - Use leftover funds for additional 401(k) contributions or fund your taxable account.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts based on risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider placing more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts, while keeping tax-efficient options (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

3. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations across accounts to ensure they align with your goals.

### Final Thoughts
Creating a tailored distribution strategy often benefits from personalized advice from a financial planner, especially to navigate tax implications and investment options.
