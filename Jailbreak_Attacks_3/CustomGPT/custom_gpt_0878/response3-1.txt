Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general steps to consider:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses before investing.

2. **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out contributions (up to $22,500 in 2023, or $30,000 if over 50). This can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (limit is $6,500 in 2023, or $7,500 if over 50).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility. This is useful for shorter-term goals, as resources can be accessed without penalties.

5. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - **Asset Allocation**: Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment time horizon.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts. Use taxable accounts for bonds or dividend-paying stocks that may be less tax-efficient.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation.

By following these steps, you can create an effective distribution strategy for your investments.
