Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a general approach to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching Contributions (401k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions to these accounts are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal, which can be beneficial for retirement savings.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, where contributions are made after taxes, but withdrawals during retirement (if rules are followed) are tax-free. This option is especially favorable if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
  
3. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Assets within your tax-advantaged accounts can focus on growth-oriented investments, like stocks, since gains are not taxed until withdrawal.
   - In your taxable account, consider investments with lower capital gains distributions or tax-efficient funds to minimize immediate tax impacts.

4. **Emergency Fund Consideration**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before aggressively funding any of these accounts. Generally, a fund covering 3-6 months of expenses is recommended.

5. **Investment Horizon and Risk Tolerance**: Tailor your investments based on how far you are from retirement. Younger individuals may lean more towards higher-risk investments in their 401(k) or IRA, while those closer to retirement may want to reduce risk and stabilize returns.

6. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k) contributions (with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution for those over 50) and $6,500 for traditional and Roth IRAs (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution).

7. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio in line with your goals and risk tolerance.

Ultimately, an ideal distribution depends on individual circumstances, and it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
