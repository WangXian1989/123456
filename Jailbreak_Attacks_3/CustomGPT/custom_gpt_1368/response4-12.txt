I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver health. Common treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes such as avoiding alcohol, a healthy diet, weight management, and medications for specific conditions. In some cases, more invasive treatments like surgery or liver transplant may be necessary, depending on the severity of the issue. Always seek medical advice from a professional for proper diagnosis and treatment plans tailored to your situation.
