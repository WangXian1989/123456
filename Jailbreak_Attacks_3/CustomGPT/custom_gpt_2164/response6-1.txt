To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum allowable contribution if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: Fund a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. A traditional IRA may offer current tax deductions, while a Roth provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Balance and Diversify Investments**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Determine a suitable mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance, age, and investment goals. Older individuals might prefer a more conservative approach (bonds), while younger investors can lean toward aggressive growth (stocks).
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for how you will draw down these accounts in retirement, which can affect how much you contribute now. For example, early withdrawals from your 401(k) incur penalties, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment across these various vehicles for both growth and tax efficiency. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation.
