When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these principles:

1. **Tax Advantages**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - Max out your 401(k) if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - Contribute to your IRA, especially if you can benefit from tax deductions or tax-free growth (for a Roth IRA).

2. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are:
   - 401(k): Up to $22,500 (plus $7,500 catch-up if you're 50 or older).
   - IRA: Up to $6,500 (plus $1,000 catch-up if you're 50 or older).

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: 
   - Allocate funds based on your retirement timeline. Long-term (20+ years) investments may be more aggressive, while short-term savings should be more conservative.

4. **Tax Implications**: 
   - Remember that withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, which can be more favorable if investments are held long-term.

5. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure that your overall investment strategy is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.), regardless of the account type.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Consider how you will withdraw funds in retirement. It may be beneficial to draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

7. **Regular Review and Adjust**: 
   - Periodically assess your distribution strategy and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, or retirement goals.

In summary, a well-informed strategy involves maximizing tax-advantaged contributions first, understanding the tax implications of each account type, aligning investments with your goals, and regularly reviewing your allocations.
