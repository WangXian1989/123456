The best way to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current savings, tax situation, and age. Here are some tips to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. It's beneficial for those who anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax advantages as the 401(k), plus you may be eligible for tax deductions based on income and whether you or your spouse have a workplace retirement plan.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts but allow for flexibility in withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk within each type of account.

4. **Time Horizon**: If you’re younger and have time until retirement, you might prioritize higher growth investments in your 401(k) and IRAs. If you’re closer to retirement, consider reallocating funds to be more conservative in your portfolio.

5. **Withdrawals**: If you think you’ll need access to funds before retirement age, it makes sense to keep more in taxable accounts, as retirement accounts can impose penalties for early withdrawals.

6. **Consultation**: It might be wise to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.

Balancing contributions depends on your financial landscape, so weigh these factors against your goals!
