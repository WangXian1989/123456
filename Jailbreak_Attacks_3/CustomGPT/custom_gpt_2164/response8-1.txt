When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take several factors into account, such as your overall financial goals, tax situation, current income, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines that might help:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and provides a great return on investment.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). These accounts provide tax advantages that can help your investments grow more effectively.

2. **Consider Tax Diversification**:
   - Diversifying your investments across different account types can be beneficial. A mix of pre-tax (401(k), Traditional IRA) and post-tax accounts (Roth IRA, taxable accounts) can provide flexibility in retirement withdrawals and tax planning.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Understand the tax treatments of each account type. For instance, withdrawals from a Traditional 401(k) or IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified Roth withdrawals are tax-free. Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Adjust Based on Income**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, emphasizing Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) may be advantageous since withdrawals will be tax-free. Conversely, if you expect a lower tax bracket, pre-tax contributions might make more sense.

5. **Diversification in Investments**:
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk. This should be based on your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Your Timeline**:
   - If youâ€™re younger and have a longer time horizon, you may want to take on more risk in equity-heavy investments, focusing on growth. As you approach retirement, you might shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

7. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and investment performance across all accounts. Rebalancing may be necessary to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor to craft an investment strategy that suits your individual circumstances and goals.

Ultimately, the best distribution of your money will depend on your unique financial situation, so it's important to tailor these strategies to your own needs.
