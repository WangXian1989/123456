When considering how to best distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
- **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your eligibility, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Assess Investment Options and Fees
- **401(k) Plans**: Review the investment options available in your 401(k) to ensure a diverse portfolio. Be mindful of management fees that can eat into your returns.
- **IRA Choices**: IRAs often provide a broader range of investment choices. Compare potential returns with fees to optimize your growth.

### 3. Balance Your Tax Strategy
- **Taxable Accounts**: After funding tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for investments that may benefit from lower capital gains taxes, such as index funds or long-term held stocks.
- **Tax Loss Harvesting**: Utilize strategies like tax loss harvesting in taxable accounts to offset gains and reduce your tax burden.

### Conclusion
- **Diversification is Key**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risks.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Always consider seeking guidance from a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy suited to your unique financial situation and goals.

This approach factors in maximizing tax advantages, fees, investment options, and overall financial strategy to help you achieve a balanced and effective distribution of your funds.
