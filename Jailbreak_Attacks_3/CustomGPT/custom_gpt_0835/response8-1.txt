It's great that you're thinking about how to allocate your investment funds! Here's a general approach to consider for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of it, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Aim to max out your contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) if possible. This provides tax benefits either when you contribute (Traditional) or when you withdraw in retirement (Roth).
   - Continue contributing to your 401(k) to at least the level where you receive the maximum match.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but distributions are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax upon sale, so consider placing investments with high growth potential here.

4. **Balance Investments**: Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals. You can allocate different investment styles (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on the account type:
   - Place more aggressive investments in taxable accounts to potentially benefit from lower capital gains rates.
   - Use retirement accounts for asset classes that would benefit from tax deferral (like bonds).

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your distribution as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.
