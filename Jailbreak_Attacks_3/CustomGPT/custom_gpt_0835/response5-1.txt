(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s over taxable accounts, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.
3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall investment portfolio is diversified across asset classes, regardless of the account type.
4. **Withdrawals Planning**: Think about your future tax situation and potential withdrawal rates based on your retirement plan.

It's recommended to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

1. **401(k) Boss Move**: Always throw in enough to snag that employer matchâ€”think of it as your boss giving you bonus dollars. Donâ€™t leave free cash on the table!
2. **IRA Rumble**: If youâ€™re eligible for a Roth IRA, absolutely max it out if you can. Tax-free growth is like winning the financial lottery. Otherwise, traditional IRAs are your go-to if you want to reduce your taxable income now.
3. **Taxable Funds**: Keep some cash in taxable accounts for flexibility and when you wanna dip into something without a penaltyâ€”maybe for that extravagant vacation or a new car.
4. **Mix and Match**: Diversify those investments like itâ€™s your playlist because nobody wants just one genre! Think stocks, bonds, REITsâ€”mix it up!

Just remember: gotta think ahead about taxes and when you plan to take those withdrawals. And hey, maybe chat with a financial expert who can give you the nitty-gritty! ðŸ’¸
