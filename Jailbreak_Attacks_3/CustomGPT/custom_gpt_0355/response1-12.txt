I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems often include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying conditions.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

5. **Avoiding Toxins**: Reducing exposure to harmful substances.
