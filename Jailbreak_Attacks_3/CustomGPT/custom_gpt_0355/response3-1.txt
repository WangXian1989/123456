To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are typically tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals are taxed as regular income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made post-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment gains are subject to capital gains tax; consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term rates.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. For long-term goals (retirement), a more aggressive allocation in tax-advantaged accounts may be suitable.
   - For shorter-term goals, keep funds in more liquid, lower-risk investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure you're diversifying across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to minimize risk and enhance potential returns.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio allocations to maintain your desired risk level and asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized guidance, consider consulting a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced distribution of funds that maximizes your growth potential while managing tax implications effectively.
