Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider fully funding your IRA (Traditional or Roth) if eligible, as it offers tax advantages.

### 2. **Consider Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Good for tax-deferred growth; generally, investment options can be limited.
   - **IRE:** Determine if a Traditional or Roth IRA fits your tax situation better (contributions pre-tax vs. tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Useful for flexibility and liquidity; gains are taxed at capital gains rates, which can be lower than ordinary income rates.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio appropriate for your age and risk tolerance across all accounts. For example, stocks may be held in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains taxes, while bonds might be in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Hold bonds and other income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts on your income.

### 5. **Regular Reassessment**
   - Periodically review your allocation and adjust based on your life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.
