To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Take full advantage of employer matching and contribute as much as you can to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits. 

2. **Assess Your Investment Goals**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - **Time Horizon**: Longer time horizons can benefit from more aggressive investments in retirement accounts.

3. **Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Diversification**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a balanced asset allocation across accounts to manage risk and enhance growth potential.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - **Rebalance Portfolio**: Periodically review and adjust your distribution based on market conditions and your financial goals.

This approach maximizes tax efficiency, balances growth, and maintains flexibility in your overall investment strategy.
