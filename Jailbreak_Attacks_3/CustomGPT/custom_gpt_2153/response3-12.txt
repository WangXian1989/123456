I'm not a doctor, but I can provide general information about common treatment options for liver problems. The best treatment will depend on the specific condition affecting your liver.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:  
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fat and sugar. Consider foods rich in antioxidants (fruits, vegetables).
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver function and overall health.
   - **Alcohol**: Avoiding alcohol is crucial for many liver conditions.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver disease, medications may help manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause. This could include antiviral drugs for hepatitis or medications to manage liver disease symptoms.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor your condition are important.

4. **Vitamin and Mineral Supplements**: These may be recommended, especially if deficiencies are present.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cancer or significant cirrhosis, a liver transplant may be necessary.

6. **Consult a Specialist**: A gastroenterologist or hepatologist can provide a tailored treatment plan.

Always consult a healthcare professional for advice specific to your situation.
