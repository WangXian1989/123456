To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your traditional or Roth IRA contributions next. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes. 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments expected to generate long-term capital gains, since they are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Within each account, maintain a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Adjust Contributions Based on Goals**:
   - If you have short-term goals (like buying a home), favor taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - For retirement, focus more on 401(k) and IRA contributions.

5. **Monitor and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed, considering changes in tax laws, market conditions, and your financial goals.
