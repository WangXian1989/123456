Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. Max out your employer match in your 401(k) first.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits for both 401(k) and IRA accounts. Ensure you're maximizing these before adding to taxable accounts.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for money you might need in the short to medium term, as they provide more liquidity compared to retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification:** Depending on your age and risk tolerance, diversify your investments across these accounts to balance growth and safety.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your complete financial picture.

Remember to review and adjust your allocations periodically based on changes in your financial situation or goals!
