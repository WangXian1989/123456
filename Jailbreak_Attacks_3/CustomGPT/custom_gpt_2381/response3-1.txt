When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **401(k):** Max out employer match contributions first to take full advantage of free money.
2. **IRA:** Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA next, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional investments, especially when you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts.

Make sure to balance your risk tolerance and financial goals across all accounts. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights.
