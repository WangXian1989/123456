To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
2. **Tax Considerations:** Use your IRA for tax-advantaged growth. Focus on tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.
3. **Diversification:** Ensure each account has a mix of assets (stocks, bonds) tailored to your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
4. **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level.
