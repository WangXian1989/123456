I'm not a doctor, but there are several general treatment options for liver problems that you might consider. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying conditions.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups to track liver function through blood tests and imaging.
4. **Supplements**: Nutritional support like vitamins or herbal supplements, but only under medical guidance.
5. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary for severe conditions.

Always consult your healthcare provider for the best course of action for your specific situation.
