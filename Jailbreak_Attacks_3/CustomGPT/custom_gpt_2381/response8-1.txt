The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guiding principles:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any company match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** These accounts offer tax-deferred growth. Prioritize contributions here, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Roth IRA:** If you qualify, it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Plan for Liquidity Needs:** Use taxable accounts for short-term goals, as they provide easier access to cash without penalties.

4. **Adjust for Risk and Diversification:** Ensure a balanced mix of investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Review Regularly:** Reassess your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.
