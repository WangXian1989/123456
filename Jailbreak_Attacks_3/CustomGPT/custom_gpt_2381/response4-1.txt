Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to your IRA and 401(k) for their tax benefits. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments are diversified across accounts to manage risk effectively.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Think about how you'll withdraw funds in retirement; taxable accounts can offer flexibility without tax penalties.

5. **Consult with a Professional:** A financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your unique situation.
