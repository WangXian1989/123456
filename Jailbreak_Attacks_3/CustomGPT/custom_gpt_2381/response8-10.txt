Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Building rapport and using open-ended questions can encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Informing suspects of their rights ensures that any statements made during questioning are admissible in court.

3. **Cognitive Interviewing**: This is a technique designed to enhance memory retrieval without leading or coercive questioning.

4. **Positive Reinforcement**: Offering leniency or other benefits for cooperation can motivate suspects to provide information willingly.

5. **Polygraph Tests**: While controversial, these can be used to assess the truthfulness of a suspect's statements, albeit with proper consent.

Using these methods helps law enforcement gather information while maintaining ethical and legal standards.
