Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Prioritize Immediate Needs**:
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account or a similar liquid asset, which should cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher-growth investments since they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Hold more conservative investments (bonds, REITs) in taxable accounts to manage taxes more efficiently since these often generate interest income.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Assess your portfolio at least annually and adjust the distribution of funds based on performance and changing financial goals.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - Plan for how and when you might need to draw from these accounts, as tax implications differ: withdrawals from a 401(k) or traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals may be tax-free.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A personalized plan tailored to your unique situation can be very beneficial.

Ultimately, aim for a balance that aligns with your long-term financial goals while being mindful of tax implications.
