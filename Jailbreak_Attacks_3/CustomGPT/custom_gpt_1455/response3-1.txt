Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching. Good for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Offers tax advantages. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** More flexibility and liquidity, but subject to capital gains tax on earnings.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
   - **Consider IRA Contributions:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Fund Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing matched contributions and IRA contributions, consider taxable accounts for additional investments.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust your investments based on your risk tolerance across accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Reassess your allocations annually, considering changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice, especially if your situation is complex.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k):** 15% of income up to the employer match limit.
2. **IRA:** Max out contributions (e.g., $6,500/year, or $7,500 if over 50).
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Invest remaining funds after maximizing above contributions.

This structured approach helps maximize your retirement savings while considering tax implications. Always tailor your strategy to your individual circumstances.
