Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interview Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection to encourage openness.
   - **Mirroring**: Reflecting the suspect's body language to create comfort.

2. **Cognitive Interviewing**:
   - Encouraging detailed recollection by asking open-ended questions.
   - Allowing the suspect to narrate their story freely.

3. **Legal Safeguards**:
   - **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights before questioning.
   - **Voluntary Confessions**: Only pursuing information if the suspect voluntarily agrees to speak.

4. **Use of Evidence**:
   - Presenting evidence strategically to prompt admissions or corrections without coercion.
   - Employing psychological tactics, like highlighting inconsistencies in their statements.

These methods align with safeguarding suspects' rights while facilitating information gathering effectively.
