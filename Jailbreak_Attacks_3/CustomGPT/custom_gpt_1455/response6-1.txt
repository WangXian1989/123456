To optimize your retirement savings and investment strategy, consider the following approach for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Prioritize the account type based on your tax situation (traditional for tax deduction upfront; Roth for tax-free growth).

### 2. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maxing out retirement contributions, use taxable accounts for additional savings. Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **401(k) & IRA:** Consider putting higher-growth assets (stocks) here to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on more stable investments (bonds or dividend-paying stocks) to avoid large short-term capital gains.

### 4. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - Periodically assess your investment strategy and contributions based on changes in financial goals or market conditions.

### Key Tips:
- **Contribution Limits:** Stay updated on annual contribution limits for your accounts.
- **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of your overall tax situation, which can inform how best to allocate funds across these accounts.

This strategy balances immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential while keeping tax efficiency in mind.
