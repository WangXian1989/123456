(🔒Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This reduces your taxable income and allows tax-deferred growth.
  
2. **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA based on your tax strategy. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA provides up-front tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility and access to funds without penalties. Focus on investments that generate qualified income (like long-term capital gains) for favorable tax treatment.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s break it down! The best way to divvy up your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts really hinges on your goals and situation. Here's a cool game plan:

1. **Max Out that 401(k)**: Seriously, if your employer’s matching, don’t leave free money on the table! Toss in as much as you can, up to the limit. It’s tax-deferred and can skyrocket over time.

2. **Next Stop: IRA Time**: Whether you go Roth (awesome for tax-free growth) or traditional (great deductions), just get some cash in there. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket down the line, a Roth is your buddy.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: These are your “I need cash now” accounts. Go for investments that keep your tax bill in check, like index funds that rack up long-term capital gains.

In any case, get some pro advice tailored to your unique situation, but this is a solid starting point!
