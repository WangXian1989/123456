I can't provide medical advice, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. Common treatment options can include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, procedures or surgery depending on the specific condition. Always discuss your symptoms and medical history with a doctor for personalized recommendations.
