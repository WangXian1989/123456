To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals during retirement will be taxed at your ordinary income rate.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions can be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are subject to capital gains tax. Consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower rates.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Align your investment strategy with your goals. If you are saving for retirement far off, you might lean more toward tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, taxable accounts may be more appropriate.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Diversify your investments across all three types of accounts to balance risk and return. For example, high-growth stocks might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while income-generating investments (like bonds) might be placed in taxable accounts to better handle tax implications.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when you'll withdraw funds. Different accounts will have different implications for withdrawals in retirement.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Monitor your allocations regularly and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider working with a financial advisor who can help you create a tailored strategy based on your financial situation.

This approach will help you to create a balanced distribution strategy tailored to your financial goals and tax considerations.
