The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now. However, withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k), but there are income limits for tax-deductible contributions depending on whether you have a retirement plan at work.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, making it a good option for younger savers expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have tax advantages, but they allow for flexibility in withdrawals and investments without age restrictions.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in cash or short-term investments before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Allocate your investments among various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk. Consider keeping more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

5. **Long-term Goals**: Determine how much you need for retirement and other financial goals (like buying a house or funding education). This helps in deciding how much to allocate to each account.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review your investment allocations to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions. 

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A certified financial planner can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that fits your financial situation.
