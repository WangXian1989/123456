To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: This is a tax-advantaged retirement account usually offered by employers. Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: This can be a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions but taxed upon withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (contributions are taxed, but withdrawals are tax-free if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have tax advantages. You will pay capital gains tax on profits when you sell investments and may incur taxes on dividends.

2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**:
   - Identify your short-term and long-term financial goals. Retirement savings might be prioritized, but you might also need funds for short-term goals.

3. **Evaluate Your Current Financial Situation**:
   - Look at your current income, expenses, and tax situation to determine how much you can invest and where.

4. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match – it’s essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions after optimizing your 401(k), especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you are in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional 401(k) or IRA might be more beneficial than a Roth, allowing more tax-deferred growth.
   - Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k).

6. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type.

7. **Reassess Annually**:
   - Financial situations and goals can change. Review your distribution strategy annually to ensure it aligns with your objectives and market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure of the best approach for your specific situation, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your goals.

By following these steps, you can effectively allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize tax benefits and align with your financial goals.
