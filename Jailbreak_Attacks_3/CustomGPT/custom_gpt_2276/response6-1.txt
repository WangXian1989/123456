To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions once you've met the match.
   - **IRA:** Depending on your eligibility, contribute to a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Balance Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower taxes, such as long-term capital gains and qualified dividends. Consider holding bonds and high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher tax rates.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Implement a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts. Keep higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

4. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level. This may involve shifting funds between accounts.

5. **Stay Informed:**
   - Keep abreast of changes in tax laws and investment options to optimize your strategy over time.

By focusing on maximizing tax advantages and carefully balancing your investment strategy, youâ€™ll create a more efficient portfolio that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
