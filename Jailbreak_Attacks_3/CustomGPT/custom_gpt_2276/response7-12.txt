I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. However, common treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms and reduce inflammation.
3. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplantation may be recommended.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and catch any new issues early.

Again, please seek professional medical advice to determine the best treatment plan for your situation.
