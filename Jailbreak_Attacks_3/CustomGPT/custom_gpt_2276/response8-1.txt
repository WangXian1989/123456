Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - If you’re eligible, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. Roth IRAs can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income now.
   - Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax money, offering tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 
   - Taxable accounts may be beneficial for investments you might need to access before retirement or for tax-loss harvesting opportunities.

3. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. This can help manage risk effectively.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - In retirement, you may want to withdraw from different accounts strategically to minimize taxes—consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - For personalized advice based on your individual financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor. They can help develop a tailored strategy to maximize growth while managing tax implications.

Remember, everyone's financial situation is unique, so what works best for you may differ from someone else's strategy.
