I'm not a doctor, but the best treatment options for liver problems typically depend on the specific condition and its severity. Common treatments may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can support liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or reduce inflammation.

3. **Nutritional Support**: Supplements or dietary changes can help if malnutrition is an issue.

4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function are crucial.

5. **Management of Underlying Conditions**: Treating conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol can help improve liver health.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant might be necessary.
