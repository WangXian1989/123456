Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is effectively free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out contributions here to benefit from tax deferral. Consider contributing to a traditional 401(k) if you want tax deductions now, or a Roth 401(k) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The choice depends on your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use any extra funds for taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and return. Consider which investments are tax-efficient in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds, ETFs) versus tax-inefficient ones in tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., bonds).

5. **Regular Review**: Frequently review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment across different accounts while minimizing tax liabilities.
