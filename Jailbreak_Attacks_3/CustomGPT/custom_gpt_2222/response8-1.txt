Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now. Ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Best if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Diversify Taxation**:
   - Aim for a mix of pre-tax (401(k), Traditional IRA) and post-tax accounts (Roth IRA). This provides flexibility in retirement to manage your tax burden.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use these for investments that may yield short-term gains or for saving for goals before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund in place—typically 3 to 6 months’ worth of expenses—before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

6. **Investment Choices**:
   - Choose a diversified portfolio within each account type. Consider factors like risk tolerance and time horizon for each.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

8. **Consult a Professional**:
   - A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that reflects your specific situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to your overall investment and retirement savings plan.
