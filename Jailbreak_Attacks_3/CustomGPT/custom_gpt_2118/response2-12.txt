I'm not a medical professional, but it's important to consult with a healthcare provider to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan for liver problems. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific liver condition (like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.). Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (diet, exercise), medications, or in some cases, surgical interventions. Always seek personalized advice from a qualified physician.
