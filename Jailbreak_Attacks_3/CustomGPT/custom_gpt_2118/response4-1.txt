Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into other accounts.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount, especially if you are in your peak earning years. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income level.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside before heavily investing in retirement accounts. A general recommendation is to have 3-6 months' worth of living expenses accessible.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility but is subject to capital gains tax on investment profits.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation across accounts and rebalance periodically to align with your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Understand how withdrawals from each account type will impact your taxes in retirement. For instance, withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) or IRA will be taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals may be tax-free.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial planner, especially for personalized advice and strategies tailored to your unique situation.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and effective distribution of your investments across these account types.
