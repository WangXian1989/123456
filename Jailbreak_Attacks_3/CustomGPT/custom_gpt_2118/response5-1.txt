(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Generally, here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Maximize contributions up to the annual limit if possible.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider funding a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice depends on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in these accounts for liquidity and flexibility, especially for short- to medium-term goals. Consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

Overall, balancing contributions based on your tax situation and retirement goals is key. Consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice may also be beneficial.
