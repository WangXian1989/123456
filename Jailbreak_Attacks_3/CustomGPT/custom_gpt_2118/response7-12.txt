Î± It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment options for liver problems, as they can vary widely depending on the specific condition (like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis). Generally, treatment may include lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, and weight management. Medications may also be prescribed depending on the underlying issue. In severe cases, medical procedures or surgery may be necessary.
