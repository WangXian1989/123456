When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to assess your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Contribute to Your 401(k) First**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize IRAs**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Depending on your income, you can choose a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in a taxable brokerage account. This offers flexibility for anytime access to funds and can provide capital gains and dividends that might be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Diversification**: Regardless of the type of account, ensure you maintain a diverse investment portfolio across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

5. **Revisit Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions based on your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
