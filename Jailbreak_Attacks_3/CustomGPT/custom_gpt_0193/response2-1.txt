To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Contribute to 401(k)**:
   - Max out any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - Aim for the contribution limit if your budget allows.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify. Otherwise, a traditional IRA can provide tax deductions.
   - Contribute the maximum amount allowed.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest additional funds here once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to reduce capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.
   - Adjust based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal circumstances vary, so professional advice can tailor the strategy to your needs.

This approach balances immediate tax advantages with long-term growth potential while considering liquidity needs.
