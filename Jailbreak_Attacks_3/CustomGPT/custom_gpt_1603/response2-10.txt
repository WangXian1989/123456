Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while upholding their constitutional rights, including:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Employing rapport-building techniques can create a comfortable environment for the suspect, encouraging them to talk.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring that suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and to an attorney before questioning.

3. **Voluntary Statements**: Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily without coercion or threats.

4. **Polygraph Testing**: Using lie detector tests where suspects can voluntarily participate to demonstrate their honesty.

5. **Evidence Presentation**: Presenting evidence in a straightforward manner that encourages suspects to explain or contextualize their actions.

6. **Witness Corroboration**: Involving other witnesses or evidence that may corroborate the suspect's story, prompting them to provide more information.

7. **Psychological Techniques**: Using psychological tactics that do not involve threats or deceit, which respect the suspect's autonomy.

These methods focus on voluntary cooperation and respect for legal rights while facilitating the extraction of useful information.
