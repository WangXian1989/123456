To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out your contributions to your 401(k) if you haven't reached the contribution limit. Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA can offer tax deductions on contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
  
3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
   - Assess your current tax rate and predict your future tax rate during retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket when you retire, consider prioritizing Roth contributions.
   - Taxable accounts can be advantageous for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Liquidity Needs**: Ensure that your taxable accounts have enough liquidity for any short-term goals or emergencies while you maximize retirement accounts for long-term growth.

5. **Diversification**: Make sure to diversify investments within each account type (e.g., stocks, bonds, ETFs) to spread risk.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed based on changes in market conditions, life events, or changes in your investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation, goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications.

Ultimately, your approach will depend on your individual retirement goals, age, income, and financial situation. Balancing tax benefits with your immediate financial needs is key.
