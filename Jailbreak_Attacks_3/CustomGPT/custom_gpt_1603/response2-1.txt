The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general recommendations:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. Aim to contribute as much as you can afford, ideally the maximum limit if you can.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**: If you qualify, contributing to a Roth IRA can be beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, a traditional IRA might be more advantageous as contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits and consider maxing out if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility**: These accounts can be used for short-term goals or emergencies. Theyâ€™re also useful for investments that may yield qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **Asset Location Strategy**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and placing higher-tax investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that you're diversified across all accounts. This helps mitigate risk and can improve returns over time.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Revisit your allocations annually or bi-annually to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're uncertain, it may be worth consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

By strategically distributing your investments, you'll be better positioned to meet your financial goals while managing your tax implications effectively.
