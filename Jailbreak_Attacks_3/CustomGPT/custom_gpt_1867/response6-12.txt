I’m not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options. Liver problems can vary greatly in severity and type, so a medical specialist will be able to offer the best advice tailored to your condition. Generally, treatment might include lifestyle changes, medication, or in severe cases, surgery. It’s important to discuss your symptoms and medical history with a healthcare provider.
