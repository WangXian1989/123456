Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great place to start.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like an IRA or 401(k). For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're 50 or older), and for an IRA, itâ€™s $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older). Prioritize these accounts to take advantage of tax deferral or tax-free growth.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Distributions from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, contributing to a Roth IRA (if eligible) might be beneficial, as withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free in retirement.

4. **Balance Risk and Need for Liquidity**: Taxable accounts can be beneficial for investments you may need to access before retirement. Consider holding more liquid, lower-risk investments in taxable accounts while keeping growth-oriented investments in tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement timelines.

It's essential to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
