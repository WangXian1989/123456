The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - 401(k) and IRA contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on them until you withdraw money in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts do not provide the same tax benefits, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before maximizing retirement contributions. This fund should cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

3. **Max Out Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

4. **Prioritize Roth Accounts**: 
   - If you have access to a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k), consider maximizing contributions here, particularly if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

5. **Debt Management**: 
   - If you have high-interest debt, it may be more beneficial to pay that down before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

6. **Diversification**: 
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different accounts can hold different asset classes depending on your tax strategy.

7. **Long-Term Strategy**: 
   - Consider your investment horizon. Longer-term investments can withstand market fluctuations, which is ideal for retirement accounts.

8. **Review and Adjust**: 
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions as your financial situation and goals evolve.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor may provide personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances and goals.
