The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current tax situation, retirement goals, investment strategy, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed in retirement.
   - **IRAs**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals), the tax benefits differ. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet certain conditions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts don't have the same tax advantages, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you have a diversified mix of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, consider prioritizing debt repayment over contributions to these accounts.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type and adjust your contributions accordingly.

6. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance your accounts to stay aligned with your overall investment strategy.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific situation and goals.
