To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to maximize this benefit. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After taking advantage of your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income and tax situation. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: Once your IRA contributions are maxed out, continue maximizing your 401(k) contributions, ideally up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maximizing retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Different accounts have different tax implications. Withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as income, whereas qualified withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free. Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes upon selling investments.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and objectives.

By strategically distributing your investments, you can optimize growth potential while managing risk and tax implications.
