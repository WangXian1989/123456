I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options may vary depending on the specific condition. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common suggestions might include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, and possibly medications if necessary. In more severe cases, medical procedures or even a liver transplant might be considered. Please see a doctor for a thorough evaluation and tailored treatment plan.
