To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals and Timeline**
   - **Retirement Savings**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate more to taxable accounts if you require liquidity in the near future.

### 2. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match to capitalize on free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, particularly if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket upon retirement.

### 3. **Diversify Investment Types**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Utilize options like ETFs or index funds for diversified exposure.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize tax implications.

### Summary
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Max out tax-advantaged accounts first.
- **Investment Variety**: Balance risk across different account types to achieve your financial goals.
