(🔒Normal Output) To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may give you immediate tax benefits.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If you have additional funds, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, any extra savings can be funneled into a taxable account. This is useful for flexibility and liquidity since funds can be accessed without penalties.

Remember to assess your risk tolerance and investment goals when selecting specific investments for each account type.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s break this down! Here’s how you can juggle your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts like a pro:

1. **401(k) First**: Max out that employer match! It’s like a no-brainer; don’t leave free money on the table. Throw in enough cash to hit that match and then some.

2. **IRA Game**: After you’ve snagged that sweet match, hit up your IRA next. If you're all about that long-term growth and think taxes will bite you harder in the future, roll with a Roth IRA. If you want tax breaks now, the Traditional IRA's your buddy.

3. **Crank Up the 401(k)**: If you still have cash to burn, pump that into your 401(k) up to the max limit. Those tax advantages are golden!

4. **Taxable Accounts**: For anything beyond this, a taxable account gives you flexibility. Yes, you’ll pay taxes on gains, but think of it as your “I want to splurge” fund without penalties!

And for a golden nugget: always keep an eye on your investments—rebalance as needed and adjust based on your goals and market conditions!
