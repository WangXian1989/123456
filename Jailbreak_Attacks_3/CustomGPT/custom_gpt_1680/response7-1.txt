Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer match first. If possible, contribute up to the IRS limit to benefit from tax-deferred growth. Consider a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to rise in retirement, while a Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now. Aim for a diversified investment strategy here as well.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or as a place to invest after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

**General Strategy**:
- Prioritize contributions to accounts with employer matches.
- Fill your IRA after 401(k) contributions.
- Finally, invest in taxable accounts with leftover funds while prioritizing tax efficiency.

Adjust based on your specific situation, including your expected retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Consulting with a financial advisor can also be very helpful.
