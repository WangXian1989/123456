Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few key factors, such as your income level, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions first since they grow tax-deferred. For 2024, the limits are $23,000 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Roth Accounts**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth IRAs or Roth 401(k)s, where withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is flexible and can offer advantages like tax-loss harvesting.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall investment portfolio (across all accounts) is well-diversified to minimize risk.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Adjust your contributions and allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.
