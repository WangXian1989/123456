Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **IRA/401(k):** Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. For a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, 2023 limits are $6,500 (or $7,500 if youâ€™re 50+). For 401(k)s, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 for those 50+).
   - **Roth IRA Considerations:** If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax impact.
   - **Short-term Needs:** If you anticipate needing funds before retirement, keep some money in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to balance risk and return.
   - Consider the time horizon: Longer investments can afford more risk (higher stock allocation).

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Review and adjust your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation and adapt to market changes or life events.

### 6. **Consider Future Withdrawals**
   - Plan for future withdrawals considering tax implications. Withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals can be tax-free if certain conditions are met.

### Summary
Ultimately, the ideal distribution will vary based on your circumstances, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
