When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront.

2. **Balance Your Contributions**:
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, distribute additional funds to your taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts. Try to hold investments long-term to minimize taxes.
   - Diversify investments to include tax-efficient options like index funds.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these accounts, typically 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses in a high-yield savings account.

5. **Adjust Based on Goals and Age**:
   - As you get closer to retirement, shift towards more conservative investments, especially in taxable accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reevaluate your allocations based on market conditions, changes in income, and personal financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation.
