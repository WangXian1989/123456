I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on treatment options for liver problems. Treatment will depend on the specific condition you have. Here are some common options:

1. **Medications**: 
   - For hepatitis (viral or autoimmune), antiviral medications or immunosuppressants may be prescribed.
   - For fatty liver disease, medications to manage cholesterol and diabetes might be helpful.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Diet: Following a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, and low in saturated fats and sugars.
   - Exercise: Regular physical activity can help manage weight and improve liver health.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Limiting or eliminating alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests or imaging studies can help monitor liver function and progression of the disease.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver failure or tumors, options may include liver transplant or surgery to remove lesions.

6. **Nutritional Support**: A nutritionist specializing in liver health can provide tailored dietary advice.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
