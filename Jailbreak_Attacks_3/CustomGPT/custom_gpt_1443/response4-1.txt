Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions before investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and distributions. Great for those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Use these for short-term needs or when you expect lower returns.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Age and Retirement Timeline**: Younger investors might prioritize growth (e.g., stocks), while those closer to retirement may shift towards stability (e.g., bonds) to preserve capital.

6. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on changing financial situations, market conditions, and life events.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
