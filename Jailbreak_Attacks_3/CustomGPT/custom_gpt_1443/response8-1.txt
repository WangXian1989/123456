Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA (both traditional and Roth) each year.
   - For 2023, the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if youâ€™re over 50).

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Keep investments that generate a lot of taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may get preferential tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains (stocks held longer than a year).

4. **Diversify Within Each Account**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) appropriate for your risk tolerance and investment timeline across all accounts.

5. **Review Your Strategy Regularly**: Reassess your contributions and allocations as your financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals change.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid savings account separate from your investment accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
