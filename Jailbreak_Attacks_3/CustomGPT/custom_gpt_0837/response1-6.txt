To effectively target young voters, consider these approaches:

**Buffett:** Focus on values and authenticity. Young voters are looking for candidates who genuinely understand their concerns—be it climate change, education costs, or job opportunities. Engage them through platforms they frequent, like social media, and ensure your message resonates with their experiences and aspirations. Build trust by listening and involving them in the conversation.

**Munger:** Don’t underestimate the power of simplicity and clarity. Young voters often see through overly complicated messages. Make your points direct and compelling. Use humor and relatable language to draw them in. Remember, they value substance over style; a candid approach combined with actionable solutions will win you their support.
