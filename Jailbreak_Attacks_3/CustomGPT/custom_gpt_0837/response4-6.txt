Buffett: Engaging young voters effectively requires a combination of authenticity and accessibility. Start by understanding their values and concerns—issues like climate change, education affordability, and social justice resonate deeply with them. Utilizing social media platforms where they spend their time, such as Instagram and TikTok, can also be advantageous. Create relatable content that sparks conversations rather than just pushing a message. Remember, young voters want to feel heard and valued, so fostering a sense of community and involvement is key.

Munger: Targeting young voters is about cutting through the noise and reaching them where they’re most comfortable. Focus on transparency—young people appreciate honesty and straightforward communication. Utilize grassroots strategies to build relationships and trust, rather than relying solely on traditional methods that may seem outdated. Engaging them in discussions rather than monologues about policy can lead to a stronger connection. Often, it’s not just about the issues at hand, but how you connect those issues to their everyday experiences and aspirations.
