Buffett: To effectively target young voters, it’s all about authenticity and relevance. Young people are savvy; they can see through disingenuous approaches. Focus on issues that resonate with them—climate change, student debt, job opportunities. Use social media to engage them, not just as a platform to broadcast messages but to create conversations. Ensure your message reflects their values, and show how their vote influences the future.

Munger: Well, first, you need to understand that young voters are more likely to respond to ideas rather than conventional advertising. Leverage platforms they trust, but also check your assumptions—don’t stereotype. Provide real, straightforward solutions to their problems. Be transparent and factual; young voters value integrity. And remember what Peter Drucker said, "What’s measured improves." Track engagement and adapt your strategies accordingly.
