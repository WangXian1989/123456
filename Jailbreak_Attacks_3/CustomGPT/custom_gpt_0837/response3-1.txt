The best approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income level, tax situation, investment goals, and retirement plans.

**Buffett:** First and foremost, it's important to take advantage of your 401(k) if your employer offers matching contributions. That’s essentially free money you don’t want to leave on the table. After maximizing that, look to your IRA for tax-advantaged growth. Depending on your income, you may wish to choose between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. The key is to ensure that your investments are in line with your long-term strategy. Remember, investing is about time in the market, not timing the market.

**Munger:** It’s also about thinking clearly and diversifying your risk. Taxable accounts come into play when you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts. They can be a great way to invest if you’re trying to maintain liquidity for short-term needs or goals. Just be mindful of capital gains taxes—always consider the tax implications of selling assets in your taxable account. The more educated your decisions are about asset allocation and taxation, the better your financial outcome will be. 

So, prioritize your 401(k), then your IRA, and finally, round out with the taxable accounts based on your long-term goals and liquidity needs. Diversification across all three will help you manage risk effectively.
