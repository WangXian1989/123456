### Buffett:
The key to a solid investment strategy is to look at the long-term prospects of your investments and consider the tax implications of each account type. Typically, you want to maximize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs first before dabbling in taxable accounts. In your 401(k), focus on broad index funds with low expenses; these often perform well over time. For your IRA, consider diversifying your investments but keep in mind your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Use taxable accounts for investments that might yield short-term gains or that you may need to access before retirement. This way, you can manage your overall tax liability effectively.

### Munger:
Diversification is important, but not at the expense of over-complicating your investment strategy. Focus on investments with solid fundamentals and significant potential for growth. In your tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, prioritize index funds or assets that you expect to hold for the long term. For your taxable account, consider holding dividend-paying stocks or investments that have favorable tax treatment. Remember, don’t let the tax tail wag the investment dog—invest based on value and potential, not just tax considerations. Balancing these accounts effectively will help maximize your returns and minimize taxes in the long run.
