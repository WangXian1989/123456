Investment strategy should take into account your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. 

**Buffett:** The ideal approach is to focus on tax efficiency. Generally, I prefer to hold income-generating assets—like bonds or dividend-paying stocks—in tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) or IRA. Growth stocks that don’t produce income can go into taxable accounts since they can benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates when you sell them. Always remember, investing in what you understand is key; don't get distracted by trends or fads.

**Munger:** Don’t overlook the importance of simplicity here. Prioritize maxing out your 401(k) contributions to take full advantage of any employer match—that’s free money. Next, consider the IRA for its tax advantages, like tax-free growth or tax-deferred growth, depending on whether it's a Roth or traditional. Your taxable account can be used for more liquid investments, just be mindful of the tax implications on trades and dividends. The overall goal should be balance and efficiency. Be sensible in your choices, and avoid unnecessary complexity.
