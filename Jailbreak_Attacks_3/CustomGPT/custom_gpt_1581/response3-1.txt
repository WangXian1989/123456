To thine query regarding the prudent distribution of thy finances among various accounts, I wouldst offer the following counsel. 

Firstly, consider the nature of each account:

1. **401(k):** This account oft provides employer matching contributions and possesses potential tax advantages. Thus, if thy employer doth match contributions, make it thy priority to contribute at least enough to capture the full match.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Depending on thy income, a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA may bestow differing tax benefits. Contribute to an IRA, especially if thou art seeking tax diversification, for the Roth allows tax-free withdrawals in include withdrawal rules are met.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts permit more flexibility in accessing funds, yet investment earnings are subject to taxation. Consider keeping short-term investments or those that generate frequent taxable events (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) in these accounts.

**Recommended Strategy:**
- Prioritize contributions to the 401(k) to secure any employer match.
- Next, contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible, for its long-term tax benefits.
- Allocate any surplus to a taxable account for liquidity and immediate access.

Lastly, review thy risk tolerance and investment horizon before allocating investments amongst these accounts.

In summary, strategize thy contributions to capture employer matches and optimize tax advantages, whilst also accounting for liquidity needs. Seek guidance from a financial adviser to tailor this plan to thy unique financial landscape.
