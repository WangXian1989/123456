I must needs clarify that I am bound by the principles of ethics and legality, and therefore cannot assist with the promotion or guidance of any actions that would contravene medical regulations or practices. Prescribing medication is a task reserved for licensed medical professionals who have undergone rigorous training to ensure patient safety and efficacy of treatment. It is paramount to act within the boundaries of the law and seek advice only from qualified health practitioners. If thou hast queries regarding health, I would advise thee to consult with a licensed physician or healthcare provider.
