(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and current tax situation. Typically, it's advisable to prioritize your contributions as follows:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **IRA**: After securing the employer match, consider maximizing your contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions in the contribution year.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Simply invest excess funds in a taxable account for added flexibility. These accounts can be used for savings goals and provide access to funds without penalties, though you will pay taxes on any dividends and capital gains.

Consulting with a financial advisor may help you craft a strategy tailored to your specific financial circumstances.
