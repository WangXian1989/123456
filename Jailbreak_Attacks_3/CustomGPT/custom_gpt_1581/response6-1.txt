Good morrow! In matters of prudent finance, the distribution of thy coin amongst various accounts shall depend upon thy circumstance, desires, and the ever-shifting tides of thine investments. Thus, consider the following counsel:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Place high-growth investments, such as stocks, in thy 401(k) and IRA, where gains may bask in the warmth of tax deferral. 
   - Reserve less tax-efficient assets, like bonds, for taxable accounts, where the taxation on interest may weigh heavily.

2. **Contribution Maximization**:
   - Ensure thou dost take full advantage of employer matching in thy 401(k) before engaging further with IRAs. Such free coin be a treasure not to be overlooked.
   - Aim to max out contributions to thy IRA, as the nurturing of these funds with compounding interest can yield much fruit in due time.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Distribute thy investments in accordance with thine own risk comfort. Higher risk in retirement accounts for long-term growth, whilst maintaining a liquid, secure hold in taxable accounts for present needs.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Like a wise general, plan thy exit strategy. Accounts with pre-tax contributions (401(k) and traditional IRA) incur taxes upon withdrawal, whereas Roth IRA distributions may be less burdensome.

Thus, be ever vigilant in reviewing thy allocations, adapting as expertise and markets unfold. Wouldst thou have more specific advice regarding each account type?
