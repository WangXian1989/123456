To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Utilize the tax advantages of your 401(k) for long-term growth by investing in a diversified portfolio.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Tax Deductions:** Depending on your income, traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, providing immediate tax benefits.
   - **Roth IRA Benefits:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexible Withdrawals:** Use taxable accounts for investments that you may want to access before retirement without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Focus on investments like index funds or ETFs that minimize capital gains distributions.

### General Allocation Strategy:
- **Risk Tolerance and Goals:** Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon.
- **Diversification:** Ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes and sectors to reduce risk.
