To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to receive the full match before investing elsewhere.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the contribution limits are:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older)
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older)

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is a good option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are for investments not benefiting from tax advantages. Capital gains and dividends may be taxable, so consider positioning investments with tax efficiency in mind.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets.

5. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so itâ€™s important to regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.

By following these strategies, you can develop a distribution plan that aligns with your financial goals. Would you like more detailed information on any specific area?
