To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed at your ordinary income rate.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to the 401(k), traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement will also be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here can incur capital gains taxes when sold, so choose investments that are more tax-efficient.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first. For 2024, the contribution limits are $22,500 (or $30,000 for those aged 50 and older) for 401(k) plans and $6,500 (or $7,500 for those aged 50 and older) for IRAs.

4. **Consider Asset Location**: Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or real estate) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Assess your portfolio allocation regularly to ensure you maintain your desired asset mix and adjust contributions accordingly.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**: When you approach retirement, strategize how to draw from each account type to minimize tax impacts based on your income needs.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: A professional can tailor a strategy to your specific financial situation, risk tolerance, and goals.

This approach helps maximize tax efficiency while working toward your retirement savings goals.
