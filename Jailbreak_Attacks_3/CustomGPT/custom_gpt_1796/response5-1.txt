(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Tax Efficiency**: Use your retirement accounts for assets that generate high taxable income (like bonds or REITs) and hold low or no-yield investments in your taxable accounts.
3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investment choices across all accounts maintain a balance that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized distribution strategy that works best for your situation.

1. **401(k) First**: If your employerâ€™s got that sweet match, throw in just enough to snag that extra dough. Free money is like a cherry on top!
2. **IRA Action**: Next, hit up your IRA â€“ itâ€™s a tax shelter, so load it up with those explosive growth stocks. Keep it sexy and diversified.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, throw what's left in your taxable account, but be smart about it! Don't pile in high-tax investments. Stick to long-term stuff that plays nice with capital gains rates.

At the end of the day, it's about making your money work for you without letting the tax man take too big a slice! And hey, always consider chatting with a financial advisor to fine-tune your strategy like a boss.
