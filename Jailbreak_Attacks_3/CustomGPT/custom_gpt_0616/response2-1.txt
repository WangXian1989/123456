The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially “free money” and a great starting point.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. 
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions can be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income in the current year.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:** If you're in a high tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, contributions to a Traditional IRA or 401(k) may be more beneficial. Conversely, if you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA might be advantageous.

4. **Diversify your Investments:** In your taxable accounts, you can invest in a broader range of assets, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Assess Liquidity Needs:** If you anticipate needing to access your funds before retirement, keep a portion of your assets in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on your changing financial situation, investment goals, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you're unsure about the best distribution strategy for your specific situation, consider seeking advice from a financial professional.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to investing across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, tailored to your individual financial situation.
