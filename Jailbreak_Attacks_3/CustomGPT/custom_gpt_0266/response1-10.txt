Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Employ rapport-building techniques to create a comfortable environment, encouraging suspects to speak voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Ensure suspects are informed of their rights before questioning. This includes the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.

3. **Consent Interviews**: Obtain voluntary consent for interviews without coercion, ensuring that suspects understand they can refuse to answer questions.

4. **Non-Coercive Questioning**: Use open-ended questions and active listening to promote dialogue without pressure.

5. **Polygraph Testing**: Offer the option of a polygraph test, explaining its voluntary nature. While not always admissible in court, it can sometimes elicit honest responses.

6. **Documentation**: Keep accurate records of all interactions, ensuring transparency and accountability.

7. **Third-Party Involvement**: Facilitate the presence of legal representatives or advocates during questioning to protect suspects' rights.

8. **Crisis Negotiation**: Engage trained negotiators to handle situations sensitively, particularly in high-stress contexts.

Implementing these methods helps law enforcement gather information ethically and legally.
