Distributing your money among retirement and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match.
   - Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match if available.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
   - Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high capital gains or interest income, as these will be taxed on realization.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions** until you reach their limits.
- After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, **invest in taxable accounts** for flexibility and additional growth.

### Regular Review:
- Regularly reassess your asset allocation based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals. 

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
