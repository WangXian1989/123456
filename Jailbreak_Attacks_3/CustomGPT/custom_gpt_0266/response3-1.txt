To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching funds.
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. If you anticipate a lower bracket, a Traditional IRA may be more beneficial.

2. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term**: Use taxable accounts for short-term needs since they allow for easier access without penalties. Reserve tax-deferred accounts for long-term growth.

3. **Investment Mix**:
   - **Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Hold stocks, mutual funds, or ETFs in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on capital gains.
   - **Income-Producing Assets in Taxable Accounts**: Place bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

4. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Ensure consistent contributions to all accounts, focusing on maximizing tax-advantaged options first.

5. **Rebalance Portfolio**:
   - Regularly assess and adjust your asset allocation based on market changes, goals, and risk tolerance.
