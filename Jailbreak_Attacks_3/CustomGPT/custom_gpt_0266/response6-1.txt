To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

2. **Allocate According to Goals**:
   - **Retirement**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth; invest in stocks for higher potential returns.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for money you might need before retirement, keeping investments more liquid.

3. **Diversification and Risk Management**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Adjust the mix of stocks, bonds, and cash based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place investments with high potential tax liabilities (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Keep investments with lower turnover (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on gains.

5. **Consider Fees and Expenses**:
   - Analyze the fees associated with your 401(k) and investment choices; lower fees can significantly impact long-term growth.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
