To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Prioritize a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Balance Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding bonds or high-yield stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher tax burdens.

3. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - Allocate assets based on risk tolerance across all accounts, ensuring a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments to optimize growth and mitigate risk.

**Additional Tips**:
- **Rebalance** periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Consider fees** associated with each account type when selecting investments.

This approach helps to leverage tax advantages while maintaining flexibility in accessing funds.
