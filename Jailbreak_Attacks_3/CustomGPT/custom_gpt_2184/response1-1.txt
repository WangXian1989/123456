When it comes to distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) in terms of tax benefits, with contributions potentially tax-deductible depending on your income and circumstances.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, which can be minimized by holding investments long-term.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If youâ€™re investing for long-term retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like the 401(k) and IRAs.
   - Use taxable accounts for more short-term goals or for liquidity, as they allow for easier access to your funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account, taking advantage of different tax implications. For instance, you might want to hold higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals. This ensures you stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about how to allocate your money, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your individual financial situation.

Remember, everyone's financial situation is different, so tailoring your strategy to your specific goals and needs is crucial.
