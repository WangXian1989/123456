When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Deferred Accounts First**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages that can lead to significant long-term growth.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. This offers flexibility for access and allows for capital gains realization when advantageous.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Consider Holding Different Assets in Each Account**: 
     - Place higher-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts (e.g., equities) as they can grow without immediate tax implications.
     - Hold income-generating investments (e.g., bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest or dividends, which can be taxed at your ordinary income rate.

3. **Match Contributions for Benefits**:
   - **Take Advantage of Employer Matches**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to receive the full match before considering other investments, as this is essentially "free money."

4. **Reassessment and Adjustments**:
   - **Periodic Review**: Regularly assess your financial situation and adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and investment performance.

By employing these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money to optimize growth while considering tax implications and personal financial goals.
