When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider to optimize for taxes, growth, and liquidity. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income level, you may be eligible for a tax-deductible traditional IRA or a Roth IRA (where contributions are made after taxes, but withdrawals are tax-free). Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount to tax-deferred accounts like your 401(k) and traditional IRA. Contributions reduce your taxable income for the current year and allow your investments to grow tax-free until retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to your funds before retirement. 

5. **Asset Location Strategy**: Consider where you hold different types of investments. For example, place high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts since their gains can compound without being taxed until withdrawal. Meanwhile, hold bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Be mindful of your current and expected future tax brackets. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, it might make sense to prioritize tax-deferred accounts now and pay taxes later.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to make sure your asset allocation aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Lastly, consult with a financial advisor or planner to tailor a strategy that best suits your individual situation, especially considering your goals, risk tolerance, and specific financial circumstances.
