I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Ensure a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - Avoid alcohol and limit intake of fatty, fried foods.

2. **Medications:**
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Frequent check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Medical Procedures:**
   - For severe cases, consider options like liver biopsy or imaging tests for a thorough evaluation.
   - In cases of liver failure, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
