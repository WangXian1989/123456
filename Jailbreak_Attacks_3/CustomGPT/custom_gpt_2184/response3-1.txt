Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts:**
   - Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA to maximize tax-advantaged growth. The contribution limits for these accounts vary, so ensure you are aware of current limits. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50) and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Consider Roth Options:**
   - If your income allows, consider a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This can be beneficial for managing your tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Balance Debt and Savings:**
   - If you have high-interest debt, it may be wise to allocate extra funds there before maxing out retirement accounts.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This can offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices without the restrictions present in retirement accounts.

6. **Diversification:**
   - Make sure your investments across all accounts are diversified to mitigate risk. Your asset allocation should be aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

7. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations to ensure they still meet your financial needs and adjust based on changes in your life circumstances or financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you’re unsure about the best distribution for your situation, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.

Always consider your individual circumstances and perhaps consult with a financial professional for personalized advice.
