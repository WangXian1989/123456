The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if one is offered. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often tax-deferred, which means you won’t pay taxes on that money until you withdraw it in retirement. This can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions, whereas Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose the one that aligns better with your tax strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Money in taxable accounts doesn’t have the same tax advantages, but it offers more flexibility for withdrawals and investments. It's suitable for short-term goals or emergencies.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside these accounts for unexpected expenses.

4. **Investment Strategy:** Diversify your investments across all accounts to mitigate risk. Look into a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Long-Term Goals:** Assess what you’re saving for — retirement, buying a home, education — and allocate funds accordingly. For long-term goals, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Review and Rebalance:** Regularly check your allocations and make adjustments based on market performance, changes in income, or shifts in your personal financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your unique situation and help you formulate a comprehensive strategy.
