(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon for retirement. Here are some considerations: 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, itâ€™s usually wise to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as thatâ€™s essentially free money. Since contributions are pre-tax, this can also reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, making them a great option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later. Traditional IRAs provide tax advantages now but are taxed during withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: This can be a good place for additional investments after maxing out retirement accounts. Investments in a taxable account are subject to capital gains tax, but you have more flexibility with withdrawals.

It's generally advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like the 401(k) and IRA before contributing significantly to a taxable account. Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies that suit your unique situation.

Well, first off, if your employer has a 401(k) match, slam in enough to grab that free moneyâ€”think of it as a bonus level! After that, decide between a traditional IRA or a Roth. If you believe you'll be rolling in dough when you retire, the Roth is your buddy since you wonâ€™t want to pay taxes on those sweet gains later!

Now, once youâ€™ve filled up the retirement slots, itâ€™s time for the taxable account! This is where you can play a bit more freelyâ€”buy those stocks, ETFs, or whatever else floats your boat. Just remember: youâ€™ll pay capital gains taxes on your profits, but hey, at least you can access that cash whenever you want! Just keep your goals, risk tolerance, and time frame in mind, and youâ€™ll be cruising toward financial victory!
