The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts hinges on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to capture the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After securing the employer match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Continue Contributions to Your 401(k)**: If you still have funds available, continue to contribute to your 401(k), especially if you're under age 50, as limits are higher.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you max out your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider investing in taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility because you can withdraw funds without penalties before retirement age. 

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider the type of investments you hold in each account. Generally, it's wise to hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax exposure.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on market conditions, changes in income, and shifts in your investment goals.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor to develop a tailored plan that aligns with your individual needs and circumstances.
