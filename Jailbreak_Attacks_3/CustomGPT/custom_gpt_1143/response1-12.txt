I'm not a doctor, but it's really important to consult with a healthcare professional regarding liver problems. Treatment options can vary based on the specific liver condition, but they might include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in severe cases, procedures like surgery. It's essential to get personalized advice from a medical expert.
