To optimize your distribution of money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (this is essentially "free money").
   - Max out your IRA contributions next, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you qualify for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Situations:**
   - Use your 401(k) for current high-income years to reduce taxable income.
   - Shift to a taxable account if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Investment Strategies:**
   - Consider holding higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to let them grow without tax implications.
   - Utilize tax-efficient investments in your taxable accounts, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

By strategically distributing your investments in this manner, you can effectively manage your portfolio for long-term growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
