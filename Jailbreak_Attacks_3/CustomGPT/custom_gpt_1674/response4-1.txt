Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is a crucial decision for maximizing your investments and minimizing tax liabilities. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how you might consider allocating funds across these accounts:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - **Employer Match**: First and foremost, if your employer offers a match, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. If you have a Roth 401(k) option, consider your tax situation now versus retirement to decide between pre-tax or post-tax contributions.

2. **IRA Accounts**: 
   - **Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA**: Depending on your income and tax situation, you could consider contributing to a traditional IRA (which provides tax-deferred growth) or a Roth IRA (which allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement). Assess the contribution limits and eligibility based on your income.
   - **Investment Options**: IRAs typically offer a broader range of investment choices compared to 401(k)s, which can allow for more diversified portfolios.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - **Flexibility**: Once you have maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, a taxable account may become an attractive option. This account provides liquidity and flexibility for your investment strategy.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be aware of capital gains taxes when selling investments in a taxable account. Consider holding investments longer to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### Suggested Order of Contributions:
- Start with maximizing the employer match in your 401(k).
- Then, contribute to an IRA (preferably Roth if you qualify).
- After maxing out IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) to reach the contribution limit.
- Finally, funnel any leftover funds into your taxable accounts for additional growth.

### Key Considerations:
- **Risk Tolerance**: Consider your risk tolerance across the accounts. You might take more aggressive positions in your taxable accounts due to the flexibility to withdraw funds without penalty.
- **Retirement Timeline**: The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative your investments might become, particularly in tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Tax Strategies**: Utilize tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts and consider your withdrawal strategy in retirement to manage your tax liabilities efficiently.

By carefully considering how to distribute your investments across these accounts, you can build a strong foundation for your financial future while minimizing taxes along the way.
