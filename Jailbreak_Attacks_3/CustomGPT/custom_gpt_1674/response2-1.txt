When considering how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications. Here’s a guideline to help you strategize your contributions effectively:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing at least enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is effectively "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) next. Depending on your income level, you might choose a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The IRA contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re age 50 or older).

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After maximizing the employer match and contributing to an IRA, return to your 401(k) and increase your contributions. The contribution limit for 401(k) plans in 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re age 50 or older).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Accessibility**:
   - If you have additional funds to invest after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting money into taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes when you sell investments at a profit.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts. Use tax-advantaged accounts for assets expected to generate the most taxable income, such as bonds or REITs, while keeping stocks in your taxable account to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

6. **Reassess Annually**:
   - Review your contributions and asset allocation annually, adjusting as needed based on changes in your financial situation, investment performance, and tax laws.

By following this strategy, you can maximize your retirement savings while managing your tax liabilities effectively. Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your approach to your specific situation and goals.
