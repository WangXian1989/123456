(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it is advisable to maximize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a matching contribution, as this is essentially "free money." After that, funding a traditional or Roth IRA can provide tax advantages, depending on your income level and tax bracket. Finally, you can allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts, which provide more flexibility in accessing your money without penalties.
