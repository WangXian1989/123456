To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Max out your 401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA**: Depending on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.

2. **Balance Contributions**:
   - If you can max out both accounts, do so. Otherwise, prioritize based on your current tax situation:
     - **High-income years**: Focus on 401(k) or Traditional IRA for tax reduction now.
     - **Lower-income years**: Consider a Roth IRA for future tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility for early withdrawals or emergencies.
   - Use tax-efficient investments to minimize taxes (e.g., index funds or ETFs).

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts. Use tax-efficient assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts and bonds in tax-advantaged accounts, as interest income is taxed at ordinary income rates.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your financial goals.

### Conclusion
Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, then allocate extra funds to taxable accounts for flexibility. Tailor your investment strategy based on your tax situation and retirement goals.
