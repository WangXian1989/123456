Certainly! Here’s a concise guide on how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k):** Tax-deferred growth; often includes employer matching.
   - **IRA:** Tax-deferred growth (Traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Taxed on interest, dividends, and capital gains.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k) to Max Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider maxing out a Roth or Traditional IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest excess funds once you’ve utilized tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & IRA):** Ideal for long-term investments; you pay taxes on withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Spread investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Rebalance Periodically:** Adjust allocations to maintain your desired risk levels.

### 5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**
   - **Long-Term (Retirement):** Focus on tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for liquidity without penalties.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. Max out 401(k) contributions up to the match.
2. Contribute to IRA if eligible, focusing on the one that aligns with your tax situation.
3. Invest any additional savings in your taxable account.

### Key Takeaway
Balance your investments while maximizing tax advantages, and adjust based on your financial goals and changing circumstances!
