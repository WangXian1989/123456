Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out contributions, especially for tax-advantaged growth.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Good for long-term growth without immediate tax burden.
   - **Taxable accounts:** Use for liquidity or if you expect to need funds in the near term. 

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **High-growth investments (stocks):** Preferably held in tax-deferred accounts to avoid immediate taxation on gains.
   - **Income-producing assets (bonds):** Consider placing in taxable accounts to capitalize on lower tax rates on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - **Consider the order of withdrawals:** Generally, itâ€™s more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, leaving Roth accounts for last if you have them.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals, adjusting contributions as necessary.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
