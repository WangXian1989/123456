To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer match; contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA**: Can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages but offer flexibility.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After the match, aim to max out your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA, to benefit from tax-free growth.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.
   - Hold higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce your tax burden.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Review your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on your financial goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized strategies, consider talking to a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your situation.

This strategy can help maximize your long-term growth potential while managing taxes effectively.
