I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Improve diet, increase exercise, and avoid alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).
3. **Supplements**: Some people use milk thistle or vitamin E, but check with a doctor first.
4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
