I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver, or cirrhosis), doctors may prescribe antiviral drugs or medications to manage symptoms.

3. **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies can help monitor liver function and progression.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
