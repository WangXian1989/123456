Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves consideration of several factors. Here’s a strategy that you might find effective:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Continue to Max Out 401(k)**: After securing your IRA contributions, funnel additional funds into your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need access to before retirement. Consider tax efficiency; invest in index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Subsequent Prioritization**: If you’re maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate leftover funds to taxable accounts. Focus on assets that generate lower taxable income to reduce your tax burden.

6. **Asset Location Strategy**: Consider the types of investments you hold in each account:
   - Place high-growth, higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., stocks).
   - Keep bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to benefit from lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

7. **Rebalance Annually**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on performance, changing goals, and market conditions.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your personal financial situation.
