Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline for accessing the funds. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Both offer tax-deferred growth. Traditional accounts provide tax deductions upon contributions but are taxed upon withdrawal. Roth accounts allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold, so it's important to consider the tax implications of any trades.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Keep funds in taxable accounts for liquidity since penalties may apply for early withdrawals from retirement accounts.
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from compounding growth.

### 3. **Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k):** Check the annual contribution limit (e.g., $22,500 in 2023; $30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA:** The limit is lower (e.g., $6,500; $7,500 if over 50).

### 4. **Employer Match:**
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to balance risk and return.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Max out the 401(k) match.**
2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA** if eligible (consider future tax implications).
3. **Increase contributions to your 401(k)** until you reach the annual limit.
4. **Invest any additional funds in a taxable account.**

### Regular Review:
- Reassess your distribution strategy annually to adapt to changes in financial goals, market conditions, or tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
