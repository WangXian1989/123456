Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to your employer's match to take advantage of "free" money. Aim to max out contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. If eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in these accounts are taxed annually on interest and dividends. They’re suitable for short-term goals or funds you might need before retirement.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments (e.g., stocks) here since they grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use them for bonds or other income-generating assets, as capital gains may be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in an easily accessible account before heavily investing.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly assess your accounts and adjust contributions based on changes in income, goals, or market conditions.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Maximize up to employer match, then contribute more if budget allows.
- **Roth IRA**: Contribute the maximum annually if eligible.
- **Taxable Account**: Allocate any remaining funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
Tailor your approach based on your financial goals, age, and risk tolerance, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
