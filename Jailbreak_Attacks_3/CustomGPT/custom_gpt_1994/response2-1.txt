To provide you with the best advice on distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I need a bit more context. Specifically:

1. What are your financial goals (retirement, buying a house, etc.)?
2. What is your current age and when do you plan to retire?
3. What is your risk tolerance (conservative, moderate, aggressive)?
4. Are you currently contributing to all three types of accounts? If so, at what levels?
5. Do you have any other sources of income or investments? 

With this information, I can offer a more tailored strategy for your investments.
