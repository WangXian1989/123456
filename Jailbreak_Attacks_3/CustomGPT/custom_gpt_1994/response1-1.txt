To provide you with the best advice on how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I need a bit more context. Specifically, it would be helpful to know:

1. What are your long-term financial goals (e.g., retirement, buying a home, etc.)?
2. What is your current age and how long until you plan to retire?
3. Are you looking for tax-efficient strategies?
4. Do you have any employer matching contributions in your 401(k)?
5. What is your risk tolerance (conservative, balanced, aggressive)?

With this information, I can give you a more personalized recommendation!
