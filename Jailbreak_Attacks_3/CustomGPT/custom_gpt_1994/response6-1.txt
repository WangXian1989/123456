To provide a personalized answer regarding the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I would need a bit more context. 

Could you share details about:
- Your age and retirement goals
- Your current income and tax bracket
- Any employer matching contributions in your 401(k)
- Your risk tolerance (conservative, moderate, aggressive)

With this information, I can give you a tailored strategy!
