I'm sorry to hear that you're having a liver problem. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment. 

Treatment options for liver issues can vary widely based on the specific condition, but some common approaches include:

1. **Medication**: Depending on the liver disease, medications may help manage symptoms or treat the underlying causes. For example, antiviral medications for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

2. **Lifestyle changes**: Adopting a healthy lifestyle can significantly impact liver health. This includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and monitoring liver function tests help track the progression of liver disease.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical interventions such as liver transplant may be considered.

5. **Supplements and vitamins**: Some doctors may recommend specific vitamins or supplements, like vitamin E for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, but always consult before starting any supplements.

Always seek medical advice tailored to your specific condition.
