I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options often vary based on the specific condition. Generally, they may include:

1. **Medication:** Depending on the issue, medications can help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

2. **Dietary Changes:** A balanced diet low in fat and sugar, and high in fruits and vegetables can support liver health.

3. **Lifestyle Modifications:** Reducing alcohol intake, quitting smoking, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver function.

4. **Regular Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver health and adjust treatment as necessary.

5. **Surgery:** In severe cases, such as liver cancer or significant damage, surgical options may be needed.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a tailored treatment plan specific to your situation.
