Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

### 1. Maximize Contributions
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **IRA:** If eligible, maximize contributions to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.

### 2. Tax Considerations
- **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are typically tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
- **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains taxes; consider placing investments with lower expected turnover or dividends here.

### 3. Asset Allocation
- **401(k) and IRA:** Consider investing in long-term growth assets (stocks) for tax-deferred growth.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-exempt bonds, to minimize tax liability.

### 4. Evaluate your Goals and Timeline
- **Short-term Needs:** Keep cash or low-risk investments in taxable accounts.
- **Long-term Growth:** Focus on growth-oriented investments within your retirement accounts.

### Summary
- Prioritize employer-matched 401(k) contributions.
- Focus on tax advantages for IRAs based on your tax situation.
- Use taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity with tax-efficient investments.

Regularly review and adjust your strategy based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.
