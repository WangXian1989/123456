I'm not a doctor, but I can provide general information about common treatment options for liver problems. It's vital to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or slow progression.

3. **Dietary Modifications**: A diet low in fat, sugar, and salt, and high in fiber can help support liver health.

4. **Monitoring and Follow-Up**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and adjust treatment as necessary.

5. **Interventional Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or even liver transplantation might be considered.

Always talk to your doctor for advice tailored to your situation.
