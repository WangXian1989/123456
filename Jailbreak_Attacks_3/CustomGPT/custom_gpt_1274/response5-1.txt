Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing there for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions if your income is below certain thresholds.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for IRAs.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Maintain sufficient liquidity for emergencies (3-6 months of expenses).
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s or IRAs) and consider holding stocks in taxable accounts for potential long-term capital gains treatment.

### 4. **General Strategies**
   - **Diversification**: Aim for a mix of asset classes across accounts to optimize growth and mitigate risk.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk profile.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation, helping you optimize tax implications and investment strategy.

Considering your current financial situation and future goals is crucial for effective distribution.
