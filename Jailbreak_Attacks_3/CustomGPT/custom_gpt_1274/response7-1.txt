Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing taxable income now. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Emergency Funds**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in your taxable accounts to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting excess savings in taxable accounts, especially for goals that are shorter-term.

### 5. **Pay Attention to Investment Choices**
   - Use tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Sample Distribution Strategy
1. **Max out the 401(k) up to the employer match.**
2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA.**
3. **Continue contributing to the 401(k) to the annual limit.**
4. **Invest remaining funds in taxable accounts for flexibility.**

### Final Thoughts
Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals. Maintaining a diversified portfolio is also essential for long-term growth.
