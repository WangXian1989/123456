Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) and IRA Contributions**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing up to the annual limit if you can. It's pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, contribute to an IRA or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain 3-6 months of living expenses in a high-yield savings account for emergencies before investing heavily.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you may need in the short term or for investments that generate favorable tax treatment, like index funds or ETFs with low turnover.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Taxable accounts can be advantageous for investments that produce qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your asset allocation and re-balance as necessary based on performance and changes in financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your specific needs.
