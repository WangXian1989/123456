Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) next, especially if it offers a variety of investment options and low fees.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax bracket. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs may provide a tax deduction now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These are beneficial for short-term goals and provide more flexibility in accessing funds.

4. **Consider Investment Strategies**:
   - In tax-advantaged accounts, you might hold investments that generate ordinary income (e.g., bonds) since they won’t be taxed until withdrawal.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs that minimize capital gains distributions.

5. **Reassess Yearly**: Regularly review your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, especially regarding tax implications and investment strategies, consider consulting with a financial professional.

Adjust your strategy as your financial situation evolves and keep your long-term goals in mind.
