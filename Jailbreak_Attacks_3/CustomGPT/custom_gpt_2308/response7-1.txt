To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold and taxes on any dividends or interest earned.

2. **Contribute to Employer Match First**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to maximize that benefit. Itâ€™s essentially "free money."

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After employer matching, focus on fully funding your IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

4. **Evaluate Your Investment Goals**: Consider your financial goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Higher-risk investments may be better suited for long-term accounts like a 401(k) or IRA.

5. **Consider a Balanced Portfolio**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account. Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your accounts to ensure your asset allocation remains in line with your goals, especially after market fluctuations.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your individual situation, including taxes, retirement plans, and investment strategy.

By effectively balancing contributions and diversifying your investments across these accounts, you can optimize your long-term growth while managing risk and tax implications.
