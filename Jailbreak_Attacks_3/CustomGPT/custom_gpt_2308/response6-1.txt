To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Prioritize contributions up to the employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or municipal bonds.
   - Balance your investments to minimize taxes by placing more tax-efficient assets in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, REITs) to reduce risk while aiming for growth.

### 4. **Revisit Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changing financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation and goals.

By strategically allocating your assets, you can enhance growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities.
