Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k):** Maximize contributions to your employer's 401(k), especially if there’s a match. This allows for tax-deferred growth and can reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Consider opening an IRA if you haven’t already. A Traditional IRA can offer tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your expected future tax rate.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement age or for funds that may grow significantly, as capital gains taxes apply.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments are diversified across these accounts to manage risk and ensure growth.

5. **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these recommendations to your specific needs.
