When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several strategies can help you maximize your investment growth while managing your tax obligations. Here's a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Contribute to your 401(k)**: Take advantage of any employer match first. This is essentially free money and provides tax-deferred growth.
   - **Fund your IRA**: Depending on your income, you might qualify for a tax deduction on contributions, which can help reduce your taxable income.

2. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Often have a range of investment options (stocks, bonds, mutual funds). It's wise to diversify your assets based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies (like index funds) to minimize capital gains tax issues, as you'll be taxed annually on earnings and dividends.

Overall, balancing contributions between these accounts based on your financial situation, tax considerations, and retirement goals is essential. Consulting a financial advisor can give personalized insights tailored to your needs.
