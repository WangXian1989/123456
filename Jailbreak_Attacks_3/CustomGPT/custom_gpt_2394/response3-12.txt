I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, which can vary based on the specific condition (like fatty liver, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.):

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver health.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis.
   - Medications to control symptoms or complications from liver diseases.
   
3. **Monitoring and Management**: 
   - Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: 
   - Some may benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but consult a doctor first.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
