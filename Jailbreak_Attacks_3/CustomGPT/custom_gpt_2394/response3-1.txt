Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. Understand Each Account Type:
- **401(k)**: Tax-deferred, often with employer matching. Good for high contribution limits.
- **IRA**: Also tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth). Lower contribution limits than a 401(k).
- **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but flexible for withdrawals. Capital gains taxes apply.

### 2. Contribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—this is essentially free money.
- **Consider IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA next, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Fill Up 401(k)**: After maximizing matched contributions and IRA funding, contribute more to your 401(k) to take advantage of tax deferral.

### 3. Diversification:
- Maintain a diversified portfolio within each account type, considering factors like your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 4. Tax Efficiency:
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) and consider tax harvesting strategies to minimize capital gains.
- **IRA/401(k)**: These are ideal for holding higher-growth assets that may generate taxable income.

### 5. Regular Review and Rebalance:
- Monitor your investments regularly and adjust contributions based on market performance, changes in income, and financial goals.

### Example Distribution Model:
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20%

### Conclusion:
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your unique situation, as individual circumstances can significantly influence the best distribution strategy.
