Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several strategic considerations. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax or after-tax (Roth).
   - **IRA**: Individual retirement accounts, which can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax). 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Money invested outside retirement accounts, subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is free money and should be prioritized.

### 3. **Contribute to IRAs**
   - Consider maxing out contributions to your IRA (either type depending on your tax situation) once you’ve captured the full 401(k) match. This provides tax advantages and more investment options.

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement or for investments that generate lower taxes (e.g., index funds or municipal bonds).

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth options (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) for tax-free withdrawals later.

### 6. **Asset Allocation**
   - Adjust your investment strategy based on the account type. For tax-advantaged accounts, focus on growth-oriented investments. In taxable accounts, prioritize tax-efficient investments.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and rebalance your portfolio annually to ensure your allocations align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider professional guidance to tailor your distribution strategy based on your financial situation, goals, and tax implications.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of salary and up to the match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any excess funds, focusing on emergency savings or investment opportunities.

### Conclusion
Each individual’s situation is distinct. Personalize your strategy based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline.
