Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly impact your long-term financial health. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income level, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

### 2. **Diversify Investments Wisely**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of stock and bond funds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth account, you might choose different types of investments. A Roth IRA may be better for more aggressive growth since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets with favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains and qualified dividends. Consider tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds or ETFs).

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - Align your investments with your retirement timeline. Younger investors might lean more heavily into equities for growth, while those closer to retirement may want to shift toward more stable investments.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, while tax-advantaged accounts have rules that may affect when you can withdraw without taxes or penalties.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your investment allocations across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### Summary
Begin by maximizing tax-advantaged accounts and diversifying your investments based on your risk tolerance and goals, while keeping an eye on your time horizon for retirement. Regular rebalancing ensures that your investments stay aligned with your financial objectives.
