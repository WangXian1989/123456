Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)
- **Contribution**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA (traditional or Roth) for additional tax advantages. 
  - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions; taxes paid upon withdrawal.
  - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

### 3. Assess Your Tax Situation
- **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts are more flexible for withdrawals but may incur capital gains taxes. Save these for goals that are closer in time, like buying a home or funding education.

### 4. Diversification and Investment Strategy
- **Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your target asset allocation.

### 5. Consider Withdrawal Strategies
- **Withdrawal Order**: In retirement, consider the order of withdrawals to minimize taxes: 
  - Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.
  - Use tax-deferred accounts later to secure tax advantages.

### 6. Contribution Limits and Rules
- Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and any income restrictions for IRAs.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the best distribution strategy depends on your individual circumstances. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your needs and goals.
