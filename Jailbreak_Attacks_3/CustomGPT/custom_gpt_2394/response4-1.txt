Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA:** Depending on your income level and tax bracket, consider contributing to an IRA. 
     - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a **Roth IRA** (taxes paid now, tax-free withdrawals later) might be beneficial.
     - If you prefer to lower your taxable income now, a **Traditional IRA** (taxes paid upon withdrawal) would be better.

### 3. **Max Out Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Aim to max out your contributions once you’ve met any matching requirements.
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions to your IRA as well, if possible.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable brokerage account to allow for more investment flexibility and access to funds without penalty.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

### 6. **Emergency Funds**
   - Ensure you maintain an emergency fund separate from these investment accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Lastly, for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstance, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

This strategy balances short-term flexibility and long-term growth potential while maximizing tax benefits.
