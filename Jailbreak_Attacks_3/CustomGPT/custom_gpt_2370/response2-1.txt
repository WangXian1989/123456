To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic approach:

### 1. Understand Each Account Type

- **401(k):** Typically offered by employers, these accounts allow you to contribute pre-tax income, reducing your taxable income for the year. They often come with employer matching contributions, which is essentially free money!
  
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** IRAs can be traditional (tax-deductible contributions, taxes on withdrawals) or Roth (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals). Choosing between these depends on your current and expected future tax rates.

- **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts don’t have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts, but they offer more flexibility. You can withdraw money anytime without penalties, making them a good place for emergency funds or short-term investments.

### 2. Set Your Goals

Decide what you are saving for:
- **Retirement:** Focus on maximizing tax-advantaged options like 401(k)s and IRAs.
- **Short to Medium-term Goals:** Consider taxable accounts for more accessible investments.

### 3. Contribution Strategy

- **Max Out Employer Match First:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. If your employer matches up to 5%, aim to contribute at least that much.
  
- **IRA Contributions:** If you haven't maxed out your IRA contributions (currently $6,000, or $7,000 if you're over 50), prioritize funding this next. If you qualify for a Roth, consider this option if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

- **Go Back to Your 401(k):** After maxing out your IRA contributions, redirect additional savings back to your 401(k) until you reach the contribution limit (currently $22,500, or $30,000 for those over 50).

- **Taxable Accounts for Extra Savings:** Once you’ve maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable account for additional savings or investments, keeping in mind the tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

### 4. Adjust Based on Your Tax Situation

Consider your tax bracket:
- Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher tax brackets to shield income.
- In lower tax brackets, taxable accounts may offer more flexibility, since capital gains could be taxed at a lower rate.

### 5. Diversify Investments

Regardless of the account type, maintain a diversified investment strategy:
- **Stocks for Growth:** Consider higher risk investments in your retirement accounts where you have time to recover from potential downturns.
- **Bonds for Stability:** Use taxable accounts for more stable income-producing assets and for those closer to retirement.

### Conclusion

Strategically distributing your finances across these accounts means maximizing your tax advantages while ensuring you have access to funds when you need them. Regularly review your portfolio and adjust contributions as needed to stay aligned with your financial goals.
