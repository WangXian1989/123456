Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is an important financial decision that can affect your retirement savings, taxes, and overall investment strategy. Here are some key points to consider:

### 1. Understand Account Types
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Available for individuals, with tax advantages. Contributions can be either pre-tax (Traditional IRA) or after-tax (Roth IRA).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts that do not have tax advantages. You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in the year they are realized.

### 2. Maximize Employer Match
If you have a 401(k) with employer matching, consider contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free” money, and it can significantly boost your retirement savings.

### 3. Contribution Limits
Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023:
   - **401(k)**: Up to $22,500 (plus $7,500 if you’re age 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Up to $6,500 (plus $1,000 if you’re age 50 or older).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No limit, but keep in mind tax implications.

### 4. Consider Tax Implications
- **Pre-tax contributions** in a 401(k) or Traditional IRA lower your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal.
- **Roth IRA contributions** are made with after-tax dollars and allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- Funds in **taxable accounts** can incur capital gains taxes when you sell investments at a profit.

### 5. Balance for Flexibility and Growth
- **401(k)**: Use it for long-term growth, especially if employer matching is available.
- **IRA**: Consider using a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Good for additional savings or short-term goals; they offer more flexibility with withdrawals.

### 6. Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance
Your age and risk tolerance should also dictate your allocation. Younger investors may prefer a more aggressive approach, while those nearing retirement may want to balance towards more secure investments.

### Conclusion
To optimize your distribution, consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer match, then maximize your IRA contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA. Lastly, use taxable accounts for additional investments and short-term goals, while being mindful of tax implications.

### Actionable Takeaway
Develop a personalized investment strategy considering your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
