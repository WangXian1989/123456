The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, age, and tax implications. Here's a structured approach to help you determine the best strategy:

### 1. Understand the Accounts

- **401(k)**: An employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching. Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
  
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages for retirement savings. There are two main types:
  - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
  - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free, provided certain conditions are met.

- **Taxable Accounts**: These are regular investment accounts with no tax advantages. Taxes are paid annually on dividends and capital gains.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions

- **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to secure any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

- **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider maximizing your IRA contributions, especially if you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, which provides tax-free growth.

### 3. Evaluate Contribution Limits

- For 2023, the contribution limits are:
  - **401(k)**: $22,500 (with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're 50 or older)
  - **IRA**: $6,500 (plus an additional $1,000 catch-up if you're 50 or older)

### 4. Tax Considerations

- **Tax Diversification**: Aim for a mix of accounts to take advantage of different tax treatments. This strategy can provide flexibility in retirement.

- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Having taxable, tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA), and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts can help manage tax impact during withdrawals.

### 5. Asset Allocation & Growth

- **Investment Strategy**: Your age, risk tolerance, and investment horizon should guide your asset allocation among the accounts. Generally, younger investors can lean toward aggressive growth strategies.

### 6. Review & Adjust Annually

- Stay informed about changes in tax laws, contribution limits, and your personal financial situation. Adjust your allocations and contributions as necessary.

### Conclusion

The best distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is about balancing immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential. Start with employer matches, follow with IRA contributions, and consider your tax implications based on your projected retirement needs.

### Questions to Consider:
1. What are your long-term financial goals, and how do you envision your retirement?
2. Have you reviewed your current contributions and adjusted them to align with your financial goals?
