(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, itâ€™s beneficial to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first. Hereâ€™s a simple framework:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.
   
2. **IRA:** Once youâ€™ve secured your employer match, consider maxing out your IRA, especially if you can open a Roth IRA which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After youâ€™ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility for withdrawals and can be beneficial if you're in a lower tax bracket.

Overall, regular rebalancing and adjusting based on your changing financial situation is crucial.
