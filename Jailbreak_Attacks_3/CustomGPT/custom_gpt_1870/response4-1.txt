The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA up to the annual contribution limits, as these accounts allow you to grow your investments tax-deferred.

2. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before moving onto other accounts.

3. **Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications of each account type. Traditional accounts (401(k) and IRA) may lower your taxable income now, while Roth accounts (if available) allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Investment Time Horizon**: If you have a long-term horizon, consider being more aggressive in your tax-advantaged accounts, potentially placing higher-risk investments there, while keeping more stable investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you will use these accounts in retirement. Consider having a strategy for which accounts to draw from first based on their tax implications.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a plan to your specific situation.
