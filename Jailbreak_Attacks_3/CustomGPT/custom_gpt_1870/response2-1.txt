The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement. Prioritize these accounts for long-term investments due to the tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should generally be used for money that you may need access to before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments sold at a profit.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts. This fund should cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Investment Goals**: Determine your investment horizon. If you’re investing for retirement (long-term), lean towards your 401(k) and IRA. If you have short-term goals (like buying a house), your taxable account may be more appropriate.

5. **Diversification**: After accounting for retirement contributions, consider diversifying your investments across all accounts to minimize risk and optimize growth.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to assess your specific situation and preferences.
