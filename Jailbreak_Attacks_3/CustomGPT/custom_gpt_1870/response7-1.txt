Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s. These accounts offer tax benefits, either through tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Consider Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, consider focusing on traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions to lower your taxable income. If you're in a lower tax bracket, Roth options may be appealing for tax-free growth.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure that your investments are diversified based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. You can hold a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across accounts.

5. **Balance Withdrawals**: As you approach retirement, consider the tax implications of withdrawing from each account. Generally, it may be more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a distribution strategy that fits your unique situation and goals.
