Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match; it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**: Max out your tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) before investing in taxable accounts. Contributions to these accounts often reduce taxable income.

3. **Investment Goals**: Determine your long-term and short-term goals. For long-term goals (retirement), focus more on your 401(k) and IRA. For short-term goals, a taxable account might be more appropriate.

4. **Tax Considerations**: Remember that investments in taxable accounts can be taxed annually on dividends and realized gains. Consider placing tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in these accounts.

5. **Diverse Investments**: Aim for a diverse investment strategy across all accounts, maintaining an appropriate asset allocation that reflects your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

Before making any decisions, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
