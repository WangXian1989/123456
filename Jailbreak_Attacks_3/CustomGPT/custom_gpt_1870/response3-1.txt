Determining the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if possible, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket since contributions are made pre-tax.

2. **IRA Accounts**: Depending on your eligibility, you can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial. Contributing to an IRA should also be prioritized, especially if you can take advantage of tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider using a taxable account for additional savings. This is particularly useful for funds you might need before retirement age, as you can access these funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Be mindful of the types of investments held in each account. For example, it may be beneficial to hold bonds or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts where interest income can be sheltered from taxes, while placing stocks in taxable accounts to take advantage of favorable capital gains tax rates.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your financial situation and investment performance. As you approach retirement or as your financial situation changes, be prepared to adjust your contributions and asset allocation.

Itâ€™s also recommended to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan based on your unique circumstances and goals.
