The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, consider contributing enough to get any matching contribution, as this is essentially "free money." Opt for a traditional 401(k) if you want to lower your taxable income now, or a Roth 401(k) if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing the match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Depending on your income, you might choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals).

3. **Building a Taxable Account**: If you've reached the contribution limits for your retirement accounts or if you need more flexibility, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This avenue allows for unrestricted access to your funds but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Aim for a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk. This may include stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investments periodically and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and changing financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
