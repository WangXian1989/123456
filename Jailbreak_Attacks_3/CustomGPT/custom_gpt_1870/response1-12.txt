Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol and drugs that can harm the liver.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, antiviral medications for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases, or other medications prescribed by a healthcare professional may be recommended.
3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and manage symptoms.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options such as liver transplantation might be considered.
5. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from supplements, but it's crucial to discuss these with a healthcare provider.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific situation.
