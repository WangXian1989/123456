Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute to the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

### 2. **Evaluate Contributions Based on Tax Impact**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing here. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Goals**
   - If you’re saving for retirement, lean towards more aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRAs since they have long horizons.
   - For shorter-term goals, keep funds in taxable accounts more conservative to mitigate risk.

### 4. **Balance Your Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to mitigate risk, adjusting for tax implications according to each account type.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Reassess your strategy periodically based on changes in income, expenses, tax laws, and market conditions.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** 50%
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** 30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20%

### Conclusion
Tailor these percentages based on your unique situation, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
