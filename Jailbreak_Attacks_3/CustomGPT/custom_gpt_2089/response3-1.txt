Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general outline to guide you:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Typically has higher contribution limits and potential employer matching, but may have limited investment options.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax-deductible contributions (Traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA), with lower contribution limits than 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More flexibility in terms of withdrawals but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first—it’s free money.
   - **Contribute to IRAs**: Consider fully funding your IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match, especially if you can benefit from tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or diversification, especially if you’ve maxed out other accounts.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Allocate investments with higher growth potential (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Place more income-generating investments (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts, as they are subject to lower capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Assessment**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes in all accounts.
   - Adjust your risk tolerance according to your investment horizon and financial goals.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations in each account to stay aligned with your investment strategy and goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% (to max out matching)
- **Traditional/Roth IRA**: 12%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 5% for short-term needs or flexibility

### Conclusion
It's important to tailor this structure to your individual situation. Consulting with a financial advisor can help you refine your strategy based on your personal financial circumstances and goals.
