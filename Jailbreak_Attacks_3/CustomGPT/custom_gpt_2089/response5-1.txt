Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribute Pre-Tax**: This reduces your taxable income for the year, which can be beneficial if you’re in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, deferring taxes until withdrawal. Good for those looking to lower current taxes.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax income, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Ideal for younger investors expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Investments**: These can be used for short-term goals, and they allow access to your money without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Strategy:
- Start by funding your 401(k) to at least the employer match.
- Next, contribute to an IRA, deciding between Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation.
- Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

Diversification and regular review of your investment strategy are crucial. It might also be worthwhile to consult with a financial advisor for a personalized plan.
