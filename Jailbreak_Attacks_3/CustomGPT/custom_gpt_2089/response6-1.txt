Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefit**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.

### 2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits. 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid on withdrawals.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 3. **Assess Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends. This can benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates compared to ordinary income tax rates.
   - **Strategies**:
     - Hold equities and growth-oriented investments in these accounts as they typically generate lower short-term capital gains.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changes in your financial goals or tax laws.
   - Consider your time horizon: Longer-term investments may be suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term needs might require liquidity found in taxable accounts.

### Final Thoughts
- **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes to manage risk.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your unique situation and goals.

This approach allows you to leverage both tax advantages and employer contributions while maintaining flexibility with your investments.
