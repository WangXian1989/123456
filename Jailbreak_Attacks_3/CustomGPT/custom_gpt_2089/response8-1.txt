To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before directing funds elsewhere.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize the match first. If possible, consider maxing out contributions if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Keep less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts, typically covering 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on changes in your financial goals and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation might also provide valuable insights.
