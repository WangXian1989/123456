Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for savings beyond retirement accounts, especially if you want to invest for goals in the near term.

### 2. **Understanding Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth). Withdrawals in retirement are taxed (traditional) or tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings (interest, dividends, and capital gains) are subject to taxes in the year they are realized.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Given their tax advantages, this is often best for long-term investments and may include a mix of stocks, bonds, and funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or long-term held stocks to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before investing heavily in any of these accounts.

### 5. **Regular Review:**
   - Reassess your allocations regularly based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach often leads to the best outcome, considering both growth potential and tax efficiency. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific circumstances.
