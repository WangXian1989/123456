Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Retirement Needs:** Determine how much you'll need in retirement and plan accordingly.
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Understand your risk tolerance to allocate assets effectively.

### 2. **Contribute to Employer-Sponsored Plans**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** Contribute enough to get any employer match (usually a good "free money" strategy).
   - **Consider the Plan's Fees:** Check the fees associated with your 401(k) and the investment options available.

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA:**
     - **Traditional IRA:** Tax-deductible contributions may reduce taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - Evaluate based on your current versus expected future tax rates.

### 4. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and access. 
   - Prioritize tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize taxable gains.

### 5. **Rebalancing and Adjusting**
   - **Regular Review:** Periodically reassess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.
   - **Market Conditions:** Adjust your allocations based on changes in market conditions or personal circumstances.

### 6. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** 15-20% of income, focusing on maxing out contributions for employer match.
- **IRA:** Contribute up to the current limit (e.g., $6,500 for individuals, $7,500 for those 50+).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate remaining funds here, perhaps 10-30%, focusing on long-term growth investments.

### Conclusion
The ideal balance varies by individual circumstances, but prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts before taxable accounts generally maximizes benefits. Adjust as needed based on changing financial goals and tax implications.
