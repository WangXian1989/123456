Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) after maximizing the 401(k) match. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit, especially if your employer offers a good investment option.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. This allows flexibility in withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Investment Mix**: Diversify your portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider putting more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. For example, investments that generate high levels of income might be better in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your salary (to get the full employer match)
- **IRA**: Max contributions (up to the annual limit)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts
