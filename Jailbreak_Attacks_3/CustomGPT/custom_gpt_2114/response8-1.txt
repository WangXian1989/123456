To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Focus on maxing out contributions if you have a high income or good investment options.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your income level and tax situation, prioritize contributing to an IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth; Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower taxes (e.g., long-term capital gains or qualified dividends). This is also where you'll want to keep more liquid funds for short-term needs.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Ensure that your investment portfolio across all accounts reflects your risk tolerance and investment goals. Diversifying helps mitigate risk.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly:** 
   - Rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation and respond to any changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

6. **Consider Future Tax Bracket:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth accounts. If you believe your tax rate will decrease, traditional accounts might be more beneficial.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your unique financial circumstances.
