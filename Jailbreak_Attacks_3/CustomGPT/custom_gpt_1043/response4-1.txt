To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Max out any employer match first as it's essentially free money.
   - Aim to contribute enough to reach the annual limit, which is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50) for 2024. 

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The limits for 2024 are $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).
   - Choose a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you're eligible, or a traditional IRA for tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for flexible access to funds. After funding tax-advantaged accounts, invest in a taxable account for additional savings or for specific goals.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diverse asset allocation across all accounts. Balance between stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of the tax treatment for each account type. Distribute assets in a way to optimize tax efficiency and mitigate potential tax liabilities.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and life events.
