To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit, particularly if you have a high tax rate since contributions are made pre-tax.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower expected returns or those you may need to access before retirement, as these assets can be more easily liquidated without penalties.

4. **Investment Type Consideration**:
   - Place high-growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - Hold income-generating investments (bonds, dividends) in taxable accounts to utilize lower tax rates on qualified dividends and capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified across asset classes to mitigate risks.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically assess your allocation to maintain your desired risk profile and investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Professional advice can tailor a strategy based on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By following these guidelines, you'll create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy tailored to your financial goals.
