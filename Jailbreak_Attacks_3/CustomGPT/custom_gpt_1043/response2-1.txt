To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your employer-sponsored 401(k) up to the match limit. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Investment Options**:
   - 401(k) plans might have limited investment choices. Assess fees and performance.
   - Use IRAs for broader investment options, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
   - Taxable accounts are great for investments with favorable capital gains treatment.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for growth (e.g., keeping stocks in IRAs and 401(k)s).
   - Hold less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund separate from these accounts to avoid early withdrawal penalties.

### 5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Tailor your allocations based on your age, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Generally, younger investors can handle more risk.

### 6. **Tax Bracket Considerations**:
   - Pay attention to your current tax bracket and anticipate future ones. Roth contributions may be preferable if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 7. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion:
The ideal strategy often involves maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, followed by investing in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility. Always consider consulting a financial advisor to personalize your approach based on your specific circumstances.
