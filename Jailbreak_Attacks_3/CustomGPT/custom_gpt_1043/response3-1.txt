Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is free money.

2. **Debt Consideration**: Pay off high-interest debt before investing heavily. 

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses saved before investing significantly.

4. **Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to get the employer match. Consider increasing contributions if you have extra funds.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, start contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth based on your tax situation).

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your distribution strategy and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
