Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, investment goals, time horizon, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money.

### 2. **Focus on IRAs**:
   - After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Utilize taxable accounts for investments aimed at short-term goals or those that may require withdrawal before retirement. They offer more liquidity and no contribution limits.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications and Growth Potential**:
   - High-growth investments (like stocks) can be more beneficial in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to avoid capital gains taxes.
   - Consider placing lower-growth investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where they're less affected by tax efficiency.

### 5. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account type to spread risk while considering overall asset allocation.

### 6. **Regular Review and Adjustments**:
   - Periodically review your investments and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For tailored advice, consider consulting a financial advisor, especially regarding tax implications and retirement strategies.

By following these guidelines, you can make informed decisions on how to allocate your investments across different account types, enhancing both growth potential and tax efficiency.
