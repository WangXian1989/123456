To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (either Roth or traditional). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in a taxable brokerage account. This is useful for flexibility and immediate access to funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, maintain a diverse asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Typically, riskier assets like stocks might be better suited for long-term growth in retirement accounts, while more stable assets might be placed in taxable accounts.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts. Prioritize holding onto investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your strategy as you approach retirement or if your financial situation changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor your approach to your specific situation.
