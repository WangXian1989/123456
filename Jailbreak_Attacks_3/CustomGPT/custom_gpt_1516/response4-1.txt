Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
   - Max out your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth depending on your eligibility).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRAs can defer taxes until withdrawal, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, advantageous if you expect higher future income.

3. **Balance Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep enough funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs, as they provide easier access without penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, ensure a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Monitor performance and reallocate as necessary based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
