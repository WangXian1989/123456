Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA (traditional or Roth) next. This provides tax advantages and can enhance your retirement savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you've maxed contributions to your retirement accounts. This gives you more liquidity and flexibility.

4. **Consider Taxes**: Keep in mind the tax implications for each account:
   - *401(k) and Traditional IRA*: Contributions are pre-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - *Roth IRA*: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - *Taxable Accounts*: You'll pay capital gains tax on any profits.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your age and risk tolerance. Younger individuals might focus on growth stocks, while those closer to retirement might prioritize safer investments.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocations and modulate them based on changes in income, tax laws, or personal goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
