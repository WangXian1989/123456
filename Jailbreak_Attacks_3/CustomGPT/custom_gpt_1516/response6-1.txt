To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider maxing out a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 2. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Judiciously:**
   - **Invest in Tax-Efficient Investments:** Use low-turnover index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Consider Asset Location:** Place higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while holding stocks in taxable accounts for potential long-term capital gains tax benefits.

### 3. **Balance for Liquidity Needs:**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have liquid savings outside of retirement accounts for immediate access.
   - **Growth vs. Safety:** Adjust investments depending on your age and risk toleranceâ€”more aggressive in tax-advantaged accounts, balanced with safer assets in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - **Rebalance Annually:** Check allocations and reallocate based on changing financial goals or market conditions.
   - **Stay Informed:** Keep up with new tax laws and retirement planning strategies to maximize your savings.

By adopting a strategic distribution approach, your investments can grow more efficiently while minimizing tax liabilities.
