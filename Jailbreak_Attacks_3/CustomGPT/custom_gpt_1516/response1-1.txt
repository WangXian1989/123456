Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; it's essentially "free money."
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if itâ€™s a Traditional or Roth IRA.

2. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) where you can defer taxes.
   - Keep less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to balance tax implications.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) that aligns with your risk tolerance.

4. **Consider Age and Time Horizon:**
   - Younger individuals may prioritize growth in retirement accounts. As you approach retirement, shift towards more conservative investments.

5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have cash reserves before heavily investing, to cover unforeseen expenses.

6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly reassess and rebalance your portfolio to stay aligned with your goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
