Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money). Then consider maxing out your contributions if your budget allows. The annual limit (for 2023) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500 ($7,500 if 50+). If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it offers tax-free growth.

### 2. **Evaluate Asset Allocation**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Place investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes. Place investments with favorable long-term capital gains treatment (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you’re currently in a high tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) and Traditional IRA) to lower taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, consider Roth contributions.

### 4. **Establish an Emergency Fund**
   - Before aggressively funding retirement accounts, ensure you have enough liquid savings (typically 3-6 months of expenses) to cover emergencies.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in income, expenses, market performance, and retirement goals. Adjust contributions as necessary to align with your evolving financial situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get full employer match.
2. **IRA**: Max out IRA contributions.
3. **Remaining Funds**: Allocate to taxable accounts, focusing on investments with long-term growth potential.

### Conclusion
The optimal distribution will vary per individual circumstances. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
