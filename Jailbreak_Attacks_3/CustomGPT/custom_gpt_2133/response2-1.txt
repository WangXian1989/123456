The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. 
   - For 2023, the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

### 3. **Contribute Beyond the Match in 401(k)**
   - After maximizing the employer match and IRA contributions, increase your contributions to the 401(k) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - The 401(k) contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you’ve maxed out retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts to maintain liquidity and flexibility.
   - This can include index funds or ETFs that are more tax-efficient.

### 5. **Consider Asset Location**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like municipal bonds or index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Reassess Annually**
   - Regularly review your allocation based on changing financial goals, tax laws, and market conditions.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.

By following this structured approach, you can effectively and efficiently manage your investments across different account types.
