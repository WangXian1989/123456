Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you can, aim to max out your contribution.
   - **IRA:** After contributing to your 401(k), consider funding a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation and whether you prefer tax-free growth or deferred taxes.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate income (like bonds) or for assets you anticipate selling in the near term to avoid high capital gains taxes in the future.
   - **Asset Location:** Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and dividends or interest-generating assets in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - Ensure an appropriate mix of equities, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to diversify risk.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement, considering which accounts to tap first to minimize taxes.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for growth and tax efficiency.
