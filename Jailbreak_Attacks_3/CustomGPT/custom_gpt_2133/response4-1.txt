To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and retirement goals. Prioritize this if you have maxed out your 401(k) contributions.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA:** Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free. Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. Holding investments for over a year may reduce this rate.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k)/IRA:** Focus on long-term growth through a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. These accounts are generally for retirement, so a more aggressive investment strategy can be appropriate.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxable events.

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside these accounts for liquidity. This might influence how much you allocate to taxable versus retirement accounts.

5. **Review Periodically:**
   - Regularly reassess your contributions and allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions. Adjust your strategy as needed.
