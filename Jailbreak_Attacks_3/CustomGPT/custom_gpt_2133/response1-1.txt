Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key points to consider:

### 1. **Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are typically pre-tax (for traditional accounts), which can reduce your taxable income. Earnings grow tax-deferred.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment income and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized.

### 2. **Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k):** For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you're age 50+).
   - **IRA:** The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50+).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No limits on contributions, but you’ll pay taxes on gains.

### 3. **Investment Goals:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for retirement savings.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments.
   - **Diversification:** Ensure you have a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - **Early Withdrawals:** Avoid withdrawing from retirement accounts before age 59½ to minimize penalties.
   - **Tax Planning:** Consider your tax bracket when choosing which account to withdraw from in retirement.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your investments and adjust your allocations as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### 6. **Consult a Professional:**
   - Consider talking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.

### Sample Distribution Approach:
- **Max Out Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first.
- **Contribute to IRA:** Consider putting funds into a Roth IRA if eligible, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
- **Use Taxable Accounts for Surplus:** Invest any additional funds in taxable accounts for flexibility.

This strategy helps balance growth potential while minimizing taxes according to your unique situation.
