Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth is especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. These can provide flexibility and liquidity without penalties for early withdrawals like retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Typically, you might hold more aggressive investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for potential tax-free growth, while reserving more stable investments (bonds) for taxable accounts to manage capital gains tax.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, you'll want to draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-advantaged accounts, to maximize tax efficiency.

It’s a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your individual situation!
