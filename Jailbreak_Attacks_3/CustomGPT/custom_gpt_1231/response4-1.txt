Distributing your money efficiently among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), always contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this match. Itâ€™s essentially free money!

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to 401(k) with pre-tax contributions and taxed withdrawals. Consider using this account for long-term growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: Offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made after-tax. This is ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold. This account is suitable for more liquid and flexible investment needs.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, stocks are allocated in growth-oriented accounts (like Roth IRAs) for tax-free growth, while more stable investments like bonds may be better in taxable accounts where interest income is taxed annually.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, consider your withdrawal strategies. Withdraw from tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRAs) first to give your tax-advantaged accounts more time to grow.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, for example, the limits are $23,000 for 401(k) contributions ($30,000 if age 50 or older), $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if age 50 or older), and unlimited for taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on performance, changing goals, and life circumstances.
