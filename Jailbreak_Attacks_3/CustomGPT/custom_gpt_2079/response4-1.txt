Distributing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, consider contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money. Additionally, contribute to an IRA, especially if you qualify for a tax deduction.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Understand how different accounts are taxed. Withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes when investments are sold for a profit.

3. **Balance Investment Choices**: Different accounts may have different investment options. For instance, consider holding assets that are more likely to generate taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while potentially placing investments with lower expected turnover (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Adjust Based on Financial Goals**: If you plan to retire early or need access to funds before retirement age, ensure that your asset allocation takes liquidity into account. You may want more money in taxable accounts for easier access.

5. **Regularly Reassess Your Allocation**: As your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws change, regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy to ensure it remains aligned with your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities involved in investment strategies, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial planner who can provide personalized advice based on your circumstances.

It is crucial to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and objectives.
