I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general suggestions that may be relevant for liver health. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Common treatment options for liver problems might include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some severe cases, surgery. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet low in saturated fats and sugars while incorporating fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can support liver health. Regular physical activity and maintaining a healthy weight are also crucial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes. For example, antiviral medications may be used for viral hepatitis.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption can significantly benefit liver function, especially for those with alcohol-related liver disease.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track the progression of liver disease and the effectiveness of treatment.

5. **Surgery**: In rare cases, surgical interventions such as liver transplantation may be considered if liver function severely declines.

Always seek professional advice to determine the best options for your specific situation.
