When considering how to distribute your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors should guide your decisions:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: Take advantage of the tax benefits offered by retirement accounts. For example, traditional 401(k)s and IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth, meaning you won't pay taxes on gains until you withdraw the money in retirement. Conversely, investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes when sold. Generally, investing income-generating assets, such as bonds or dividend-paying stocks, in tax-deferred accounts can be more tax-efficient.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the contribution limits for each account type. As of 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 ($30,000 for those age 50 and older), while IRA contributions are limited to $6,500 ($7,500 for those age 50 and older). If you can maximize your contributions to these tax-advantaged accounts, it often makes sense to do so before investing significantly in taxable accounts.

3. **Investment Options**: Analyze the investment options available in your 401(k) plan. Some plans may have limited investment choices, whereas IRAs and taxable accounts typically offer a wider range of investment options. If your 401(k) lacks diverse investment choices, you may want to contribute less to it compared to your IRA or taxable accounts.

4. **Time Horizon and Goals**: Assess your financial goals and time horizon for each investment. Long-term goals, such as retirement, may benefit from a heavier allocation towards the retirement accounts, while shorter-term goals might necessitate greater liquidity found in taxable accounts.

5. **Risk Tolerance**: Your risk tolerance may also dictate your distribution strategy. If you are more risk-averse, you may prefer to allocate more funds to conservative investments in your tax-advantaged accounts, while utilizing taxable accounts for higher-risk, higher-return investments.

6. **Age and Retirement Plans**: Your age can significantly influence your strategy. Younger individuals may opt for more aggressive investing to leverage compound growth, while those closer to retirement may choose to preserve capital and prepare for withdrawal.

In sum, it is often advisable to prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (to the limit), focusing on tax-efficient investments in retirement accounts while reserving taxable accounts for more flexible, short-term investments. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice is also highly recommended, as they can provide tailored guidance based on your specific financial situation.
