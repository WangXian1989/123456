When considering the optimal allocation of funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account several factors including tax implications, investment goals, and your time horizon. Here are key points to consider:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: Generally, it's advisable to place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) where you wonâ€™t be taxed on capital gains annually, and keep more stable income-generating investments in taxable accounts where you can take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals, prioritize maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) Employer Match, IRA contributions).
   - For short-term goals, consider using taxable accounts to maintain liquidity and access to your funds without penalties.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your asset allocation across accounts maintains a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance. This might involve keeping some bonds or conservative investments in your taxable account to create balance.

4. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. Maxing out employer matches in a 401(k) and then contributing to an IRA can maximize your tax-advantaged savings.

It's prudent to consult with a financial advisor tailored to your unique financial situation to ensure appropriate allocations that align with current tax laws and your overall investment strategy.
