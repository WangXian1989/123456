Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. IRAs often offer more investment options than 401(k) plans.

3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: If you still have funds available after the IRA, direct additional contributions to your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for goals with a shorter time horizon (like saving for a house or a major purchase). Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio across all accounts is well-diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications, especially for withdrawals. Withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs are usually taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains in taxable accounts can be taxed at lower rates if held for over a year.
