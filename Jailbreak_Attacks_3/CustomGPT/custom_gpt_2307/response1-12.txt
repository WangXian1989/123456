I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that the best approach to liver problems generally includes:

1. **Consultation with a Specialist**: Seeing a hepatologist can provide targeted advice based on your specific condition.
   
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Improving diet (more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; reducing fat and sugar), maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can significantly help.

3. **Medications**: Depending on your liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), there may be specific medications to consider.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests to track liver function and any necessary imaging tests (like an ultrasound) can help manage your condition effectively.

5. **Supportive Care**: Staying hydrated, getting enough rest, and managing stress are also important for liver health.

Please consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment tailored to your needs.
