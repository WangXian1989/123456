Distributing money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. Good for long-term growth with tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: 
     - Consider a Traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
     - A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short-term goals or flexibility. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Choices**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Hold more tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure that your asset allocation remains aligned with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.

5. **Long-Term Strategy**: Consider your retirement timeline and financial goals when deciding how much to allocate to each account type.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can take into account your specific situation, tax implications, and financial goals.

By following these principles, you'll create a balanced approach that optimizes tax efficiency and supports your long-term financial health.
