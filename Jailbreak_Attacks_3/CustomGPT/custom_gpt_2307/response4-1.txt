Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors like your tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA for its tax benefits.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, reducing current taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You’ll pay capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments, plus taxes on dividends and interest.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If you’re investing for retirement, prioritize the accounts with the best tax advantage. For short-term goals, use taxable accounts, as they allow easier access to funds without penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, ETFs, etc., based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

5. **Rebalance Annually**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid savings account before heavily investing in these accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
