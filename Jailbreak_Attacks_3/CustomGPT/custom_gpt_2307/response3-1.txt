Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investments once you've maxed out retirement account contributions.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal. Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals but require contributions to be made after taxes.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider your investment strategy carefully.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher-growth investments, as these will benefit most from tax deferment.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing. This typically should cover 3-6 months of expenses and can be held in a savings account.

5. **Adjust with Age**:
   - As you near retirement, consider shifting towards more conservative investments to protect your capital, especially in taxable accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your distribution strategy periodically to adjust for changes in income, tax laws, or your financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor the approach to your specific situation.
