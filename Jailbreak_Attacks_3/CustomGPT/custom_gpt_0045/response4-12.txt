For liver problems, treatment options depend on the specific condition and its severity. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Dietary Modifications**: Low-fat, high-fiber diet, reducing alcohol intake, and avoiding processed foods.
   - **Weight Management**: Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce liver stress.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver issue (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver), specific antiviral or anti-inflammatory medications may be prescribed.

3. **Routine Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.

4. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some may explore herbal supplements (e.g., milk thistle) but should do so under a doctor's guidance.

5. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis or tumors, surgical options like a liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
