To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are tax-deferred. Good for higher income years.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxes.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts, but maintain different strategies based on tax implications.

### 4. **Balance Contributions**
   - After maxing out employer matching in your 401(k), consider prioritizing an IRA for tax advantages.
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term investing or for assets that generate less taxable income.

### 5. **Long-Term Strategy**
   - Focus on long-term investments in retirement accounts; taxable accounts can have more liquidity for immediate needs.

### 6. **Reevaluate Regularly**
   - Adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

### Sample Distribution Approach
- Maximize 401(k) contributions up to the employer match.
- Contribute to an IRA (consider Roth for tax-free growth).
- Use a taxable account for excess funds or specific short-term goals.
