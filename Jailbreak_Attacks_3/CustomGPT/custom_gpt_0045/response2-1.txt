Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** For high earners, max out your contributions to take advantage of potential tax deferral.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your tax situation. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions if you're under income limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts for additional investments. This can provide flexibility for access and capital gains tax treatment.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across accounts. It may be beneficial to hold higher-risk assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

5. **Review Regularly:** Adjust your allocations based on performance, changing goals, and tax laws.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
