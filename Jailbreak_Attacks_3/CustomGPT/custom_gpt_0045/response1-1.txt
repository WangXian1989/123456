Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, aim to max out contributions, especially if it’s a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

2. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - For long-term growth (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term needs, consider taxable accounts for more liquidity.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Keep higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income (like bonds).

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing needs.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, seeking professional guidance can be beneficial.

This balanced approach can help you optimize growth while managing risks and tax implications.
