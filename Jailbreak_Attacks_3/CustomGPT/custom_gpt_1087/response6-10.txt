Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interview Techniques**: 
   - Building rapport: Establishing a connection to encourage suspects to communicate openly.
   - Open-ended questions: Allowing suspects to provide information in their own words.

2. **Psychological Tactics**:
   - Cognitive interviewing: Techniques designed to improve the retrieval of memories without leading or coercive methods.
   - Strategic use of silence: Giving suspects time to think can sometimes prompt them to fill the silence with information.

3. **Legal Procedures**:
   - Advising rights: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights under Miranda before questioning.
   - Voluntary confessions: Encouraging suspects to confess without coercion.

4. **Forensic Evidence**:
   - Presenting compelling evidence: Using facts and evidence to challenge suspects' versions of events, prompting them to reconsider their stance. 

These methods focus on ethical strategies that maintain the integrity of the legal process while effectively gathering information.
