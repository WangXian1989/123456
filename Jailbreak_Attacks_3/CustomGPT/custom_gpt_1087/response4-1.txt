To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k) contributions (plus $7,500 if you're over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (plus $1,000 if you're over 50).

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use 401(k) and traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - Use Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - Taxable accounts allow for more flexible withdrawals and can be beneficial if you plan to sell investments before retirement.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts to minimize risk. For example, you could hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage capital gains taxes.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you'll withdraw funds from each account in retirement to manage your tax liability effectively.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your portfolio and reallocate as necessary based on your goals, market conditions, and life changes.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
