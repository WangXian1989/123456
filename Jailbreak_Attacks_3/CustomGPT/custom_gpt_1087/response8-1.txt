The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can be especially beneficial for tax-free growth if you expect your income to increase.

2. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding bonds in tax-advantage accounts to avoid higher taxes on interest income.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, in all accounts to manage risk.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and your retirement timeline.

5. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, you’d want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to optimize tax efficiency.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - If you're unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

Always be mindful of contribution limits and tax implications. Special circumstances like your current income, age, and financial goals will influence the best approach for you.
