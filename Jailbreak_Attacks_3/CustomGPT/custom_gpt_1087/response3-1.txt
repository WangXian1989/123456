To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Tax Advantage Priority**:
   - **Max Out 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, fund your IRA (traditional or Roth) after your 401(k) contributions.

2. **Taxation Consideration**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed on capital gains and dividends. They provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term investments like stocks for growth. Consider a mix based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for more liquid investments. It's also a good place for tax-efficient funds or individual stocks to benefit from capital gains.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all account types, balancing risk while aiming for growth.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

6. **Consider Future Tax Implications**:
   - Think about your expected tax bracket in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher bracket, maximizing Roth contributions could be beneficial.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Individual circumstances vary widely, so consider getting professional advice tailored to your situation.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment strategy and work towards your financial goals.
