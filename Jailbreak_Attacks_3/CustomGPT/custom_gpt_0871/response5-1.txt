(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):** Maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if they offer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money. If you can, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.

2. **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for any additional investments once you have maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions. Taxable accounts can offer more flexibility and liquidity but are subject to capital gains taxes.

It's essential to regularly review and adjust your investments based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax implications.
