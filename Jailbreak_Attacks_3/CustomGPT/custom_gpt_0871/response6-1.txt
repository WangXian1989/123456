Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline for using the funds. Here are some considerations to help with allocation:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions within the annual limit.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Funds in a taxable account are subject to capital gains tax, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Consider placing investments that may contribute to higher income in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are expected to generate capital gains that can be offset by any losses or for assets with lower tax implications, such as index funds or ETFs.

3. **Diversification Strategy:**
   - Diversify your portfolio across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to spread risk. Use tax-advantaged accounts for assets that generate significant taxable income (like bonds).
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like individual stocks) in taxable accounts where you can manage capital gains taxes actively.

### Recommended Steps
- Assess your current tax situation and calculate your effective tax rate.
- Decide on a contribution strategy that maximizes tax advantages while ensuring liquidity needs are met with your taxable accounts.
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with changing financial goals or market conditions.

This approach can help optimize your financial strategies based on investment growth potential and tax efficiency.
