When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money. Focus on tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a traditional IRA provides tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you may need to access sooner, focusing on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

Consider your financial goals, time horizon, and tax implications when choosing the right mix. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
