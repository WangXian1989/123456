I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems that you might consider:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or address underlying issues.

3. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options may be necessary, including liver transplantation for end-stage liver disease.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help track liver function and detect any changes early.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
