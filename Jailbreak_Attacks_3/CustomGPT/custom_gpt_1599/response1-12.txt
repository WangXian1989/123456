I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for liver issues. Treatment options often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopt a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and avoid alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, certain medications can help manage symptoms and slow progression.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Limit exposure to substances harmful to the liver.

Always seek personalized advice from a healthcare provider.
