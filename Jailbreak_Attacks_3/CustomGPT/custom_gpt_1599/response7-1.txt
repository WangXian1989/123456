To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out contributions to your IRA and 401(k) before allocating funds to taxable accounts. IRAs and 401(k) plans provide tax benefits that can enhance your long-term savings.

3. **Consider Investment Options**: Choose investments in tax-advantaged accounts that are expected to generate higher returns, such as stocks. Use your taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, municipal bonds).

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, your asset allocation may drift due to varying returns. Regularly reassess and rebalance your accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking professional advice to tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

This diversified approach can help you maximize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
