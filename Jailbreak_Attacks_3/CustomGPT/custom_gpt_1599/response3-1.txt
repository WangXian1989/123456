Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a strategy to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: Maximize your 401(k) contributions to get any employer matching contributions first.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). This can provide tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you'll need sooner or for flexibility. Prioritize tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxes on gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider risk toleranceâ€”stocks for growth in retirement accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of withdrawal strategies in retirement to minimize taxes.
