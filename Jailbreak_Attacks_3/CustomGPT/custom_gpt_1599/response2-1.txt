To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize maxing out contributions to your IRA (especially if it's a Roth) and 401(k). 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you may need access to before retirement or for goals in the near future. 

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, focusing on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice is also recommended.
