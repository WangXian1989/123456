Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guide to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Matching Contributions**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer matching.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), so consider your current vs. future tax rates.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your expected tax situation in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits and ensure you’re not missing out on these opportunities.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts can provide liquidity and flexibility for investment options without tax penalties for withdrawals.
   - **Investing Strategy**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Approach:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with your 401(k) up to the match, then fund your IRA.
- **Balance and Diversify**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Diversify investments to manage risk.
- **Revisit Regularly**: Review and adjust your distribution strategy annually or as your financial situation changes.

It's also wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
