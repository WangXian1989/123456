The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations to guide your distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional) or grow tax-free (Roth). If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can be a beneficial way to provide tax-free income in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for investments. These accounts don’t have contribution limits and provide flexibility for withdrawals. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes on any gains when you sell investments.

4. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across all three account types, adjusting based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. A mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets may help balance risk and reward.

5. **Withdrawals and Timing**: Plan for your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Certain accounts have penalties for early withdrawal or required minimum distributions (RMDs), which can affect your tax situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to work with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy to your unique financial circumstances.

By carefully considering these factors, you can develop a balanced approach that aligns with your financial goals.
