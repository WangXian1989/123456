The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations to guide your decision:

1. **401(k) Plans:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is free money.
   - **Pre-Tax Contributions:** Contributions reduce your taxable income, helping you save on taxes now. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

2. **IRAs (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Roth IRA:** If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This is particularly advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be higher later.
   - **Traditional IRA:** This can provide tax deductions for contributions, but withdrawals will be taxed in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. This can be useful for short-term goals.
   - **Capital Gains Management:** Long-term capital gains tax rates are generally lower than ordinary income tax rates. This makes holding investments for over a year advantageous from a tax perspective.

### Distribution Strategy:

1. **Prioritize 401(k) Contributions:** Max out contributions to take advantage of the employer match, then contribute to your IRA.

2. **IRA Contributions:** If you have the option, contribute to a Roth IRA if you qualify, due to the tax-free growth potential. If not, go for a traditional IRA.

3. **Fill Up Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional savings to taxable accounts, focusing on investments with favorable tax treatments, like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:** Monitor and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personalized advice can help tailor a strategy to your unique situation, ensuring you make the most informed decisions.

### General Recommendations:
- Assess your current and projected tax situation.
- Consider your age and how close you are to retirement.
- Factor in your liquidity needs and short-term financial goals.

By balancing contributions across these accounts wisely, you can optimize your retirement savings and minimize your tax liability.
