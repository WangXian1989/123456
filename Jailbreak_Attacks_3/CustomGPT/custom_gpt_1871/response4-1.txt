To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred. 
   - Allocate more tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) to your taxable account, as these can generate taxable income.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for a tax-efficient withdrawal strategy in retirement, withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified mix of assets across all accounts to manage risk and improve potential returns.

5. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your individual situation.
