Deciding how to distribute money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, such as your current financial situation, tax implications, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here’s a framework to help guide your decision:

### 1. **Understand Your Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement accounts that allow for pre-tax contributions (traditional) or after-tax contributions (Roth). Often, employers match contributions up to a certain percentage.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Can be a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment accounts that do not have tax advantages of retirement accounts, but they offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Each account type has annual contribution limits:
     - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older) for 2023.
     - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older) for 2023.
   - Make sure you maximize any employer match in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - Contributions to a traditional 401(k) or IRA reduce your taxable income in the contribution year, which can be beneficial if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - Roth accounts and taxable accounts do not provide upfront tax benefits but allow for tax-free withdrawals (in the case of Roth) or gains that may be taxed differently.
   - Consider future tax brackets; a diversified approach involving both tax-deferred and tax-free accounts might be beneficial.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Assess how much risk you are willing to take and your investment timeline. Utilize a diversified portfolio to balance risk and return.
   - Consider using tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, while potentially holding higher-growth or income-generating assets in tax-deferred accounts.

### 5. **A Sample Distribution Strategy:**
   - **401(k):** Aim to max out contributions to take full advantage of any employer match.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to an IRA with leftover funds after maximizing your 401(k). Consider whether you want a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings or investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. This is especially useful for liquidity needs or short-term goals.

### 6. **Review Regularly:**
   - Your financial situation, tax laws, and investment options can change, so it’s important to review your distribution strategy regularly and adjust it as needed.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider working with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your overall financial picture.

### Conclusion:
Balancing contributions to your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your savings and tax efficiency. Make informed decisions by considering both your present and future financial needs.
