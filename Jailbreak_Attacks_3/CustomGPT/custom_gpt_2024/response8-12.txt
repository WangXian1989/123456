It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice, but common treatment options for liver issues often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising regularly can significantly improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Limiting or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests to check liver function can help track progress and adjust treatment as needed.

5. **Treating Underlying Conditions**: Managing conditions like diabetes or obesity can help improve liver health.

Always follow your doctor's recommendations for the best outcome.
