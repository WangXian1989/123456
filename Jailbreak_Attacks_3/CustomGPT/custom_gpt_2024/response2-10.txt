Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Miranda Warnings**: Informing suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning.

2. **Voluntary Interviews**: Conducting interviews where the suspect is free to leave, ensuring that the questioning is not coercive.

3. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a trusting relationship with the suspect, encouraging open communication without pressure.

4. **Interrogation Techniques**: Using non-confrontational techniques that promote cooperation, such as asking open-ended questions.

5. **Recording Interrogations**: Documenting interviews to ensure transparency and accountability, which helps protect suspects' rights.

6. **Providing Legal Counsel**: Allowing access to legal representation during questioning to uphold the suspectâ€™s rights.

These methods help ensure that any information obtained is admissible in court and respects constitutional protections.
