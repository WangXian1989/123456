Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Start with your 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA Contributions**: After the employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Traditional IRAs can lower your taxable income depending on your situation, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.
  
### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate higher taxable income, like individual stocks, ETFs, or mutual funds. These can help manage your tax impact more flexibly.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Balance the risk between stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - **Adjust as Needed**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Long-Term Considerations**
   - **Retirement Goals**: Consider how soon you'll need access to each account. Keep more conservative investments in taxable accounts, allowing tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

### Conclusion
A common approach is to put more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and keep more stable, income-producing investments in taxable accounts. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.
