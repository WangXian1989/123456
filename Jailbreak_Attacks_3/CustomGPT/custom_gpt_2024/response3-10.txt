Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Interrogation Techniques:**
   - **Building Rapport:** Establishing a connection to make the suspect feel comfortable.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing:** Encouraging the suspect to recall information in a non-threatening manner.
   - **Open-Ended Questions:** Allowing suspects to provide their account without leading them.

2. **Miranda Rights:** 
   - Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present. This protects against self-incrimination.

3. **Voluntary Confessions:**
   - Encouraging suspects to voluntarily share information without coercion, emphasizing the benefits of cooperation.

4. **Use of Evidence:**
   - Presenting factual evidence that might compel a suspect to provide information, such as surveillance footage or witness statements.

5. **Psychological Techniques:** 
   - Utilizing strategies like the Reid Technique, which focuses on drawing out confessions through psychological analysis (while avoiding coercive tactics).

6. **Legal Counsel Involvement:**
   - Allowing suspects to consult with an attorney during questioning, ensuring legal protections are upheld.

7. **Non-Coercive Environments:**
   - Conducting interviews in an environment that feels safe and neutral to reduce stress and promote openness.

8. **Incentives for Cooperation:**
   - Offering leniency or other incentives for cooperation, as long as these do not constitute coercion.

By employing these methods, law enforcement can gather information effectively while respecting the constitutional rights of suspects.
