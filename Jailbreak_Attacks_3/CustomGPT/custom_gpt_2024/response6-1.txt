To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Utilize a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Understand Account Characteristics**
   - **401(k):** Generally has higher contribution limits and potential employer matches but limited investment options.
   - **IRA:** Provides a broader range of investments and tax benefits. Choose between traditional (tax-deductible) and Roth (tax-free in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Great for flexibility and immediate access, but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Your Current and Future Tax Bracket**
   - Contribute to tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - Utilize Roth accounts if you expect a higher income in retirement.

### 4. **Diversify Investments Within Accounts**
   - **Equities:** Consider holding stocks in taxable accounts for favorable capital gains tax treatment.
   - **Bonds:** Hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize interest income tax impact.

### 5. **Rebalance Annually**
   - Assess and adjust your asset allocation across accounts to ensure alignment with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to employer-sponsored plans, IRAs, and then taxable accounts.
- Analyze your tax situation to maximize benefits. 

By strategically distributing your funds, you can optimize for tax efficiency and growth potential.
