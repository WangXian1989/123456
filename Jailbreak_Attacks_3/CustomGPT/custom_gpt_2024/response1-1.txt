Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your current taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Consider a Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect higher taxes later.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits and income eligibility for Roth IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: They offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but may incur capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Check your asset allocation periodically and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Each approach will differ based on your age, income, and retirement goals, so consider those factors when determining your distribution strategy.
