Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and situation. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Pay down any high-interest debt before making larger contributions.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Good for long-term growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer pre-tax benefits, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Decide based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for liquidity and short-term goals, but profits may be taxed at capital gains rates.

4. **Diversity of Investments**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Keep 3-6 months’ worth of expenses in a liquid savings account for emergencies before aggressively investing.

6. **Investment Goals**: Assess your timeline. Longer timelines may favor more aggressive investments in your retirement accounts, while shorter ones might be more conservative.

7. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy as your financial situation or goals change.
