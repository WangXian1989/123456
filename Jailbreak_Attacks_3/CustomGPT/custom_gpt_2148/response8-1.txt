The best way to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, aim to at least contribute enough to get the full match; this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal. Best for higher-income years.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and interest are taxed, but they offer flexibility.

### 3. **Diversify Across Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Consider putting higher-risk investments here for long-term growth since these funds are typically not touched until retirement.
   - **IRA (or Roth IRA)**: Use for more stable investments, or according to your risk tolerance, to benefit from tax-free growth in the case of a Roth.
   - **Taxable Account**: Use for more liquid investments or as a place for assets that produce capital gains, which can be taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. **Balance Your Portfolio**
   - Adjust the types of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your age and risk tolerance. Younger investors can typically take on more risk.

### 5. **Stay Within Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, itâ€™s $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (with catch-up contributions for those age 50+).

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Periodically review your allocation as your financial situation changes (e.g., salary increases, market fluctuations).

### Conclusion
Start by maximizing your 401(k) contributions to get any employer match, then consider funding your IRA, and finally allocate funds to taxable accounts if you have surplus savings. Tailor your strategy based on your personal tax situation and investment timelines. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized recommendations.
