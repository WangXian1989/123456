Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Determine Your Goals:**
   - **Retirement Savings:** Prioritize your 401(k) and IRA contributions if your goal is long-term retirement savings.
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for goals within the next 5-10 years.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

### 3. **Assess Your Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k):** For 2023, the maximum contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50+).
   - **IRA:** The contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50+).

### 4. **Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient assets (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Focus on assets that may generate higher returns in a tax-advantaged environment.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments within each account to reduce risk.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Reassess your asset allocation periodically based on your changing financial situation and market conditions.

### 7. **Consider Professional Advice:**
   - Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. Max out the 401(k) up to the employer match.
2. Contribute to an IRA.
3. Invest additional savings in taxable accounts.

This method helps build a balanced, tax-efficient investment portfolio over time.
