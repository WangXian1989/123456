Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions (401(k))**
   - **Take advantage of any employer match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Start with tax-deferred accounts** (401(k) and IRA): These accounts allow your money to grow tax-free until withdrawal.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k). Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

### 3. **Balance Fund Types**
   - **Diversify your investments**: Within each account, spread your investments across a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance and goals.

### 4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - **Hold tax-efficient investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax impact.
   - **Consider taxable accounts for short-term goals**: If you need access to funds before retirement age, a taxable account provides more flexibility.

### 5. **Regular Consideration and Rebalancing**
   - **Review your allocations annually**: Make adjustments based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, finding the right distribution strategy may require a tailored approach, possibly involving consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance that considers your unique circumstances and objectives.
