To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if you can (for 2023, the limit is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA (up to $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs give you an upfront tax deduction.

2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals. Typically, equities are more suitable for long-term, tax-advantaged accounts due to their growth potential and long time horizon.
   - Bonds and fixed income can be placed in tax-deferred accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Consider keeping cash or short-term investments here, as you can more easily access funds without tax penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Diversify your investments to spread risk. Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments based on your time horizon.

5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change. Adjust contributions based on performance and life circumstances.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy based on your unique situation.

Balancing contributions among these accounts strategically can enhance your savings and investment growth over time.
