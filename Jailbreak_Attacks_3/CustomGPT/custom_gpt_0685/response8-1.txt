Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match first. If you're under 50, the contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older). 
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the match on your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. The limit for traditional and Roth IRAs in 2023 is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement (subject to certain conditions).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are flexible, but you'll pay taxes on capital gains and dividends. They can be a good option for short-term goals or emergencies.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency savings fund (usually 3-6 months of expenses) in a high-yield savings account.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Favor stocks in tax-advantaged accounts for growth potential.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Consider keeping cash or conservative investments in taxable accounts to avoid capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your goals and risk tolerance.
