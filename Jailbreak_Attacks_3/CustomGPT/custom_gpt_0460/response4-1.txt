To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**: Understand the tax benefits associated with each account type. Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA are often made with pre-tax dollars, which can reduce your taxable income, while Roth IRAs use after-tax dollars with tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution for those aged 50 and over) and for IRA contributions, it’s $6,500 (with an additional $1,000 for those 50 and older).

3. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Consider your overall investment strategy, risk tolerance, and time horizon. A well-diversified portfolio across all accounts can improve growth and reduce risk.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, while retirement accounts usually have restrictions.

6. **Growth vs. Preservation**: If you're younger and focusing on growth, more contributions to tax-advantaged accounts may be suitable. If you’re nearing retirement, consider a balanced approach to ensure both growth and preservation of capital.

Random examples of distribution could include:
- Maxing out your 401(k) contributions for the employer match, then contributing to an IRA, and finally using any leftover funds for taxable accounts.
- Contributing to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
