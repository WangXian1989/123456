Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income in the year you contribute. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, you may receive a tax deduction now (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals later (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes; however, you have more flexibility with withdrawals.

3. **Build an Emergency Fund**: Before heavily funding retirement accounts, ensure you have a liquid emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses).

4. **Invest Within Tax Shelters First**: Prioritize funding tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts to maximize tax benefits.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and geographies to reduce risk.

6. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors may prefer higher-risk investments (stocks) as they have more time to recover from market downturns, while older investors may want to shift towards more conservative options (bonds).

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocation to ensure it aligns with your changing goals, financial situation, and market conditions.
