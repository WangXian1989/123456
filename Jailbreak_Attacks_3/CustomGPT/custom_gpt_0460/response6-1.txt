When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax deferral or possible tax-free growth.
   - Allocate funds to taxable accounts for short-term needs or investments that generate qualified dividends (lower tax rates).

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account type (e.g., 401(k) contribution limits for the year, IRA limits).
   - Prioritize maximizing employer matching contributions in a 401(k) to take full advantage of “free money.”

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider risk tolerance and investment goals for each account type.
   - Use aggressive investments (equities) in tax-advantaged accounts and conservative investments (bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for required minimum distributions (RMDs) from tax-advantaged accounts once you reach a certain age.
   - Use taxable accounts for immediate cash needs while letting tax-advantaged accounts grow.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all types of accounts to spread risk.
   - Regularly rebalance your investments to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

Approaching your distribution with these strategies can help optimize your overall financial growth and minimize tax liabilities. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
