When considering the best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Next, prioritize contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue funding your 401(k). Check the investment options and fees associated with your plan, as these can impact your returns.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts as Needed**: If you still have extra funds to invest after maxing out your retirement accounts, consider putting money into taxable accounts. These can offer flexibility for short-term goals or opportunities for tax-loss harvesting.

5. **Consider a Balanced Approach**: Allocate funds based on your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and investment objectives. A diversified portfolio that balances stocks, bonds, and other assets can help mitigate risk.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Monitor your investment accounts and adjust your contributions and investments as needed based on market performance, personal financial goals, and changes in your situation.

Itâ€™s advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your financial circumstances and goals.
