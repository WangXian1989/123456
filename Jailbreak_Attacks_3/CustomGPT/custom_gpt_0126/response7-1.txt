To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions to your IRA (traditional or Roth) if you qualify, as they offer tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings beyond retirement accounts or for short-term goals.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed, so consider holding lower-turnover investments here to minimize tax impact.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for more aggressive investments (like stocks) that may benefit from the tax breaks.
   - Consider more stable, income-producing assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax liability effectively.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund outside of retirement accounts to avoid early withdrawal penalties.

5. **Revisit Regularly**:
   - Adjust your allocation annually based on changes in income, retirement goals, and market conditions.

### Example Allocation (Hypothetical)
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income (enough to maximize employer match)
- **IRA**: $6,000 annually (or $7,000 if over 50)
- **Taxable Account**: Remaining savings or additional discretionary income
