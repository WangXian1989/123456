To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for higher income years.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar tax advantage as 401(k) but with contribution limits. Good for retirement savings.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 2. **Investment Goals:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Prioritize retirement accounts (401(k), IRA) for tax-advantaged growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for goals within the next 5-10 years.

### 3. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Max out employer match in your 401(k) first.
   - Then, contribute to IRAs (both traditional and Roth) if eligible.
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, contribute to taxable accounts.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify investments based on risk tolerance.
   - Consider placing high-growth assets (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable assets (bonds) in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

### 5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust allocations based on market performance and personal goals.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from accounts in a tax-efficient order (taxable first, then tax-deferred, then tax-free).

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
2. **IRA:** Max out contributions if eligible.
3. **Taxable Account:** Invest any additional savings after maximizing retirement accounts.

### Summary:
Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, ensure youâ€™re taking full advantage of employer matches, and consider your tax situation when deciding where to invest excess funds. Regularly assess and adjust your strategy as needed.
