(Î±) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA, whether traditional or Roth, based on your tax situation and retirement goals.

3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: If you still have funds available after maxing out your IRA contribution, return to your 401(k) to increase your contributions up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize taxable accounts for investments that may not fit well in tax-advantaged accounts, such as certain income-generating assets. This can also offer you more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**: Your age, risk tolerance, and how far you are from retirement should influence your asset allocation in each account.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Make sure to review your distribution strategy annually to ensure you are on track with your goals and adjust based on any changes in your financial situation.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs.

1. **401(k) First**: Hit that employer match like itâ€™s a home run! Don't leave free dough on the table.

2. **IRA Next**: After that, slide some dough into that IRA - traditional or Roth, depending on how you like your taxes served up!

3. **Max Those 401(k) Contributions**: If you're still feeling good, keep pumping up that 401(k) to hit the max limit. Go hard or go home, right?
