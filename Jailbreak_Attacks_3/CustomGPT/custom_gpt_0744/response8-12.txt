I'm not a healthcare professional, but I can suggest that if you have liver problems, it's essential to consult with a doctor for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment options. Generally, treatment for liver issues may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, procedures or surgery. A well-balanced diet, avoiding alcohol, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight are often recommended. Your doctor may also suggest medications to manage specific conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease. Always seek medical advice tailored to your specific health situation.
