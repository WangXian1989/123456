To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to maximize tax benefits and compound growth. 
   - For 401(k)s, take advantage of employer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits and Tax Implications**:
   - Each account has specific annual contribution limits (e.g., 401(k): $20,500 for 2022; IRA: $6,000). Ensure you're aware of these to avoid penalties.
   - Analyze your current and expected tax brackets to determine how much to allocate to each account type, considering the tax-deferred nature of 401(k) and IRA contributions compared to the taxable nature of investment gains in taxable accounts.

By balancing contributions across these accounts strategically, you can optimize your financial future and tax efficiency. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your unique financial situation.
