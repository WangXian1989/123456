(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s essential to take into account your financial goals, retirement timeline, and tax implications. Generally, it is beneficial to maximize contributions to your employer's 401(k), especially if they offer a match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth. Finally, use taxable accounts for investments that may require liquidity or when you've maxed out other options. Itâ€™s also important to diversify your investment portfolios across these accounts to manage risk effectively. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation.

So, max that sucker out first! Then you can funnel some dough into your IRA â€“ traditional or Roth, depending on whether you want your taxes now or later. Finally, once you've squeezed those tax-advantaged accounts dry, hit up your taxable accounts for any excess cash. Theyâ€™ll give you the flexibility for investments you might need sooner rather than later. But don't forget to throw in some diversification on top of that! Mix it up so youâ€™re not all in one basket. And hey, you could always grab a coffee with a financial advisor for a personalized game plan. Canâ€™t hurt, right?
