The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that offer first.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. This is a good option if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions grow tax-free. Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can be used flexibly and are not subject to the same withdrawal rules as retirement accounts. They are good for short-term goals.

3. **Diversify Investment Options**: Consider using different accounts for different types of investments. For example:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for bonds or other income-producing investments that generate taxable interest.
   - Hold stocks in taxable accounts if they can benefit from favorable long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Reassess Based on Life Events**: Major life changes such as salary increases, job changes, or market fluctuations can affect your distribution strategy. Adjust contributions accordingly.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a financial planner can help tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation and goals.
