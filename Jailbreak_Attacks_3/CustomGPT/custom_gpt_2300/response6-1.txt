To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Each Account's Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers potential employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Allows for tax-deductible contributions (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA) depending on your choice.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties, but may require you to pay taxes on capital gains and interest.

2. **Assess Your Financial Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If you're saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize your tax benefits.
   - If you have shorter-term goals, allocate a portion to your taxable accounts for liquidity.

3. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account, considering risk tolerance.
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while allocating lower-growth investments to taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Regular Contributions and Rebalancing**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match in your 401(k) first, then maximize your IRA contributions, and finally add to your taxable accounts.
   - Periodically rebalance your investments based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
