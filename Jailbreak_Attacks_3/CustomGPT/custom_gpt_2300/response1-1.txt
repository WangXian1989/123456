To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income now. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Consider your current tax rate versus expected retirement tax rate when choosing.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for savings that you might access before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments sold.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you're aware of the contribution limits for each type of account. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

4. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across account types to balance potential taxes, growth, and risk. Consider asset allocation strategies that suit your risk tolerance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when you will withdraw funds from each account in retirement to minimize taxes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If in doubt, getting personalized advice from a financial professional can help align the strategy with your specific situation.
