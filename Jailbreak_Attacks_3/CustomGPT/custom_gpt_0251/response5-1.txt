Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income. Consider maxing this out or contributing enough for the match.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect higher taxes in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on risk tolerance and time horizon, trying to balance growth (stocks) with stability (bonds).

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially as you near retirement.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Understand the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type during retirement to minimize overall taxes.

### Conclusion:
A balanced strategy tailored to your situation that utilizes tax advantages and employer benefits is key. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
