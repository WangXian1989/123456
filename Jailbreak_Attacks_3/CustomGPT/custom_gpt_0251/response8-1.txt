Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund IRA**: Consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Prioritize Traditional contributions if you want immediate tax benefits.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for savings that you may need before retirement. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**: Keep more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in retirement accounts to defer taxes, and hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust based on performance, tax laws, and your personal situation.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific circumstances.
