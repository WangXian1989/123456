Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategic considerations:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to get any available employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth**: Decide if you want to contribute on a pre-tax basis (traditional) or after-tax basis (Roth 401(k)), based on your current and expected future tax rate.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Choose based on your income and tax situation. A Traditional IRA may provide upfront tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for IRAs and adjust your funding strategy accordingly.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility and Access**: Use taxable accounts for money you may need access to before retirement, or for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside these accounts for unexpected expenses.
   - **Diversification**: Diversify across asset classes within each account type to manage risk.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to align with your goals and risk tolerance.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.
