Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maximizing contributions to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, based on your eligibility and tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, as they may be taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.

### 3. **Investment Time Horizon**
   - **Long-term (over 10 years):** Focus more on tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) for growth.
   - **Short-term:** Keep more liquid assets in a taxable account for easier access without penalties.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a balanced mix of assets across all accounts to mitigate risks while optimizing returns.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustments**
   - Periodically reassess asset allocation based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and life events.

This balanced approach can help you effectively grow your wealth while managing tax implications.
