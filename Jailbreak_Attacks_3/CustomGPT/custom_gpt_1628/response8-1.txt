To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match, as it’s essentially free money. Consider maxing this out if you can afford it.
   - **IRA**: Aim to contribute to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If your income limits you, consider a traditional IRA.

2. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - For retirement savings that you won’t touch until retirement, prioritize your 401(k) and IRA.
   - For shorter-term goals or potential early withdrawals, focus more on your taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs) can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. Roth accounts are beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher bracket.

4. **Maintain Liquidity**:
   - Keep some funds in taxable accounts for emergencies or opportunities since you can access this money without penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread your investments among various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts for risk management.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations based on performance and any changes in your financial situation or goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
