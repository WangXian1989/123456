I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopt a healthy diet, focusing on fruits, vegetables, whole grains.
   - Limit alcohol intake and avoid drugs that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on your condition (like hepatitis), antiviral medications may be prescribed.
   - For fatty liver disease, medications to manage diabetes or cholesterol could help.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Frequent check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Supportive Care**:
   - Stay hydrated and manage any symptoms like pain.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
