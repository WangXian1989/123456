To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Prioritize these for tax-deferred growth. Max out contributions to take advantage of employer matches in your 401(k) if available.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income, such as stocks, to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Retirement (401(k) & IRA)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments since these funds will be untouched for years.
   - **Short-term needs (Taxable)**: Keep liquid investments here to cover imminent expenses or emergencies.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that match your risk tolerance.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax implications when withdrawing funds. Generally, it’s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.

By combining these strategies, you’ll enhance your overall investment efficiency and potential returns.
