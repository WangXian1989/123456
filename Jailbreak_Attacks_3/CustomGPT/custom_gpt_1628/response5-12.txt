I'm not a doctor, but here are some commonly recommended treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and liver function tests to monitor your condition.

4. **Vaccinations**: Vaccines for hepatitis A and B may be recommended.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, like liver cancer or cirrhosis, procedures such as liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
