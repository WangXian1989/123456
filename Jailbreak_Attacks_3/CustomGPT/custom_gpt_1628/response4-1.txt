Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum limit for tax-deferred growth. This is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to increase in the future. For a traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income now.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you may want to access before retirement. This account can also be useful for capital gains advantages with long-term investments.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Keep taxable investments for assets with favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains).
   - Hold bonds or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals. 

5. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider discussing your strategy with a financial advisor to tailor it to your specific situation.

This approach helps maximize growth potential while managing tax liabilities effectively.
