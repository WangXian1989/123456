Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA (traditional or Roth) for its tax advantages. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Finish 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, redirect contributions to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate high short-term capital gains or interest, as these will be taxed at your ordinary income rate.

5. **Consider Taxes**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies in your taxable accounts; for example, focus on holding investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As you approach retirement, adjust your allocation to reduce risk by moving some funds into more conservative investments.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
