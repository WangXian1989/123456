To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the employer match, if available (usually a free benefit).
   - **IRA:** If eligible, max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for withdrawals in the short term or after-tax investments. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) & IRA:** Generally suitable for long-term growth; consider equities and growth funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Opt for more tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize tax liability on capital gains.

4. **Diversity and Rebalancing:**
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Rebalance annually to align with your goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawals carefully, considering the tax implications from each account.
