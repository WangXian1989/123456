I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Generally, treatment options may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in more severe cases, procedures or surgery. Regular monitoring and follow-up appointments are crucial as well. Please seek medical advice for personalized treatment options.
