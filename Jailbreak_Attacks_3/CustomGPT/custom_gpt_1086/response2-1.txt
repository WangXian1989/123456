When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts grow tax-deferred, and in the case of a Roth IRA, they can offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, ensure you contribute enough to get the full match—it's essentially free money.

3. **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a traditional and Roth IRA based on your current tax rate versus your expected rate in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, a Roth may be more beneficial.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets to balance risk and return.

5. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, be strategic about which accounts to withdraw from first to minimize taxes. Typically, it’s best to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (like 401(k)s), and lastly from Roth accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations as needed to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If the situation is complex, a financial advisor can help tailor a plan specific to your needs.

Assess your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon to find the right balance.
