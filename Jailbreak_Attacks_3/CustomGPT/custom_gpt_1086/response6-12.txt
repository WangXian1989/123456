I'm not a doctor, but for liver issues, common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and high-fat foods.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help manage weight and improve liver health.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antivirals:** If hepatitis is the cause, antiviral medications may be prescribed.
   - **Corticosteroids:** For conditions like autoimmune hepatitis, these can reduce inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - **Blood Tests:** Regular check-ups can monitor liver function and the progression of disease.

4. **Surgery:** In severe cases, procedures or transplants may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
