To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Max out contributions or contribute to the limit if your employer matches.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Investment Types**: 
   - In tax-advantaged accounts, focus on higher-growth investments (like stocks) since withdrawals will be taxed later or potentially tax-free.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance and Adjust**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consider Fees**: Pay attention to fees associated with each investment account, as high fees can erode returns over time.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your goals and risk tolerance.

This balanced approach helps optimize your investment growth while managing tax implications.
