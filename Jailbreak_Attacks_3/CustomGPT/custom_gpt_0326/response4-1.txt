I'm not a financial advisor, but a common approach is to focus on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first. 

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's free money.
2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth or Traditional IRA for additional tax benefits.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments needing more liquidity and flexibility.

The exact percentages can vary based on your goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Itâ€™s often helpful to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
