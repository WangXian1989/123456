To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate high short-term capital gains or interest, which are taxed at your ordinary income rate.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.

4. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Monitor your allocations periodically to adjust for market changes and personal financial goals.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain sufficient liquid savings in an accessible account for unforeseen expenses.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific financial situation.
