Distributing money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Here are some key strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Roth vs. Traditional**:
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, which can be beneficial if you expect a lower tax rate in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA/401(k)**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, providing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider this if you expect a higher tax rate later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you max out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for more flexible access to funds or investments that may not be tax-efficient in retirement accounts.

4. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - **Growth Investments**: Place higher-risk investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA to defer taxes on growth.
   - **Income Investments**: Consider placing bonds or other income-generating assets in taxable accounts to benefit from favorable tax treatment on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level and asset allocation.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy to minimize taxes in retirement, such as withdrawing from taxable accounts first if you're in a lower tax bracket.
