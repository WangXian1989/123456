To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is free money and provides immediate returns.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Benefit from tax deferral; contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA or Roth IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Keep a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate emergency fund outside these accounts to avoid early withdrawals that could incur penalties.

5. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Adjust contributions based on your current and expected future tax brackets. Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains to minimize immediate tax impact.

6. **Regularly Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your specific circumstances.
