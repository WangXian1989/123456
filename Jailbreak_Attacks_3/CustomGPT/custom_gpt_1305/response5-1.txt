(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general tips:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. It's essentially free money.
  
2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Aim to max out contributions in your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts provide tax benefits that can help your money grow more efficiently. 

3. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Once you've maximized contributions in tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional investments. These are flexible and allow for easier access to your funds.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Remember that 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from Roth IRAs can be tax-free. Taxable accounts may also have capital gains taxes to consider.

It's always recommended to consult a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific circumstances.

Next, donâ€™t sleep on that IRA. Whether itâ€™s traditional or Roth, max that bad boy out if you can. Those tax breaks are gold! After you hit your limits there, then you can spread your wings into the taxable accounts. Just keep an eye on capital gains taxes; theyâ€™ll sneak up on you like a thief in the night.

Ultimately, balance is key â€“ donâ€™t just throw money everywhere. Think about your future self with a well-planned strategy. You might also wanna chat with a financial advisor to make sure you're not just winging it!
