Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Plans:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Maximize contributions if possible, as they typically provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Stay within the annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for investments that may need to be accessed before retirement age, or for investing in things that aren't allowed in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Be mindful of the tax implications; capital gains tax can affect your net returns.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these accounts (3-6 months of expenses).
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the match, and then consider maxing it out.
- **IRA:** After the 401(k), contribute to an IRA. Consider doing a Roth or Traditional based on tax strategy.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Once those are maxed, you can invest additional savings in taxable accounts.

### Considerations:
- **Investment Goals:** Think about when you'll need the money and for what purpose.
- **Tax Impact:** Be aware of how withdrawals from these accounts will affect your overall tax situation.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
For personalized advice suited to your specific situation, it’s always wise to consult with a financial advisor. They can guide you based on your unique circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance.
