The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If you are eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement (assuming you meet the criteria), while Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible.

3. **Prioritize High-Earning Accounts**:
   - Funds in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) can often grow more efficiently than taxable accounts because they are either tax-deferred or tax-free. Thus, consider putting higher-risk investments that have the potential for significant capital gains in these accounts.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more advantageous. Conversely, if you think youâ€™ll be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA could be better.

5. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Within these accounts, make sure to have a diversified investment strategy, including a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to spread risk.

6. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - If you have maxed out contributions to retirement accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility, allowing you to withdraw funds without penalties.

7. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment distribution and be prepared to adjust your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.

Keep in mind that consulting with a financial advisor may provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
