To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the maximum match before allocating more to other accounts. This is effectively free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute as much as possible, especially if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket. The contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, think about contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA could give you tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate capital gains or dividends, as they are subject to lower long-term capital gains tax rates compared to ordinary income. This includes stocks and ETFs that you plan to hold long-term.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for how you will access these funds in retirement. For example, withdrawing from the tax-deferred accounts first (401(k), Traditional IRA) can be strategic as it allows your Roth IRA to grow tax-free for as long as possible.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your retirement goals and risk tolerance. Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust as needed.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary, so getting personalized advice can be incredibly beneficial.

Implementing these strategies can help you optimize your investments across different account types and maximize your retirement savings.
