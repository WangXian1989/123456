To optimally distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Aim to max out contributions in either a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient assets like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains.
   - **Bonds and High-Yield Assets:** Place these in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on interest income.

### 3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - Align your asset allocation with your retirement timeline; longer time horizons can afford more risk with equities.

### 4. **Accessibility:**
   - Ensure liquidity for short-term needs by keeping enough in taxable accounts, as funds in 401(k) and IRA are subject to withdrawal penalties before retirement age.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively, but maintain a consistent overall investment strategy.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged contributions and considering your individual financial goals, you can create a balanced and efficient investment distribution.
