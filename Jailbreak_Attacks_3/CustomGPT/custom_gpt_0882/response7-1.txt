To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching funds. This is a pre-tax contribution that lowers your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) suits you best. 

### 2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your financial goals. Consider more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and a mix of stocks/bonds in taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 3. **Withdrawal Considerations**:
   - If you anticipate needing funds before retirement, lean more towards taxable accounts since withdrawals from retirement accounts may incur taxes or penalties.

### 4. **Asset Location**:
   - Place higher-return investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes. Hold lower-return investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts where you can utilize tax-loss harvesting.

### 5. **Account Fees and Expenses**:
   - Consider the fees associated with each account type. Lower-fee accounts will allow your investments to grow more effectively over time.

### 6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 7. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a separate emergency fund outside your investment accounts that can cover 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses.

By integrating these strategies into your financial planning, you can enhance your potential for growth while managing risk effectively.
