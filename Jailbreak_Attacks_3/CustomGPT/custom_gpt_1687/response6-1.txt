Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a structured approach to help you make the best decision:

### 1. **Evaluate Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Goals:** Determine how much you need for retirement and when you plan to retire.
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term Needs:** Assess any upcoming expenses or investments.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically tax-deferred, which means you pay taxes upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes when sold.

### 3. **Max Out Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions each year ($6,500 for 2023; $7,500 if over 50).

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Based on your age and risk profile, consider a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - **Account Type:** Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to benefit from tax deferral. Use taxable accounts for more stable, income-generating investments.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations annually or as significant life events occur.

### Conclusion
Creating a balanced investment strategy across different account types can optimize your tax situation and help you achieve both short-term and long-term financial goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.
