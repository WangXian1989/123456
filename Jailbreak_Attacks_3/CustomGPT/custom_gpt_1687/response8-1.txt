Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**
   - Consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your income and tax situation). Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them very advantageous.

### 3. **Return to 401(k)** 
   - After maxing out the IRA, direct additional funds to your 401(k). This benefits from the same tax advantages and high contribution limits.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - If you have additional funds after contributing to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts. They offer flexibility for accessing funds, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on any investment gains.

### 5. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Ensure a balanced mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts. Tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) should preferably be in tax-advantaged accounts, while tax-efficient investments (like index funds) can go in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Withdrawals from traditional 401(k) and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains from taxable accounts are usually taxed at a lower rate. Plan withdrawals accordingly in retirement to minimize tax burden.

### 7. **Revisit and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your distribution and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, market performance, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help personalize the strategy based on your specific situation.
