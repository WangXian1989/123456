Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, investment goals, and tax situation. Here's a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. Use Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. Assess Tax Implications
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. These can be useful for short-term goals or if you're over the contribution limits for tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. Diversify Investments
- **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a good mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts. This helps manage risk.

### 5. Consider Your Withdrawals
- **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds later. For example, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 6. Regularly Review and Rebalance
- Periodically check your allocations and adjust as needed based on performance and changing goals.

### 7. Seek Professional Advice
- If you're unsure, consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific needs.

This structured approach will help you maximize your savings and investments over time.
