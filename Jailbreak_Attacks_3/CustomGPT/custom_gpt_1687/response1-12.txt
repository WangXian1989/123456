1. **Lifestyle Changes:** 
   - Diet: A balanced diet low in fats and sugars can help.
   - Exercise: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.
   - Alcohol avoidance: Limiting or eliminating alcohol is essential.

2. **Medications:** Depending on the condition, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Monitoring and Management:** Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function can be necessary.

4. **Treating Underlying Causes:**
   - For hepatitis, antiviral medications may be prescribed.
   - For fatty liver disease, managing conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol is crucial.

5. **Surgery:** In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation might be necessary.

Always discuss with your healthcare provider for tailored advice and treatment options.
