Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, you may get tax deductions now (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals later (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains. They provide flexibility but can be less tax-efficient for long-term growth.

3. **Build an Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough in cash or liquid assets to cover unexpected expenses before investing heavily.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Review Contributions**:
   - Start with maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, as both have annual limits.
   - If you still have leftover funds, consider investing in a taxable account for flexibility.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Consider your future income needs and the tax impact of withdrawals from each account type during retirement.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that aligns with your unique financial situation and goals.
