To optimize your money distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Investment Types**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Hold bonds and other income-producing assets in your 401(k) and IRA to defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on holding stocks for long-term growth, as they benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Assessment**
   - Ensure your investments reflect your risk tolerance and financial goals, regardless of the account type.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy Planning**
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement, using the taxable account first to minimize taxes on your tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**
   - Regularly assess your portfolio across all accounts, ensuring it remains aligned with your goals and market conditions.

By strategically allocating funds based on tax implications and investment growth, you can maximize your overall returns.
