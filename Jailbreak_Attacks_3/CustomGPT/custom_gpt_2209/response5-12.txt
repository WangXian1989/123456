I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. Itâ€™s crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, exercising regularly, and quitting alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, certain medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation, manage symptoms, or treat underlying causes like viral hepatitis.

3. **Monitor and Manage**: Regular monitoring through blood tests and imaging studies can help track liver health and function.

4. **Surgery**: In cases of liver tumors or severe liver damage, surgical options like resections or transplants might be considered.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore herbal supplements, but these should be approached with caution and discussed with a healthcare provider.

Always seek medical advice for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
