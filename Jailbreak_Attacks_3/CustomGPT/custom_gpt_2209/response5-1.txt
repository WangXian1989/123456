Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes until withdrawal. Maximize contributions to these accounts first, especially if your employer offers a match on your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold. This may be suitable for short-term savings or investments that require more liquidity.

### 2. **Investment Goals:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on the tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term investments, such as stocks or mutual funds.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep more liquid investments in taxable accounts for potential withdrawals without penalties.

### 3. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits: As of 2023, for 401(k)s, you can contribute up to $22,500 ($30,000 if you're 50 or older), while IRAs have a limit of $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** High-risk investments (like stocks) may perform better in tax-advantaged accounts to shield from taxes on capital gains.
   - **Fixed Income:** Consider placing bonds or fixed-income investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of their lower tax rates (like municipal bonds).

### 5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio across these accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Summary:
Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) for the employer match, then your IRA for its tax benefits, and finally invest in taxable accounts for liquidity or shorter-term goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
