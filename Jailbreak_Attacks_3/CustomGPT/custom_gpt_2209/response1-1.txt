To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Utilize the tax-deferred nature of your 401(k) for higher growth potential.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now, whereas Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your choice depends on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: Keep track of maximum contributions to stay within IRS limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility and Liquidity**: Use these for short-term goals or to bridge gaps before retirement. 
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Diversify Investments**: Balance stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations in response to market changes and life events.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: In taxable accounts, sell losing investments to offset gains and reduce tax liability.
   - **Recognize Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**: For 401(k)s and IRAs, plan withdrawals to avoid penalties.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring a plan specific to your financial situation can help optimize your retirement strategy.

Prioritize investments based on your unique goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon to maximize growth and minimize taxes effectively.
