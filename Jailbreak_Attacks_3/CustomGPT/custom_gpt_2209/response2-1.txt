The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). 

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: 
     - **Traditional IRAs** allow for tax-deductible contributions, reducing taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed in retirement.
     - **Roth IRAs** allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need to access before retirement.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or tax-managed funds to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Use for Short-Term Goals**: Allocate funds in taxable accounts for short- to medium-term goals (e.g., buying a house, travel).

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds) within each account to mitigate risk.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 6. **Consider Your Current and Future Tax Bracket**
   - If youâ€™re in a lower tax bracket now and expect to be higher in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts. Conversely, if you expect your income to decrease, traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out 401(k) contributions at least up to the employer match.**
- **Consider funding a Roth IRA** for additional tax-advantaged growth.
- **Fill up a taxable account with surplus funds**, focusing on long-term investments.

### Conclusion
Consulting with a financial advisor can further tailor this approach to your specific situation and goals. Making informed decisions based on your circumstances can optimize your overall financial strategy.
