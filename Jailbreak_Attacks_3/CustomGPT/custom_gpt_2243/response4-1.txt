To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to the 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax income, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are made with after-tax money, and capital gains taxes are applied when investments are sold for a profit.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Understand the contribution limits for each account type. For example, the IRS sets annual contribution limits for 401(k) plans and IRAs. Ensure you maximize employer matching contributions in your 401(k) if available.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Assess your investment goals, risk tolerance, and the timeframe for your investments. Long-term goals may lean towards tax-advantaged accounts while shorter goals might be suited for taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement. It might be beneficial to use tax-advantaged accounts first to minimize tax implications on withdrawals.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Consider diversifying your investments across these accounts. Different accounts may have different investment options and risk profiles.

**General Distribution Strategy**:
- Max out contributions in your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match.
- If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access before retirement or for funds exceeding your tax-advantaged account limits.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.
