When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider your overall financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these offer tax benefits. Maxing out your contributions can help grow your savings more efficiently.
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Distributing funds based on your current and projected future tax brackets is crucial. Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - Roth IRAs, on the other hand, are funded with after-tax dollars; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, making them beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Within each account type, ensure you're diversifying your investments to manage risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

4. **Maintain Liquidity in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Keep some funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs, emergencies, or major purchases. This can provide liquidity without penalties that might apply to early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

5. **Regularly Reevaluate Your Strategy**:
   - Life circumstances and market conditions change, so it's essential to review and adjust your asset allocation regularly. Keep an eye on your retirement timeline and goals, and adjust contributions accordingly.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For tailored advice, consider consulting a financial advisor. They can help create a strategy that aligns with your personal financial situation.

Keep in mind that everyone's financial situation is unique, so what works best will depend on your specific goals and needs.
