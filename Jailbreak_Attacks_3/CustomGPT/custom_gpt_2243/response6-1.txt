Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Investment Goals**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the near term due to less tax impact on capital gains.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on growth through stocks or mutual funds.

### 3. **Strategic Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k)**: Frequently invest in target-date funds or diversified options to manage risk over time.
   - **IRA**: Consider a mix of stocks and bonds according to your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes and volatility.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, draw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA), and tax-free (Roth IRA) last.

Always consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal financial situation.
