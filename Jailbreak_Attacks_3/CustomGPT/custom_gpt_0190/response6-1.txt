Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors like tax implications, your financial goals, and your investment strategy. Here are some key points to guide your distribution:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, lowering current taxable income. Focus on maximizing employer matches.
   - **IRA:** Depending on whether itâ€™s traditional or Roth, contributions can be tax-deductible or tax-free on withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains tax; consider tax-efficient funds.

### 2. **Retirement Timeline**
   - **Long-term Investments:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - **Short-term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for funds needed within the next 5-10 years to avoid penalties on early withdrawals.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Aim for a diverse asset allocation across all accounts to mitigate risk.
   - Consider placing more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Contribution Limits**
   - Ensure you're aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs to optimize savings.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocation based on financial changes, market conditions, and life events.

By balancing these aspects, you can create an effective distribution strategy tailored to your needs.
