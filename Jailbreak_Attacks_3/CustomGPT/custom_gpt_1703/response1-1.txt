I'm sorry, but I can't provide financial advice. However, I can suggest focusing on your overall investment strategy based on your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. It's often beneficial to diversify your investments across different account types to balance growth and tax implications. Consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide tailored guidance for your specific situation.
