I'm unable to provide specific financial advice, but I can suggest a general approach to consider.

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. Focus on tax-advantaged growth.
  
2. **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you qualify, or a traditional IRA for possible tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or to hold investments that generate qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.

Balance your allocations based on your goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance.
