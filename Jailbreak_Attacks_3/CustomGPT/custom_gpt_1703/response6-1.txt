Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution**: Contribute enough to get the full match if your employer offers one.
   - **Reason**: This is essentially "free money" and a guaranteed return on your investment.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Types**: Depending on your income and eligibility, consider a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA.
   - **Reason**: These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth (Roth allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Invest in taxable accounts** after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Reason**: They provide liquidity and flexibility, suitable for goals outside retirement.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Bracket**: If youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA).
   - **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of long-term vs. short-term capital gains when investing in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance in each account type.
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your goals.

### Conclusion
- Evaluate your current financial situation and future goals.
- Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.
