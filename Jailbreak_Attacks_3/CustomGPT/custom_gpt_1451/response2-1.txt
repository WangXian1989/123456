Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRAs**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide a tax deduction, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 

3. **Diversify Across Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on tax-deferred growth. Consider a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Use this account to hold investments that may appreciate significantly, as you can manage taxes more effectively with a mix of taxable and tax-advantaged investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) and consider holding investments for at least a year to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

4. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that down before contributing heavily to retirement accounts.

5. **Adjust Based on Tax Situation**: Be mindful of your tax bracket. In a high-income year, contributing to a Traditional IRA or 401(k) can help reduce taxable income.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly assess your investment performance, risk tolerance, and any changes in your financial situation or goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
