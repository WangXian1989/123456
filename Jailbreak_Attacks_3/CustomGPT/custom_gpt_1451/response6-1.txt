Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here are some key points to consider:

### 1. **Retirement Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA are often tax-deductible, which can reduce your taxable income.
   - **Consider Roth Options:** If available, consider a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexible Access:** Use taxable accounts for any savings goals that may require access before retirement, such as buying a home or paying for education.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Overall Allocation Strategy**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a liquid account.
   - **Growth vs. Stability:** Balance your investments based on your age and risk toleranceâ€”more aggressive (stocks) for long-term accounts, and more conservative (bonds) for shorter-term goals.
   - **Review Regularly:** Adjust your allocation as your financial situation and goals evolve.
