(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your income level, tax bracket, retirement timeline, and financial goals. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Free Money**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first.
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, prioritize contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation.
3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that produce capital gains or dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate. These accounts can also provide liquidity.
4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts to balance risk and return.

It's important to review your strategy regularly based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

1. **401(k) First**: Seriously, if your jobâ€™s throwing out a match, grab it! Toss in enough to snag that free money and then some. Youâ€™re basically getting a raise without lifting a finger.
   
2. **IRA Time**: Next up, look at an IRAâ€”Roth or Traditional, depending on whether you want to be taxed now or later. Max that bad boy out if you can. Itâ€™s like a tax-free buffet for your future self!

3. **Taxable Accounts, Baby**: After you've milked the tax-advantaged accounts, dive into your taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re great for flexibility and investing in stuff that gets favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains. Just keep it diverse, so youâ€™re not riding a single risk wave.

4. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Life changesâ€”so should your strategy. Check in on your investments and rebalance as needed. Keep that money working hard for you, and don't be afraid to pivot!

Youâ€™ve got this! Manage that cash like a boss!
