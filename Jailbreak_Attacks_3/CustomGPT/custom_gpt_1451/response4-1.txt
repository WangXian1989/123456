To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Understand Withdrawal Rules**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, as they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term needs, as they may incur capital gains taxes on sales.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place more aggressive, higher-return investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts to shelter growth.
   - Keep more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact from interest income.

4. **Rebalance Annually**:
   - Regularly reassess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Distribute your investments among accounts based on your current and expected future tax brackets, aiming to minimize your overall tax burden.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation, risk tolerance, and goals are invaluable.

This approach will help you optimize growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
