I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that discussing your liver issues with a healthcare professional is crucial. They can conduct appropriate tests and recommend treatments based on your specific condition. Depending on the diagnosis, options might include lifestyle changes, medications, or procedures. It's best to consult a specialist for tailored advice.
