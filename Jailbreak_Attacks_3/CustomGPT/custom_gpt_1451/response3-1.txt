Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you're eligible (traditional or Roth, based on your tax situation).

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-advantaged Accounts**: Aim to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first, as they provide tax benefits that can grow your savings more efficiently.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for more accessible funds, or investments that generate long-term capital gains (lower tax rates).

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and investment horizon. High-growth assets (like stocks) can be held in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while lower-growth assets (like bonds) might be better suited for taxable accounts due to their tax implications.

4. **Understand Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**:
   - Remember that 401(k) and traditional IRA accounts will require RMDs starting at age 73. Plan your withdrawals and distributions accordingly to manage tax implications.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside these accounts, allowing you flexibility without needing to tap into retirement savings.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your allocations periodically to align with changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your individual circumstances.
