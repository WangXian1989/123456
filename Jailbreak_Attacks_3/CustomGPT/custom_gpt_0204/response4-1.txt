To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and future expectations.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your current taxable income. Good for high-income earners.
   - **IRA**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Potential tax deduction now; taxes owed upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed upfront; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

3. **Investment Options**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers a limited selection of mutual funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Greater investment flexibility including stocks, bonds, and ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for more aggressive investments; focus on tax-efficient options to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for growth first; use taxable accounts for shorter-term needs or after reaching a certain income threshold.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund before heavily investing to ensure liquidity.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.
