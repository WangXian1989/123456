It's essential to allocate your investments based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies for distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is free money.
   - After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. You can choose between a Traditional IRA if you want potential tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

2. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Place more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, in your taxable accounts.
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts where you can minimize tax impacts.

3. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts to reduce risk. This might involve holding a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account.

4. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**: 
   - Allocate more funds to long-term growth in retirement accounts, while potentially keeping more liquid assets in your taxable account for short-term financial goals.

5. **Regular Reassessment**: 
   - Review your allocations regularly, especially as market conditions or your personal circumstances change.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation. They can help you design a comprehensive plan that aligns with your goals.
