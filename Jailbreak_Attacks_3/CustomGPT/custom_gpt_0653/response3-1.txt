To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred retirement account with potential employer matching.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Individual retirement accounts, with different tax implications depending on the type.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments that do not have tax advantages, where you pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Know the annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If available, contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions, as this is free money and should be prioritized.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions lower your taxable income for the year, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains taxes apply when you sell assets, and you will also pay taxes on any dividends received.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account. For long-term growth, consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) and place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts when possible.

6. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**:
   - Younger investors may prefer aggressive growth strategies, while those closer to retirement may focus on preserving capital.
   - Your risk tolerance and investment goals should guide how you allocate funds across these accounts.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Review your portfolio at least annually to ensure that your allocations align with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

By strategically distributing your funds across these accounts, you can optimize your tax efficiency and enhance your retirement savings. It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.
