Hello and welcome back! It seems you may be asking about financial planning rather than TypeScript, which is my specialty. If you're looking for financial advice, it’s best to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance. 

However, if you have any TypeScript-related questions or projects you’d like to discuss, I’d be thrilled to help! What's on your mind in the world of TypeScript today? Happy Coding!
