Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. That’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Taxation**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Contributions are typically pre-tax (for traditional accounts) or post-tax (for Roth accounts), and the money grows tax-deferred. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed (traditional) or tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell, and any dividends or interest earned are taxable in the year received.

3. **Diversification of Accounts**:
   - Consider your withdrawal strategy. Having funds in different types of accounts can provide flexibility in retirement to manage your tax burden.
   - Generally, it’s wise to keep higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of how much you can contribute annually to each type of account:
   - 401(k): For 2024, annual contributions are capped at $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're aged 50 or older).
   - IRA: Annual contributions are capped at $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
  
5. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a readily accessible account.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial goals, market conditions, and life circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Adjusting your allocations can significantly impact your financial future, so it’s worth taking the time to strategize!
