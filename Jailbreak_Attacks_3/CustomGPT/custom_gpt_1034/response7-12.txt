I'm not equipped to provide medical advice, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional who can evaluate your specific liver condition. Typically, treatment options may include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, medications, or in some cases, more advanced treatments. Always seek guidance from a qualified doctor for the best outcome for your health.
