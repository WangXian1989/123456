Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors like your current financial situation, tax implications, and retirement goals. Here’s a general strategy to think about:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Aim to maximize contributions to these accounts because they offer tax benefits. 
   - For traditional accounts, contributions can lower your taxable income. For Roth accounts, withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - The contribution limits for 2023 are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (additional $1,000 if 50 or older).

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last:** After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments. This is useful for accessibility, but you’ll be responsible for capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

4. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change, and adjust your contributions accordingly.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice tailored to your unique situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

This approach can help you maximize your retirement savings while being mindful of tax implications.
