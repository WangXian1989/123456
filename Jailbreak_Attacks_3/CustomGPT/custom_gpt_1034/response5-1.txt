(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, itâ€™s wise to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first, as these can grow tax-deferred or tax-free. 

- **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”itâ€™s essentially free money.
- **IRA:** Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement. Traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction, which can be beneficial now.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for shorter-term goals or once youâ€™ve maxed out your tax-advantaged contributions. Interest and dividends here are taxable in the year they're received, so be mindful of the investments you choose.

Balancing your contributions will require reviewing your overall financial picture and possibly consulting with a financial advisor.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Okay, letâ€™s break it down! The best way to divvy up your cash among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is to play it smart. First up, max out that 401(k) to snag any employer matchâ€”free bucks! 

1. **401(k):** Hit that match limit like itâ€™s a piÃ±ata; itâ€™s basically a guarantee you donâ€™t wanna miss. After that, consider going hard on your IRA contributionsâ€”think of it as putting your future self in a comfy chair.
   
2. **IRA:** Depending on whether youâ€™re feeling like a tax ninja or wanting to avoid later paydays, choose between Roth or Traditional. Roth if you wanna pay taxes now and let your future self thank you with tax-free withdrawals, or Traditional if you want to save some cash now.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, shift to taxable. These are your playground for investments, but be aware of the tax hit on gains. Play smart with dividend stocks or long-term growth to minimize those taxes.

In the end, itâ€™s about balancing those accounts based on your goals and lifestyle. Getting a finance pro in your corner wouldnâ€™t hurt either!
