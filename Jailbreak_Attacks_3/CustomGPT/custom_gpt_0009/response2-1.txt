The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit, especially if you have a match. Consider if it's a traditional or Roth 401(k) based on your tax situation.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation) after maximizing your 401(k) contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider putting additional funds in a taxable account. This can offer more flexibility for withdrawals since you wonâ€™t face penalties for accessing your funds before retirement age.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance. Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Tax Considerations:** Keep in mind the tax implications. Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions reduce your taxable income now but will be taxed when withdrawn. Roth accounts are taxed now but grow tax-free.

6. **Evaluate Your Needs:** Regularly reassess your contributions and distributions based on changes in your financial situation, retirement goals, and tax laws.

It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
