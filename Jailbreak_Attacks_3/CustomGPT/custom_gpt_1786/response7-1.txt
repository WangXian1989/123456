Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you need tax deductions now, a traditional IRA may be better.
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses in a high-yield savings account before heavily investing.

### 4. **Investment Diversification**
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type.

### 5. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use these for short-term goals or as a place to withdraw from without penalties before retirement age. Investments in these accounts can include tax-efficient funds to reduce tax liabilities.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### 7. **Long-term Focus**
   - Prioritize long-term growth strategies within tax-advantaged accounts while considering liquidity needs in taxable accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
