Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Offers tax-deductible contributions, with taxes paid on withdrawals in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider a Roth if you anticipate higher taxes in the future.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you know the annual contribution limits for IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals.
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: Be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains. For long-term investments, holding assets for over a year can reduce capital gains tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - Consider holding more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)s and IRAs) and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Overall Strategy**:
   - Prioritize funding the account that provides the most immediate financial benefit (e.g., employer match).
   - Balance your contributions based on your financial goals, age, and retirement timeline.
   - Regularly re-evaluate your distribution strategy as your circumstances change.
