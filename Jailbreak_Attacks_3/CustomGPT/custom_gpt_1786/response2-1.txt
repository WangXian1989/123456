The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general considerations:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution Strategy**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider maximizing contributions to an IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for each account type.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for goals that are shorter-term or that might require liquidity. Consider investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for favorable tax rates.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth. Reserve more stable income-producing assets (like bonds) for taxable accounts.

### 5. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes, regardless of the account type.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.

### 6. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - **Review Distribution**: Regularly review your account balances and investment performance to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - **Personalized Advice**: If you’re unsure about the best approach or how to configure specific investments, a financial advisor can provide tailored guidance.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: 30%
- **Taxable Account**: 20%

#### Final Thoughts
Adjust this distribution based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Regularly revisiting your strategy is essential as your circumstances change.
