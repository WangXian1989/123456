Distributing your money effectively among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Maximize employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Contribute next, especially if you can do a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & Traditional IRA):** Best for high-income years. You'll pay taxes upon withdrawal, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts (Roth IRA):** Great for younger investors, as contributions are taxed upfront, allowing for tax-free withdrawals later on.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Suitable for short-term goals or if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. For instance, you might hold bonds in taxable and stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

### 4. **Rebalancing and Monitoring:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation as needed to stay on track with your goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of income until match maxed.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowed annually.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings, focusing on long-term investment strategies.

### Final Tips:
- Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances. They can provide personalized advice considering your entire financial picture.
