Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits, but check eligibility based on income limits.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax benefits upfront, but you can withdraw anytime without penalties.

3. **Investment Growth Potential**: 
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments with higher growth potential (e.g., stocks) to benefit from compounded tax-free growth.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have liquid savings (not in retirement accounts) to cover emergencies.

5. **Retirement Timeline**: 
   - If retirement is far off, aggressive growth in tax-advantaged accounts is wise.
   - As you approach retirement, consider reallocating to more conservative investments.

6. **Diversification**: Maintain a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering your overall risk tolerance.

7. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for each account type to maximize your investments.

8. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your allocations as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
