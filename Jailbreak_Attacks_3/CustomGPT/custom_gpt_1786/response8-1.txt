To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to accounts with tax advantages:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to balance risk and growth.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate high income (like bonds) to avoid higher taxes, and focus on low-turnover investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider placing higher-growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize their growth without tax penalties.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired asset mix based on risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, plan how you'll withdraw funds efficiently, considering which accounts to tap first based on tax implications.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If your situation is complex, a professional can provide tailored advice based on your unique financial goals.

Consider these strategies based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
