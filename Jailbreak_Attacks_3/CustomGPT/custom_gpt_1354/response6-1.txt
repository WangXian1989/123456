To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Utilize Roth options**: If available, consider contributing to a Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts**: Allocate growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA, where capital gains wonâ€™t be taxed until withdrawal.
   - **Hold income-producing investments in taxable accounts**: Place bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts, as their returns may be taxed at a lower rate than capital gains.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals considering tax implications to minimize your taxable income during retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first if you're in a higher tax bracket.
