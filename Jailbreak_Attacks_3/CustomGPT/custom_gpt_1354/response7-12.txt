I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing liver issues. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. Common treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in severe cases, surgical interventions or liver transplantation, depending on the underlying condition. Managing a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and potentially using supplements or medications can also help. Please see a doctor for accurate diagnosis and treatment plans tailored to your specific situation.
