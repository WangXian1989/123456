To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: First, ensure you're maxing out any employer match available in your 401(k). This is free money and a great way to start building your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before directing excess funds to taxable accounts. The tax benefits can significantly enhance your savings over time. 

3. **Consider Tax Diversification**: A combination of traditional (pre-tax) and Roth (after-tax) accounts can help mitigate your tax burden in retirement. Diversify your tax exposure based on your anticipated retirement income.

4. **Investment Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance, allocate funds in a diversified manner across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within these accounts. Generally, it's advisable to place higher-risk investments in tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) earlier in your investment life.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: When you're in a position to start withdrawing from these accounts, develop a strategy that considers tax implications. Typically, withdrawing from taxable accounts first may provide more tax-efficient access to funds.

Itâ€™s important to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation.
