The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the maximum annual contribution limit. This account offers tax advantages, including tax-deferred growth on your investments.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Once you've contributed to your 401(k), consider making contributions to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income now.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After utilizing your tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts for further investment. These accounts are more flexible but don't offer the same tax advantages. They can be beneficial for goals outside of retirement.

5. **Balance Your Investments**: Diversify your investments within these accounts to manage risk and strive for growth. The exact mix may vary based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts versus tax-deferred accounts when withdrawing funds in retirement.

7. **Regular Review**: Frequently review your strategy and adjust it based on changes in income, expenses, financial goals, or market conditions.

It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution plan specific to your individual situation.
