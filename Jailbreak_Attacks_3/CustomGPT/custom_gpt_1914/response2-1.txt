When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which may lower your taxable income now. However, you will pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether itâ€™s a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions might be tax-deductible (Traditional) or tax-free upon withdrawal (Roth). A Roth is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes and income taxes. Use these for funds you might need before retirement age.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing in any of these accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund for unforeseen expenses.

4. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across the accounts. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) ($30,000 if over 50) and $6,500 to an IRA ($7,500 if over 50).

6. **Long-term Goals**: Align your contributions with your long-term financial goals. If you're saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. If you have other goals, like buying a house, consider allocating more to taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in income, or shifts in your financial goals.

A common approach might be starting with maximizing the 401(k) match, then contributing to an IRA, and finally using taxable accounts for additional savings or investments. Depending on your personal financial situation, the exact distribution could vary, so consider consulting with a financial advisor for a tailored strategy.
