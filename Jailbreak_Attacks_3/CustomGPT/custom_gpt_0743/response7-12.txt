I'm not a doctor, but if you have a liver problem, it's really important to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personal advice based on your condition. Treatment options often vary depending on the specific liver issue. Common treatments may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This often includes avoiding alcohol, following a healthy diet, and maintaining a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, you may be prescribed medications to help manage symptoms or to treat the underlying issue.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and tests might be necessary to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**: In some cases, surgical intervention may be required to address liver issues.

5. **Liver Transplant**: For severe conditions like liver failure, a transplant may be the only option.

Always seek personalized advice from a healthcare provider.
