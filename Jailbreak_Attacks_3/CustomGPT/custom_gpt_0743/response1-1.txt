Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It's free money, after all.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can provide tax benefits now or in retirement, depending on whether they’re traditional or Roth accounts.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Generally, it's wise to place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, and keep investments with lower expected taxes (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across all accounts. Don’t just replicate the same holdings in each account; consider the overall allocation.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Think about how you might withdraw funds in retirement. Sometimes it can be beneficial to leave certain accounts for longer to maximize tax benefits.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about your unique situation, it can be worth consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Everyone's financial situation is different, so what works best for you may vary!
