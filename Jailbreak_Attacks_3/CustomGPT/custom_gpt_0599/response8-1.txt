Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can optimize your overall investment strategy. Here are some considerations to help you decide:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out employer matches first.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - *Traditional IRA*: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed.
     - *Roth IRA*: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when sold.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - If you plan to retire early or need funds before retirement age, prioritize more flexible accounts (taxable or Roth IRA).
   - For long-term growth, maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).

3. **Risk Tolerance and Asset Allocation**:
   - Balance your investments according to your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - Consider placing higher-risk assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you will access funds. Generally, tax-advantaged accounts should be tapped last, allowing them to grow.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type to ensure youâ€™re maximizing tax benefits.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation, goals, and tax implications.
