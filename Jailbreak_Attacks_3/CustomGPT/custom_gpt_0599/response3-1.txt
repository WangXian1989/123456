Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers employer matching, tax-deferred growth, and higher contribution limits. Great for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax advantages as a 401(k) but with lower contribution limits. Can be a Traditional or Roth IRA, impacting tax treatment.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More flexible, but earnings are taxed yearly. Best for short- to medium-term goals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - Start with your **401(k)** especially if your employer offers a match—try to contribute enough to get the full match.
   - Consider maxing out your **IRA** contributions next (Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation).
   - Use any additional funds for your **taxable account** for flexibility and liquidity.

### 3. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) allow your money to grow without immediate tax impact, but withdrawals during retirement will be taxed.
   - Roth accounts (Roth IRA), on the other hand, offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts will require you to pay capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell investments.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that provide qualified dividends or municipal bonds to minimize tax impact.

### 5. **Regular Reassessment:**
   - Review your allocations regularly, especially as your income and financial goals change.
   - Adjust contributions and investments based on market conditions, tax law changes, and personal circumstances.

### 6. **Withdrawals & Strategy:**
   - Plan withdrawal strategies for retirement. Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### Conclusion:
Tailor these strategies based on your situation and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice that considers your full financial picture.
