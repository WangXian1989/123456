Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts can provide tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Consider Tax Bracket**: If you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA might be advantageous, as withdrawals during retirement can be tax-free. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, contributing to a traditional IRA or 401(k) could be beneficial, allowing for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively. This means not putting all your money in one type of asset or sector.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw money during retirement, as this can influence how you distribute your investments now. Having assets in different types of accounts allows for flexibility in managing taxes in retirement.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment allocations and financial goals, adjusting your strategy as necessary based on changes in your life circumstances or market conditions.

It may also be wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
