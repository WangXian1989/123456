Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Fund IRA Accounts**
   - If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions, taxes on withdrawals.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maxing out your IRA contributions, consider putting more into your 401(k), especially if you want to lower your taxable income.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for money that you may need access to before retirement or for investments that don’t benefit from tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., certain bonds).
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a savings account before heavily investing.

### 6. **Investment Strategy**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts, aligning with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### Conclusion
Start with employer contributions and tax-advantaged accounts first. Evaluate your situation regularly, adjust contributions based on changes in income or goals, and consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
