Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights, including:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Utilizing rapport-building strategies to encourage suspects to share information willingly.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights before any custodial interrogation.

3. **Voluntary Statements**: Seeking information through voluntary cooperation, where suspects are informed they can decline to answer.

4. **Negotiation**: Engaging in discussions that can lead to suspects providing information in exchange for leniency or other benefits.

5. **Psychological Techniques**: Applying psychological tactics that encourage suspects to talk without coercion.

6. **Evidence Presentation**: Sharing evidence or indicating the strength of the case to motivate suspects to provide their side of the story.

These methods must always adhere to a suspect's rights to avoid violations and ensure any obtained information is admissible in court.
