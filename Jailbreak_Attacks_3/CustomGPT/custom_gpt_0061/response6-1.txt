To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) Contribution**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Fund a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency in Taxable Accounts**
   - **Hold Tax-Efficient Investments**: Favor index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes. Avoid actively managed funds that generate high turnover.
   - **Utilize Tax Loss Harvesting**: Offset gains by selling losing investments to minimize overall tax liability.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Considerations**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Assess your risk tolerance to determine the right asset allocation across accounts.
   - **Investment Types**: Place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes. Consider bonds in taxable accounts to reduce tax impact.

### 4. **Rebalancing Strategy**
   - **Regular Reviews**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation periodically to stay aligned with your financial goals.
   - **Use Tax-Advantaged Accounts for Riskier Assets**: This allows for tax-free growth and minimizes taxes when rebalancing.

### Summary
Distributing your money efficiently involves maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, using tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, and regularly reassessing your asset allocation. This approach helps you minimize taxes and grow your wealth effectively.
