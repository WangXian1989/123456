I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Common treatment options for liver issues can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly help improve liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and the progression of the disease.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cancer or advanced cirrhosis, surgical options or a liver transplant may be considered.

Again, please seek professional medical advice to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
