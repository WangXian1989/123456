It’s essential to strike a balance that aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months’ worth of living expenses saved in a high-yield savings account for unexpected expenses.

2. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as it’s essentially free money. Max out your contributions if you can, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket.

3. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify and anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, a traditional IRA may be beneficial. Aim for the maximum annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments outside of tax-advantaged accounts, often for goals like buying a house or early retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your age and risk tolerance. Younger investors can take more risks, while those closer to retirement should prioritize capital preservation.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investments and rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.
