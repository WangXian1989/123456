To optimize the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA (both Traditional and Roth if eligible) since they offer tax advantages.

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k) & Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, making it beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Gains are subject to capital gains tax. Holding investments for over a year can qualify you for lower long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Diversification:** Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across these accounts. Depending on your risk tolerance and investment goals, balance the allocation of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Liquidity Needs:** Keep in mind your need for liquidity. Taxable accounts can be more flexible for short-term needs, while retirement accounts are better for long-term growth.

5. **Income Strategy in Retirement:** Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. A withdrawal strategy that considers tax implications can help maximize your retirement income. For instance, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts to manage your tax bracket.

6. **Review and Rebalance:** Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on performance, changes in tax laws, and your financial goals to ensure your strategy remains effective.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
