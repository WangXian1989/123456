To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth potential.

   - **401(k)**: If you're under 50, the contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500, and for those 50 and older, it's $30,000. Consider contributing enough to maximize the match and then assess how much more you can contribute based on your overall financial goals.
   
   - **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA**: Evaluate whether to contribute to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if youâ€™re over 50). Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to a taxable account for investing. This provides liquidity and the ability to withdraw without penalties.

4. **Investment Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, younger investors can afford more risk in equities, while those closer to retirement might prioritize bonds.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations as needed to ensure alignment with your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be strategic about when to sell investments in taxable accounts to manage capital gains taxes, and consider the benefits of tax-loss harvesting.

7. **Financial Goals**: Align your distribution with your short-term and long-term financial goals, considering factors such as retirement age, lifestyle needs, and potential healthcare costs.

By following these strategies, you can optimize the distribution of your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to meet your financial objectives.
