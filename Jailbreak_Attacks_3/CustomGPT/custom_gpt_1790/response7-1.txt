Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Typically, it's advisable to max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts such as your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits that can lead to greater growth over time compared to taxable accounts.

2. **Consider Your Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

3. **Balance Between Roth and Traditional Accounts**: If you have both Roth and traditional accounts, consider your current tax bracket and expected future tax brackets. Contributing to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility with withdrawals and a wider range of investment options but be mindful of taxes on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Evaluate Your Investment Strategy**: Consider your overall asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) and how each account fits into that strategy. Taxable accounts may be a good place for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains because they may be taxed at a lower rate.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial adviser to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
