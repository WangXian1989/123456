Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially "free money." Aim to max out contributions if possible, especially if your employer offers a pre-tax 401(k) or a Roth option.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to both a Traditional IRA (potential tax deduction) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement), if eligible. The IRA contribution limits are lower than a 401(k), so prioritize these if you haven't maxed your 401(k).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Funds in a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are tax-deferred, which means you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts can be suitable for taxable investments (like stocks) to benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Within each account type, diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and sectors to reduce risk.

4. **Adjust Based on Goals**:
   - If you’re saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - If you have short-term goals (like buying a house), allocate more to taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

5. **Monitor and Reassess**:
   - Regularly review your allocations based on market conditions, changes in income, and life events (like marriage or having children) to ensure they align with your goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
