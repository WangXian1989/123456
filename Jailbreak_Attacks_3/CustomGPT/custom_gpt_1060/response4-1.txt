Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** Always contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; this is essentially “free money.”
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions reduce taxable income, which is beneficial if you’re in a high tax bracket.
   - **Investment Options:** Check the available investment options; 401(k)s may have limited choices.

### 2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may also be tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-deferred. This is useful if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, leading to tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is ideal if you expect your tax rate to rise in the future or want to access contributions without penalty.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits for IRAs.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts provide easy access to funds without penalties for early withdrawal.
   - **Tax Implications:** Investments are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding investments long-term to minimize this impact.
   - **Investment Choices:** Typically, these accounts offer the widest variety of investment options compared to retirement accounts.

### **General Distribution Strategy:**
1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k):** Start with maximizing contributions to get any company match.
2. **Contribute to Roth IRA (if eligible):** After maximizing employer match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
3. **Fund Traditional IRA (if necessary):** If income limits don’t allow Roth contributions, focus on a Traditional IRA.
4. **Contribute More to 401(k):** After IRAs, increase contributions to the 401(k), especially if you’re in a high tax bracket.
5. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds you might need access to before retirement or for additional investments not covered by tax-advantaged accounts.

### **Final Tips:**
- **Review Regularly:** Assess your allocations regularly and adjust based on life changes and goals.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personalized advice can help tailor your strategy based on your specific financial situation.

Always consider your personal circumstances and consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
