Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money). Consider maxing out contributions if feasible, as these contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions up front.

### 2. **Consider Your Financial Goals**
   - **Short-Term Goals (1-5 years)**: Use taxable accounts for liquidity and avoid penalties on early withdrawals from retirement accounts.
   - **Long-Term Goals (5+ years)**: Prioritize retirement accounts for their growth potential and tax advantages.

### 3. **Balance Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Place more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free/deferral growth.
   - **Income Needs**: Keep more stable investments in taxable accounts to provide access to funds without penalties.

### 4. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Annually assess and adjust your distribution based on performance, contributions, and changing financial goals.

This strategy should serve you well; however, it’s always advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
