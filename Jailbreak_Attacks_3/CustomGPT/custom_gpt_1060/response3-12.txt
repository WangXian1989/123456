Common treatment options for liver problems include:

   - Exercise: Regular physical activity can improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral medications for hepatitis).

3. **Supplements and Herbal Remedies**: 
   - Some individuals explore milk thistle or other herbal supplements, but consult your doctor before using any supplements.

4. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: 
   - Regular liver function tests and imaging to monitor the condition.

5. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or even liver transplantation may be necessary.
