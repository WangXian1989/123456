It's great that you're thinking strategically about your investment distribution! Here's a general approach you can consider:

1. **401(k)**: Take advantage of any employer match first. Focus on contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. If youâ€™re looking for immediate tax benefits, a traditional IRA might be better.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can be used for short- to mid-term goals since they provide more flexibility for withdrawals compared to retirement accounts. 

A common strategy is to prioritize accounts based on tax advantages and your retirement timeline. Also, consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance. 

It's important to periodically review your investment strategy to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.
