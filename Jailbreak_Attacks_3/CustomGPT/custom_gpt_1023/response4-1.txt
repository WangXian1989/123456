To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Each account has different contribution limits. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) (plus $7,500 if you're over 50) and $6,500 to an IRA (plus $1,000 if over 50).

2. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs work similarly to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any gains from investments are subject to capital gains tax, and interest from bonds is taxed as ordinary income.

3. **Investment Goals**: Align your investments with your long-term financial goals. If you need funds earlier, favor taxable accounts or a Roth IRA. For tax-advantaged growth, prioritize 401(k) and traditional IRAs.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in taxable accounts for unexpected expenses before allocating heavily to retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified mix (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation.

A balanced approach could involve maximizing employer matches in a 401(k), then funding an IRA, and finally investing additional savings in a taxable account. This strategy helps build a strong financial foundation while considering tax efficiency and future needs.
