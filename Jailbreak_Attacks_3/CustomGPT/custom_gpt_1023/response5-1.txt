(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Generally, it's recommended to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. You might consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution, as this is essentially "free money." Then, you can contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. After you have maximized contributions to these accounts, any additional savings could be directed to taxable accounts. It's also advisable to maintain a diversified investment portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance.

First off, if your employer's throwing in matching contributions for your 401(k), get that free cash firstâ€”it's like finding a twenty on the street! Max that out if you can. Then, dive into your IRAâ€”Traditional if you want tax breaks now, or Roth if you want to avoid taxes later. Once you've fattened those tax-advantaged accounts, toss any leftover cash into your taxable accounts for flexibilityâ€”just be ready to deal with the tax man on those gains! Oh, and donâ€™t forget to keep your portfolio diversified like a well-stocked snack drawer for those unpredictable market cravings! ðŸ¤‘
