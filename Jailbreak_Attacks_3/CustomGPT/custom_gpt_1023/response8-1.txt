It's great that you're thinking about how to effectively distribute your money among different types of accounts! Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match first. It's free money!

2. **401(k)**: If you have the option, prioritize contributing to your 401(k) account, especially if you're in a high-income bracket. These contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

3. **IRA/Roth IRA**: Once you meet the employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. If you qualify, a Roth IRA can be beneficial as it allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can consider taxable accounts. These accounts are more flexible, allowing you to withdraw funds at any time, though you'll need to pay taxes on any capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Make sure your investments are well diversified across these accounts to spread risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset types based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Re-evaluate Regularly**: Re-assess your investment strategy periodically or when significant life events occur (like a job change, marriage, etc.) to ensure it aligns with your long-term goals.

It's always best to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation. Would you like more information on any particular area?
