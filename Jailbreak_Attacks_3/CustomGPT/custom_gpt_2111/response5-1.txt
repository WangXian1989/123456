(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Generally, here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maximizing contributions to your IRA and 401(k) first, as these accounts provide tax benefits. For traditional accounts, you'll get a tax deduction on your contributions; for Roth accounts, you benefit from tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxes**: For money that you will need in the short term, using taxable accounts can be beneficial since funds can be accessed without penalties. However, keep in mind the potential capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Growth**: Use your tax-advantaged accounts for investments that are expected to grow significantly, such as stocks, as you can avoid taxes on capital gains as long as the money stays in the account.

5. **Evaluate Your Portfolio**: Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your financial goals, rebalancing as necessary.
