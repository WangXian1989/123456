Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. IRAs often have a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA can give you tax deductions now.

3. **Pay Attention to Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), you’ll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider using these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, as these can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**: If you're further away from retirement, you may be able to take more risks with investments in taxable accounts for potentially higher growth. As you get closer to retirement, shifting towards more stable, less risky investments can be prudent.

5. **Emergency Fund First**: Make sure you have an adequate emergency fund before aggressively funding retirement accounts. Generally, an emergency fund should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation in each account based on performance and any changes to your goals or risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure or have a complex financial situation, it can be beneficial to consult a financial advisor who can give you personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, the best distribution will vary greatly among individuals based on their financial situation and goals.
