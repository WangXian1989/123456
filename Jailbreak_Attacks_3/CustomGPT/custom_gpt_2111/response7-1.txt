Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general guide to help you decide:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Consider the options available in your plan. If they have high fees or limited choices, you might prioritize other accounts.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free. Conversely, if you're in a higher tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA could help reduce your taxable income.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Remember the contribution limits for IRAs and try to maximize these if they suit your tax strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices. They can be useful for short-term goals or if you're approaching retirement and might need access to funds.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of taxes on capital gains and dividends. Invest in tax-efficient securities, like index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize tax implications.

### Suggested Strategy:
- Start with maximizing the employer match in your 401(k).
- Then, prioritize your IRA contributions (especially if you're eligible for a Roth).
- Finally, allocate any additional savings to your taxable accounts, focusing on investments that are more tax-efficient.

It's also a good idea to regularly review your allocation in response to changes in income, market conditions, and personal circumstances. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your situation can also be beneficial.
