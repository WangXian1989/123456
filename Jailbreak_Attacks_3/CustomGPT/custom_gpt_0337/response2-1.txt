Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **IRA Contribution:** If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA as it offers tax advantages (traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals).

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, allocate funds to a taxable account for more flexibility. This account isn’t subject to the same withdrawal penalties and has no contribution limits.

4. **Consider Tax Implications:** 
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term investments to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - In a taxable account, focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy based on your individual circumstances.

This balanced approach can help you make the most of your investments over time.
