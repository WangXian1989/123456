To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Maximize contributions up to the limit ($6,500 in 2023, or $7,500 if you're over 50).

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions reduce taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they're realized.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k):** Generally, opt for a diversified mix of index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA:** Choose investments with long-term growth potential. Consider individual stocks or funds that align with your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liability.

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months' worth of living expenses saved in an easily accessible account before heavily investing.

### 5. **Regular Reviews:**
   - Monitor your portfolios periodically and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial goals or market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized strategies based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.

By distributing funds strategically, you can optimize growth while managing tax liabilities effectively.
