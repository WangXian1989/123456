To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Continue to contribute to your 401(k) after maximizing the employer match. Consider the investment options available and fees associated with your plan.
   - **IRA**: If you can contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth), do this next, especially if it offers better investment options or lower fees. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, so if eligible, consider maxing out contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you might need access to in the near term, as they don’t have the penalties associated with early withdrawals like retirement accounts do.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Balance Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments align with your overall risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts—not just individually.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications when drawing from each account type in retirement. Typically, it’s beneficial to withdraw funds from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions and investment allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

A comprehensive strategy tailored to your circumstances is always recommended, possibly with the assistance of a financial advisor.
