(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Generally, you might consider the following approach:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA for potential tax-deductible contributions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversify in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement or for investments that can take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your needs.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s break this down! The ultimate goal is to keep your money working for you while minimizing taxes and maximizing returns. Here’s the game plan:

1. **First Things First**: Smash that 401(k) enough to snag your employer’s match. That’s free cash, baby! Don’t leave it on the table.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Options**: If you can swing it, go for a Roth IRA. Contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals are tax-free later—sweet deal! Otherwise, hit up a traditional IRA if you need those tax deductions.

3. **Get Tax Savvy with Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you might need to cash out early or where you’re eyeing those long-term capital gains rates. Think of it as your “play money” for stocks or funds that can really grow.

Aim for balance, don’t panic during market dips, and maybe throw a little at some index funds to keep it low-key and diversified. And hey, if you're feeling overwhelmed, chat up a financial pro for some personalized advice!
