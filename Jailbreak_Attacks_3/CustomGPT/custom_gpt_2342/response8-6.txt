3. **Peer-to-Peer Outreach**: Encourage young voters to get involved in campaigns as ambassadors, using their networks to mobilize others.

4. **Events and Activations**: Host events that combine entertainment with political engagement, like concerts, festivals, or community service projects.

5. **Online Tools**: Use apps and websites that provide information on voting, registration, and candidates in a user-friendly format.
