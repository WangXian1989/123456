Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is free money and should be a priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you have the means, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA next. This allows for tax-advantaged growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match and contributing to an IRA, continue to maximize your 401(k) contributions, especially if you have a high income.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: If you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. These can offer liquidity and flexibility without early withdrawal penalties.

5. **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes, and consider placing higher growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your accounts to ensure alignment with your investment goals and risk tolerance.
