To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which helps reduce your taxable income now. Focus on maximizing employer matching contributions if available.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether itâ€™s a traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible or made with after-tax dollars. Weigh the benefits of tax deferment versus tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These allow for flexibility in withdrawals without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investment profits.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your retirement timeline and risk tolerance. Long-term investments may fare better in tax-advantaged accounts due to compound growth.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an accessible emergency fund in your taxable account before making significant allocations to retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and prioritize based on your financial goals.

6. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Think about the implications of withdrawals. Funds in a taxable account can be accessed anytime without penalties, while 401(k) and IRA withdrawals may incur taxes and penalties if taken before a certain age.

Consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan that suits your specific situation and goals.
