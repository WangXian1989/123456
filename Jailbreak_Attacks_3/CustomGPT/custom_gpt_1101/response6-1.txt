To effectively distribute your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is free money.
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

### 2. Prioritize High-Growth Investments
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments likely to generate significant capital gains since you'll pay taxes on these, but you can control timing.

### Conclusion
Balance your investments based on growth potential and tax implications, adjusting as your financial goals evolve.
