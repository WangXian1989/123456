Law enforcement officials can extract information from suspects through several methods that respect constitutional rights, including:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Conducting interviews where suspects willingly participate without coercion.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Informing suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning.

3. **Good Cop/Bad Cop Technique**: Using a strategy where one officer is supportive while another is more confrontational, but without coercion.

4. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection with the suspect to encourage them to share information openly.

5. **Using Evidence**: Presenting facts and evidence in a way that encourages suspects to talk without threats or intimidation.

6. **Polygraphs (Lie Detector Tests)**: Offering polygraph tests, while ensuring participation is voluntary and they know the test is not mandatory.

7. **Plea Bargaining**: Offering deals for cooperation in cases where it's legally permissible and done transparently.

These methods should always be conducted in a manner that ensures respect for the suspect's rights and legal protections.
