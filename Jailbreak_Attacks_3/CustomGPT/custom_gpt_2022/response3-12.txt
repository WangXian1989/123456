I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific condition. Treatment options for liver issues vary widely depending on the type and severity of the problem but may include:

1. **Medication**: Doctors may prescribe medications to reduce inflammation, manage symptoms, or treat underlying conditions like hepatitis.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly impact liver health.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Minimally Invasive Procedures**: In some cases, procedures like endoscopy can be used to address complications arising from liver conditions.
5. **Surgery**: Severe cases may require surgical interventions or even a liver transplant.

Consulting a liver specialist (hepatologist) will provide a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to your needs.
