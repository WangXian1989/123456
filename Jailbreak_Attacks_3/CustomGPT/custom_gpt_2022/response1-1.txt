Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here's a simplified approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, especially with a matching contribution, prioritize this to take full advantage of the match. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as that's essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maxing out the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your tax preference. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've contributed to your 401(k) and IRA, you can consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility since you can withdraw money without penalties, but they're subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Make sure to diversify your investments across these accounts. Have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to manage risk.

5. **Consideration of Taxes**: Understand the tax implications of each type of account. For example, traditional accounts provide tax deferral, whereas withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Keep in mind that before heavily investing in these accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund in place to cover unexpected expenses.

7. **Revisit Annually**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio allocations based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

It's always good to consult with a financial advisor to develop a strategy tailored to your unique circumstances.
