To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Aim to max out your contributions to both your 401(k) and IRA if possible. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs, with catch-up contributions available if you’re over 50.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can start contributing to taxable accounts. These provide flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices, though you'll need to pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Invest aggressively in accounts intended for long-term growth (like your 401(k) and IRA) and consider a more conservative approach in taxable accounts to manage taxes effectively on any short-term gains.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investment allocations across all accounts to ensure you're aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re uncertain about your allocation strategy, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your financial situation.

By following these steps, you can optimize your investment distribution across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively.
