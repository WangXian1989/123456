(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Generally, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. It's essentially ‚Äúfree money.‚Äù

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After taking full advantage of your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth. Depending on your income, you may qualify for a deductible traditional IRA or a Roth IRA.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: If you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can then focus on taxable accounts. These can offer more flexibility and liquidity as they don't have the same withdrawal restrictions as retirement accounts.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxes can impact your investment returns, so consider holding different types of investments in different accounts. For instance, it's often beneficial to hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in a taxable account and higher-tax investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as needed based on your changing financial situation, market conditions, and retirement timeline.

Consulting with a financial advisor can offer tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
