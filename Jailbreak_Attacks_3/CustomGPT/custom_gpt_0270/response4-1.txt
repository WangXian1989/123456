To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to your employer's 401(k), especially if they offer a matching contribution. This account grows tax-deferred, which can be beneficial for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you meet conditions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate tax-efficient income (like index funds). Consider holding short-term investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Match your investment choices with your risk tolerance and timeline. For retirement accounts, you might take a more aggressive approach, while taxable accounts could be more conservative.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio within each account type to spread risk. Balance equities, bonds, and other assets according to your long-term goals.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, have a strategy for withdrawals: consider drawing from taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer, focusing on tax implications with each withdrawal.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.
