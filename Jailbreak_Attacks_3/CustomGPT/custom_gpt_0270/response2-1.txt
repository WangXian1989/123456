Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maximizing contributions to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your income level and tax strategy.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts for more flexibility and access.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - For tax-advantaged accounts, you may hold higher-growth investments since withdrawals are taxed upon retirement.
   - In taxable accounts, consider more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio as your financial situation and goals evolve.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can tailor advice to your unique situation.

This balanced strategy helps maximize growth while considering taxes and liquidity.
