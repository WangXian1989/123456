Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match firstâ€”it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then consider maxing out your IRA.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate taxable income (like bonds) to keep your tax-advantaged accounts focused on long-term growth.
   - Consider leveraging tax-loss harvesting in your taxable accounts when appropriate.

4. **Balance Risk and Diversification**: 
   - Ensure that your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - Be mindful of the impact of different account types on your overall tax liability.

5. **Focus on Time Horizons**:
   - If you have short-term needs, keep more money in taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - For long-term goals, maximize contributions to retirement accounts.

6. **Regularly Reassess**: Review your allocation periodically based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
