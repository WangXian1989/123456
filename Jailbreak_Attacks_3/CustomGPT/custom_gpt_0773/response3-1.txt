Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves understanding your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.” Then, aim to contribute the maximum allowed if it fits your budget.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Focus on Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider your age, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Generally, younger investors might prioritize growth through stocks, while those closer to retirement may lean towards bonds or more conservative investments.

3. **Tax-Efficient Investing**:
   - Hold investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer or avoid taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with favorable tax treatment, such as index funds or long-term stock investments, to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Aim for a diversified portfolio within each account type. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments based on your risk profile.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially after significant market movements.

6. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these investment accounts for unexpected expenses to avoid penalties for early withdrawals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If your situation is complex or you're unsure, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy.

Adjust your contributions and allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and life events such as marriage, career changes, or nearing retirement.
