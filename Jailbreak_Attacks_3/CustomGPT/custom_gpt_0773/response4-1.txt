Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Depending on your plan, you might have an option for a Roth 401(k), where contributions are made after-tax.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRA contributions may also be tax-deductible. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars, which can be beneficial in retirement.

3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before distributing funds to investments, consider paying off high-interest debts, as the interest on these can outweigh investment returns.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in a taxable account to cover 3-6 months of expenses for unforeseen circumstances.

6. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: As you get closer to retirement, you may want to shift towards more conservative investments. 

7. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can be more flexible, allowing you to withdraw funds without penalties, making them suitable for shorter-term goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your situation.

This distribution strategy can vary widely based on individual circumstances, so tailor these recommendations to your specific financial goals and needs.
