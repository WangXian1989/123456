Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on a 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match first—this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you still have funds after maxing out your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k). This account allows higher contribution limits than IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once your tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out, you can invest in taxable accounts. This can include stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when withdrawing from taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) to manage risk effectively.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you’re younger, you might want to take on more risk with stocks, but if you’re closer to retirement, consider more stable investments.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to keep your asset allocation in line with your goals.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan according to your personal financial situation.
