Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k)**: Max out any employer match first, as it's effectively free money. Then, consider contributing up to the annual limit if you have a high-income potential in the future, as 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute to an IRA depending on your tax situation. A Traditional IRA might be better if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, while a Roth IRA can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher bracket later on. Use the annual contribution limits to guide your contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you’ve maximized your tax-advantaged accounts. This can include any money you might need access to before retirement or for short- to medium-term goals. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Strategy Tips:
- **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts while holding lower-growth assets in your taxable accounts to minimize taxes.
- **Reassess Regularly**: As your financial situation and goals evolve, adjust your allocations accordingly.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances is often advisable.
