Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is great for tax-free growth if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Max Out the 401(k)**: After your IRA contributions, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions, especially if you are in your peak earning years. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings and goals beyond retirement. This approach provides flexibility and liquidity.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider having a diversified mix of investments in each account type, aligning with your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

6. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind the tax implications of each account type. For example, place highly taxed investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

7. **Regularly Review**: Periodically reassess your investments and contributions based on your financial situation and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
