Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: After securing the match, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions (up to the annual limit) for tax benefits, especially if you have a traditional 401(k) that offers pre-tax contributions.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions upfront.

3. **Consider Roth Conversions**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, you might consider contributing to a Roth IRA or converting some Traditional IRA funds to Roth to take advantage of tax-free growth.

4. **Funding Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, fund a taxable investment account. This offers flexibility, as you can withdraw funds without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to minimize risk.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Periodically evaluate your distribution strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored strategies based on your specific circumstances.
