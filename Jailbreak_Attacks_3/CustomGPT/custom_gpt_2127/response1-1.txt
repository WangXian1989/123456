The optimal way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), either a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and eligibility. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, distributions in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This provides more flexibility for withdrawals and investments, but keep in mind that you'll owe capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell investments.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Regardless of the account type, ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. This may include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Make sure to periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement strategies.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy based on your specific circumstances.
