To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Current Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower tax liabilities or when you need accessible funds before retirement.
   - **Capital Gains Management:** Consider holding assets in taxable accounts for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Maintain a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations to stay in line with your investment goals.

By following these strategies, you can effectively optimize the growth of your investments while managing your tax implications.
