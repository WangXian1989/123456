When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you'll want to take into account several factors, including tax implications, liquidity needs, investment goals, and retirement planning strategies. Here are some general steps to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts such as your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to your 401(k) and up to $6,500 to your IRA (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution if you're over 50).

3. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**: If you have both a Roth IRA and traditional accounts, think about your tax situation. Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for investments. This provides more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, and you may be able to benefit from favorable capital gains tax rates.

5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals. Keep in mind that certain investments may perform better in tax-advantaged accounts versus taxable accounts (e.g., bonds may produce interest that is best kept in tax-deferred accounts).

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions across all accounts to ensure they align with your financial goals. Rebalancing may be necessary to maintain your desired risk level as markets fluctuate.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: If you're unsure about the best distribution strategy for your situation, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and effective distribution strategy for your retirement savings.
