Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, ensure you're contributing enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income. Consider prioritizing your 401(k) contributions if you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Consider whether a traditional or Roth IRA suits your needs. With a traditional IRA, you may receive a tax deduction on contributions, while withdrawals in retirement are taxed. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals but require after-tax contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should be used for investments you'll need access to before retirement. Capital gains and dividends are taxed annually, so consider holding lower-turnover investments here.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time until retirement. Equities may be suitable for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while fixed-income investments can be more suitable for taxable accounts to minimize immediate tax impact.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a separate emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy to adapt to changes in income, tax law, and your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor familiar with retirement planning can provide tailored advice based on your unique circumstances.
