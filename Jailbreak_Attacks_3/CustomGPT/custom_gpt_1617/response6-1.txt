To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible or not, influencing future tax treatment.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed on capital gains and dividends, which can impact after-tax returns.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-term Growth**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for compound growth.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Maintain an appropriate cash reserve in taxable accounts for short-term needs and emergencies.

### 3. **Contribution Strategy**
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match first, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Diversify Contributions**: After maxing the company match, consider funding an IRA to further reduce tax liability and maximize retirement savings.

### 4. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - **Monitor Asset Allocation**: Ensure your risk tolerance and investment goals are met across all accounts. Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired allocation.
   - **Adjust Contributions**: As income changes or retirement approaches, adjust contributions accordingly.

### 5. **Considerations for Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement strategically to minimize tax burden, potentially drawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings while maintaining liquidity in taxable accounts, you can optimize your overall financial strategy. It’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and financial goals.
