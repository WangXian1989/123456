Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here’s a general framework to help you decide:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limit:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits ($22,500 for individuals under 50 as of 2024, with a $7,500 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older).
   - **Investment Options:** Consider the investment options and fees associated with your 401(k).

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
   - **Tax Treatment:** Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions but taxed upon withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (contributions are taxed, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement).
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be mindful of annual contribution limits ($6,500 for individuals under 50, with a $1,000 catch-up for those 50 and older).
   - **Flexibility:** IRAs typically offer more investment choices compared to a 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Use taxable accounts for investments that you may want to access before retirement or that don’t qualify for tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes and consider investments that are more tax-efficient (e.g., index funds, ETFs).
   - **Goal-Specific Investing:** This can also be a good vehicle for non-retirement goals, such as buying a house or funding an education.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out your 401(k) match** first, then direct additional contributions into an IRA if you can afford it.
- Depending on your retirement timeline and needs, consider allocating funds into these accounts that reflect your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
- Once you're maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating excess funds to a taxable account for more flexible investing options.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** Aim for 15-25% of your income until you hit maximum contributions or the employer match.
- **IRA:** After getting the employer match, put 10-15% into IRA accounts.
- **Taxable Account:** Any additional funds can be allocated here, focusing on your specific goals and liquidity needs.

Always consult with a financial advisor tailored to your personal scenario to ensure that you’re making the best choices for your individual circumstances.
