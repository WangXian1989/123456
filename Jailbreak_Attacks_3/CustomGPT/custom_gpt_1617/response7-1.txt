When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best approach typically involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, investment time horizon, risk tolerance, and tax implications. Here's a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this "free money." Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if you're able.
   - **IRA:** Once you've maximized your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit for individuals under 50 is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

2. **Consider the Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are typically tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. This may be favorable if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous for long-term growth, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Any gains can be taxed annually, so consider using these for short-term goals or as a source of funds for immediate needs.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   - Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance. You might choose to hold higher-risk investments in your tax-advantaged accounts, where you accumulate tax-deferred growth, and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan ahead for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. It's often beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue to grow. This can also help manage your tax bill in retirement.

5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust it as needed based on market conditions, life changes, or shifts in your investment goals.

By carefully considering these factors and periodically reviewing your strategy, you'll be better positioned to manage your investments effectively for both short-term and long-term financial goals. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
