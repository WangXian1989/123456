(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly valuable as they allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out retirement accounts, consider putting surplus funds into taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for investments and withdrawals, though you will pay taxes on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your asset allocation is diversified across both retirement and taxable accounts to balance risk and returns.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax consequences of selling investments in your taxable accounts, as these could influence your overall strategy.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! When it comes to distributing your cash among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s all about maximizing your benefits while keeping it flexible for the future.

1. **Go Hard on the 401(k)**: For starters, you want to pump as much as you can into that 401(k) to snag your employerâ€™s match. Itâ€™s like a bonus you didnâ€™t even ask for! 

2. **Hit Up the IRA Next**: Once youâ€™re good with the 401(k), max out that IRA. If you can swing a Roth IRA, do it! Tax-free growth is like finding money in the couch cushions, but for your future.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Extra Freedom**: After the retirement accounts, throw any excess into taxable accounts. They give you more liquidity and you wonâ€™t be hit with that pesky early withdrawal penalty. Just keep an eye on the tax bill from those gains!

4. **Spread Your Bets**: Mix your investments so youâ€™re not just all in on one type of asset. Spread that money around to manage your risks and returns.

5. **Stay Tax Aware**: Keep track of whatâ€™s taxable and whatâ€™s not. It can save you a headache and help you keep more of your hard-earned cash.

In short, get as much free money as you can from your employer, stow away for retirement, and keep a healthy stash that you can access without waiting until youâ€™re old and gray!
