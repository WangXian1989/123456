Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should align with your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize maximizing your contributions to at least the match amount. This is essentially "free" money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limit for 401(k)s is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), while IRAs have a limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Strategic Withdrawals**:
   - In retirement, consider the order of withdrawals: typically, it's advised to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: 
   - Contributions to 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs reduce your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this can be advantageous.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Keep a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all account types. Different tax treatments can affect how you allocate riskier investments.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Investments and tax situations change, so review your distribution strategy annually to adjust for changes in income, life circumstances, or financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Adviser**:
   - Individual circumstances vary, so working with a financial professional can provide personalized strategies that align with your specific goals.

By focusing on these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money to optimize growth and tax efficiency.
