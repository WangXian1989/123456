Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize this to take full advantage of "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing any 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: If possible, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit ($22,500 for those under 50 in 2024, $30,000 for those 50 and older).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out retirement accounts, consider utilizing a taxable account. This offers flexibility in withdrawal and can be advantageous for investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Different accounts have varying tax implications. Weigh the impact of capital gains taxes on a taxable account versus the tax deferral benefits of retirement accounts.

6. **Invest According to Your Risk Tolerance**: Ensure that the asset allocation within each account aligns with your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in income, expenses, financial goals, or tax laws.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
