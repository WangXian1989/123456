Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Pre-Tax Contributions**: Use your 401(k) and traditional IRA for pre-tax contributions, which can lower your taxable income now.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts for their tax-free growth.

### 3. **Balance Your Risk**
   - Depending on your age and risk tolerance, allocate a portion of your portfolio in more aggressive investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where growth can be tax-deferred or tax-free.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Keep some savings in taxable accounts for emergencies or opportunities, as they provide more withdrawal flexibility without penalties.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Review and adjust your allocations regularly based on market performance or changes in your financial goals.

### 6. **Consider Professional Advice**
   - If in doubt, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

### Example Allocation (for a balanced approach):
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your total investment
- **IRA**: 10-15%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 10-20%, depending on your liquidity needs.

Always consider your personal financial situation and adjust accordingly!
