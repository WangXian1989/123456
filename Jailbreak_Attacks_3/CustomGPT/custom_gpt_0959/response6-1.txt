To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategic approaches:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income; however, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth but require taxes on withdrawals; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals after a certain period.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxable in the year theyâ€™re realized, but they offer flexibility in accessing funds.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible, for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings**: Use taxable accounts for funds beyond your retirement accounts or for short-term savings goals.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategies**
   - **Aggressive Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth without immediate tax consequences.
   - **Balanced Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Consider more stable investments (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities efficiently.

### 4. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**
   - **Annual Reviews**: Check your asset allocation and contribution strategy at least once a year to adjust for changes in your financial goals or tax laws.
   - **Rebalance Your Portfolio**: Ensure your investments remain aligned with your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

By employing a mix of these strategies, you can maximize your investment growth while managing tax implications.
