Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of itâ€”it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Good for tax-deferred growth; contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, beneficial if you expect your tax rate to rise.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for more flexible investment options and liquidity. This is especially useful for investment strategies that might generate taxable income (like dividends or short-term capital gains). 

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account type. Generally, higher-growth assets (like stocks) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while lower-growth, taxable income assets (like bonds) might be better in taxable accounts due to tax treatment.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Understand that dividends and capital gains in taxable accounts will be taxed differently than the tax-deferred growth in retirement accounts. 

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations annually or with significant life changes to ensure they still align with your goals.

It's beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
