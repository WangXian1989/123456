To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal, usually at retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), either Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes on profits, but they offer flexibility and no contribution limits.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize your tax-advantaged savings.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your goals (short-term vs. long-term). Taxable accounts can be better for near-term needs or investments needing liquidity.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, taking into account the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Asset Location**:
   - Generally, place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and more tax-efficient investments (like municipal bonds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals considering tax implications. Typically, withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed as regular income.

7. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on your changing financial situation, market conditions, or new tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy that works specifically for your financial situation.
