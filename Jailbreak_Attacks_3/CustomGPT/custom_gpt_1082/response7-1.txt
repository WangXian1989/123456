Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA.

### 2. **Investment Choices:**
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider holding higher-yield investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 3. **Assess Your Time Horizon:**
   - If you are saving for retirement, prioritize the 401(k) and IRA due to their tax advantages.
   - For shorter-term goals, utilize taxable accounts where you can access funds more easily without penalties.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Ensure your asset allocation reflects your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio that meets your investment goals.

### 5. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Keep track of your overall tax situation. Withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) or IRA are taxed as income, while investments in a taxable account may be subject to capital gains taxes.

### Example Distribution Plan:
- **401(k):** Contribute 15% up to the match limit.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowed.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest any additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Regular Review:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your contributions and allocations as your financial situation changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique circumstances.
