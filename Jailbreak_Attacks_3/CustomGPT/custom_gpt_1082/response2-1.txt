Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you have excess funds after getting the match, consider funding your IRA. Choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals, if conditions are met).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA):** Generally beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Dividends and gains are taxed annually, but they offer flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - **Time Horizon:** Longer time horizons can afford more risk, particularly in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid penalties for early withdrawals.

### 5. **Periodic Review and Rebalance**
   - Regularly review your investment allocations and rebalance as needed to maintain your risk profile and meet your goals.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** 20-30% of your total investment funds, ensuring max contribution up to the match.
- **IRA:** 10-20% depending on your tax strategies and whether you choose traditional or Roth.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate remaining funds (30-50%), focusing on long-term investments and tax efficiency.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your unique circumstances.
