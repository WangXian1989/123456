The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income.
- **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.
- **Investment Options**: Typically limited to the options provided by the plan.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Tax Treatment**: Traditional IRAs may give you tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Contribution Limits**: Lower than 401(k) limits; ensure you’re within those limits.
- **Flexibility**: More investment choices compared to a 401(k).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Liquidity**: Offers easy access to your funds without penalties.
- **Tax Implications**: You’ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains; tax-loss harvesting can help mitigate this.
- **Investment Strategy**: Ideal for short-term goals or a diversified mix of investments.

### **Distribution Strategy**
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Focus on maxing out your 401(k) to get any employer match first, then consider your IRA for tax benefits.
- **Balance Tax Implications**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth but keep cash needs in taxable accounts.
- **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, prioritize Roth options. If you’re in your peak earning years, a traditional 401(k) or IRA may be more beneficial.
- **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and adjust your allocations regularly based on performance and life changes.

### **Consult a Professional**
Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that aligns with your specific circumstances and goals.
