Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax which can reduce your taxable income now, but you will pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, deferring taxes until withdrawal. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Youâ€™ll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains annually. They offer more flexibility as you can withdraw money anytime without penalty.

3. **Retirement Goals**: If retirement is several decades away, your focus can be on growth, potentially favoring tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account, ensure you have a diversified investment strategy tailored to your risk tolerance.

6. **Current Needs vs Future Goals**: Balance your contributions based on your current financial needs and future retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Planner**: Consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.

Overall, a balanced approach often includes maximizing your 401(k) contributions, contributing to IRAs (especially Roth for tax-free growth), and using taxable accounts for flexibility and more immediate needs.
