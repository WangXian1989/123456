(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and investment preferences. Generally, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially ‚Äúfree money.‚Äù
2. **Utilize Tax Advantages**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider fully funding your IRA (Traditional or Roth) since these accounts can offer tax advantages depending on your income and tax bracket.
3. **Consider Withdrawal Rules**: Remember the withdrawal rules of each account type. Early withdrawals from retirement accounts typically incur penalties, while taxable accounts offer more flexibility.
4. **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes and consider holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored distribution strategy that fits your specific needs.
