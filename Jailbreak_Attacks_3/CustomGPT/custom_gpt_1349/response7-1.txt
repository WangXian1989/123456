It's important to consider a few factors when distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as it's free money.

2. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts First**: Generally, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can lead to greater growth over time compared to taxable accounts.

   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match first, then consider contributing more if you can.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate dividends or interest, as you won't incur penalties for early withdrawal. These accounts can be beneficial for short-term goals or liquidity needs.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are well-diversified across different asset classes to manage risk.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications for each account typeâ€”tax-deferred for 401(k) and Traditional IRA versus tax-free withdrawals from Roth IRAs.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals can change, so review your strategy periodically to ensure it aligns with your current needs.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation.
