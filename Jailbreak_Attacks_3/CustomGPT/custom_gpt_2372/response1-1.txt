Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. It's essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions if possible, especially if you’re in your peak earning years.
   - **Tax Deferral**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider taking advantage of Roth options if your plan offers it.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deferral, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of contribution limits and deadlines, especially for Roth IRAs based on income levels.
   - **Diverse Options**: You may have more investment choices in an IRA compared to a 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices, but you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Consider holding investments that generate less taxable income (like certain ETFs or tax-managed funds) to minimize tax liability.

### Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with enough contributions to get your full 401(k) match, then consider maxing out your IRA. After that, put additional funds in the 401(k).
- **Consider Diversification**: Aim for diversification across all accounts to manage risk. 
- **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.

Lastly, it’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.
