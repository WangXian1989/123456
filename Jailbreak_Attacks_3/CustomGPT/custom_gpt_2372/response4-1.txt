Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general steps you might consider:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Each account type has its own contribution limits. Make sure you're aware of these limits (e.g., the IRS limits for 401(k)s and IRAs).

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, given certain conditions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Since contributions are made with after-tax dollars, you’ll owe taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all account types to reduce risk.

5. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Younger investors may opt for a higher allocation in stocks, while those closer to retirement may shift towards bonds to preserve capital.

6. **Liquidity Needs**: Consider how much you’ll need to access money in the short term. Taxable accounts allow for easier withdrawal without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: Over time, investments can drift from their intended allocation, so it’s important to review and adjust periodically.

8. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Before making significant financial decisions, a professional can provide guidance tailored to your unique situation.

This approach can help you allocate your funds effectively while considering your specific needs and goals.
