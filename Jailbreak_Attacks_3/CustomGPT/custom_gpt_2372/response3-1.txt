Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, time horizon, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider for each type of account:

1. **401(k) Plan:**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Since contributions are made with pre-tax dollars (for traditional 401(k)s), this can lower your taxable income.
   - **Investment Options**: Make sure to review the investment options available within your 401(k) and select funds that align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
  
2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for IRAs. Consider a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversification**: Use your IRA for different assets that may not be available in a 401(k) such as individual stocks or specific funds.
   - **Long-term Growth**: IRAs are generally geared towards long-term investing, so choosing growth-oriented investments can be beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts provide flexibility and easy access to funds if you need them before retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs that generate minimal capital gains.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Holding investments long-term can reduce the tax impact.

### General Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start by maximizing your employer match in your 401(k), then contribute to an IRA based on your eligibility and tax situation.
- **Balance Investments**: Mix conservative investments in safer accounts (like bonds in a 401(k) or IRA) and more aggressive ones (like stocks in a taxable account) for potential long-term capital growth.
- **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Example Scenario:
- **For a Younger Investor**: You might prioritize maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA for long-term tax-free growth while contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the match and allocating any additional funds to a taxable account.
- **For an Older Investor**: You may lean more heavily on your 401(k) and traditional IRA to take advantage of tax-deferred growth and shift more conservative in your taxable investments.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the approach based on your specific financial circumstances and goals.
