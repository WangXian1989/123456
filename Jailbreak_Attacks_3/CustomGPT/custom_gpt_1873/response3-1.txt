Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is effectively free money and offers immediate returns.

2. **Maximize IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The contribution limits are generally lower than 401(k)s, but IRAs often offer more investment choices.

3. **Tax-Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts grow tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth). Prioritize these for high-growth assets since you wonâ€™t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal (or never, in the case of Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividend income, where tax implications are significant. Think about holding bonds or higher dividend stocks here to manage tax burdens.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - In higher tax brackets, pre-tax contributions to a 401(k) or traditional IRA may be more advantageous. In lower brackets, Roth contributions could be preferable.

5. **Rebalance Based on Age & Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors might focus heavily on growth (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while those nearing retirement could shift to more stable assets (bonds).

6. **Emergency Fund & Debt**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund and prioritize paying off high-interest debt before maximizing retirement accounts.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
