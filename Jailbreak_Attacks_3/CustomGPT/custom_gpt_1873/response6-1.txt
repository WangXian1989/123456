To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. Understand Contribution Limits:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and income levels.

### 2. Tax Considerations:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed upfront, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed in the year they are earned, but capital gains may be deferred until you sell.

### 3. Asset Allocation:
   - **Growth Investments** (stocks): Ideal for tax-advantaged accounts where you want to minimize taxes on capital gains.
   - **Income Investments** (bonds, dividends): Consider placing these in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

### 4. Diversification:
   - Ensure a mix of asset types across all account types to spread risk and enhance returns.

### 5. Withdrawal Strategy:
   - In retirement, plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes, prioritizing tax-deferred accounts first and leaving Roth accounts to grow longer.

Adjust your strategy based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Regularly review your allocations to adapt to changes in market conditions and tax laws.
