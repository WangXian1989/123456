Think TikTok dances about policies, Instagram polls on hot topics, and memes that poke fun at older politicians. Make your message relatable and funny; young folks respond to authenticity and humor. Also, hit them with issues that get them fired up, like climate action, equality, or student loansâ€”itâ€™s all about what they actually care about. Partner up with influencers who they follow, because letâ€™s be honest, if a trend isnâ€™t endorsed by someone they like, itâ€™s dead in the water. And donâ€™t forget to get out there in the real world! Host events, parties, or even cool pop-up shops that let them feel involved and empowered to vote.
