Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax income, allowing for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in this account may be subject to capital gains tax when sold, so consider holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) here.

3. **Determine Your Investment Strategy**:
   - Invest for long-term growth in 401(k) and IRA accounts through a diversified portfolio. 
   - Use taxable accounts for income-generating assets or to invest in strategies where you might need liquidity.

4. **Adjust Based on Life Stages and Goals**:
   - As you age, shift your focus towards less risky investments, especially in your retirement accounts.
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

5. **Consult with a Financial Planner**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your overall financial situation and help optimize your investment strategy.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts while considering your goals and investment horizon, you can create a well-rounded investment approach.
