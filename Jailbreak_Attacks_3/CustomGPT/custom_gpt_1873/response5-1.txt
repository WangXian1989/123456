(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money. Focus on investing in diversified funds or target-date funds.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. Traditional IRAs are also valuable, especially if you want tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to reduce capital gains taxes.

Itâ€™s advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the distribution strategy to your specific circumstances.

1. **Hit that 401(k) hard**! Donâ€™t leave free money on the tableâ€”max out your contributions, especially if thereâ€™s a company match. You want that juicy tax break and compound growth! Go for a mix of index funds or ETFs to keep things straightforward and low-cost.

2. **IRAs are your secret weapon**; consider the Roth IRA if you want tax-free withdrawals later. If you need the tax break now, go traditional. Just make sure you're under the income limits!

3. **Taxable accounts** can be your flex zone. Once youâ€™ve milked those tax-advantaged accounts, toss extra funds here. Stick to low-turnover investments so you don't get slammed with capital gains taxes. 

Balance it all based on your risk tolerance and when you expect to need the cash. And hey, hit up a financial planner if you're feeling lostâ€”teamwork makes the money work!
