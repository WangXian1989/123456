To optimize your investment distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Prioritize putting higher-growth investments (like stocks) in these accounts to allow them to grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold more conservative investments (like bonds) or tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to manage capital gains and dividends effectively.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you're maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA up to the annual limits. For 2024, these limits are $23,000 for 401(k) (if under 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts, aligning with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider the overall asset allocation when adjusting individual accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - If you're nearing retirement, strategize the order of withdrawals considering the tax implications of distributions from each account type. Tax-deferred accounts are generally tapped last for non-essential expenses.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially as market values fluctuate.

Seeking advice from a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
