I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid saturated fats, added sugars, and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and reduce liver fat.

2. **Medical Treatments**:
   - **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms, such as antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.
   - **Monitoring and Management**: Regular check-ups, blood tests, and imaging studies to monitor liver health.

3. **Limit Alcohol and Avoid Toxins**:
   - Cease alcohol consumption and stay away from harmful substances that can strain the liver.

4. **Manage Underlying Conditions**:
   - Control conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol that can affect liver health.

For a tailored treatment plan, please consult a healthcare provider.
