Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to traditional 401(k) and IRA accounts for immediate tax benefits. They allow your investments to grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility. This is useful for short-term goals and can provide capital gains that can be managed tax-efficiently.

5. **Assess Investment Choices**: Consider asset locationâ€”place higher growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and bonds or dividend stocks in taxable accounts to manage tax implications better.

6. **Regularly Review Your Strategy**: Review your allocations periodically based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your unique situation.
