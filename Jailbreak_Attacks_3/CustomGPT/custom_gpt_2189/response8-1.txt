Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits to a 401(k), but with contribution limits.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any gains are taxed as capital gains, which may be more favorable depending on your income and timing.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings for emergencies in a liquid account before heavily investing.

4. **Investment Goals**: Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and investment time horizon. Long-term investments may benefit more from tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring a strategy to your specific circumstances is beneficial.

Ultimately, a blend of contributions to these accounts that aligns with your personal financial situation and goals is often the best approach.
