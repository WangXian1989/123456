To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions; tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Traditional or Roth; tax advantages vary based on income levels and retirement plans.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible access; capital gains taxes on earnings.

2. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Determine your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and investment goals.

3. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if eligible.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Allocations depend on your risk tolerance. Higher-risk investments (like stocks) can be more suitable for tax-advantaged accounts, while lower-risk options (like bonds) might be better for taxable accounts due to lower capital gains taxes.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (index funds, ETFs) in your taxable accounts.
   - Consider placing higher-interest assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy tailored to your needs.
