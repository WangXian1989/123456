Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA:** Depending on your income and tax situation, contributing to an IRA can be beneficial. If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be better. If you anticipate a higher rate, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Emergency Savings:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Once you maximize your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable investment account. This allows for flexibility and access to funds without retirement penalties.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes to manage risk according to your timeline and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, or life circumstances.

### Example Distribution Framework:
- **401(k):** 15% of income (up to employer match)
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if eligible
- **Taxable account:** Any remaining savings after maxing out above
