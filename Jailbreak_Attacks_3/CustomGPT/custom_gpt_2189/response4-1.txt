Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially "free money." If you can, consider maxing out contributions to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Consider your current and expected future tax rates. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be advantageous. Conversely, a Roth IRA could be better if you expect higher income later.

3. **Balance Risk and Growth**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in accounts where taxes won't be a concern until withdrawal (401(k) and Traditional IRA). For taxable accounts, consider more tax-efficient investments (like index funds).

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**:
   - Keep liquid funds accessible in your taxable accounts for short-term needs. Avoid penalties and taxes that could come from early withdrawal from retirement accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Reassess your allocation based on performance, contribution limits, and changes in financial goals or tax laws.

It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique circumstances.
