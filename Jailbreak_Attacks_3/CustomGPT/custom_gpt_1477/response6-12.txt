I'm not a doctor, but for liver issues, treatment options often vary based on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. Avoid alcohol and high-fat foods.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver), doctors may prescribe antiviral drugs or medications to improve liver function.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Routine blood tests and imaging can help monitor liver health and progression of disease.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases (like tumors or cirrhosis), liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan.
