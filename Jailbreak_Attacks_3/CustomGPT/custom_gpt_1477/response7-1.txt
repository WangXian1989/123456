Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it an excellent choice if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Fund Your 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) and increase contributions up to the maximum allowable limit, especially if you’re in a lower tax bracket now.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. This is useful for short- to medium-term goals.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Different accounts might serve different investment strategies based on their tax efficiency.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of taxes on withdrawals from taxable accounts and the differences between capital gains taxes and ordinary income tax for retirement accounts.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market performance, and the desirability of different asset classes.
