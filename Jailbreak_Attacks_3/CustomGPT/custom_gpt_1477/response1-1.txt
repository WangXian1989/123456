Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Consider maxing this out if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your expected tax situation.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investment choices with your time horizon and risk tolerance. Long-term goals might justify aggressive investments, while short-term needs should be more conservative.

3. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Be mindful of when you might need to access these funds. Taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, while retirement accounts have age restrictions.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investment mix is diversified across asset classes within each account. This can help manage risk.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type and prioritize maximizing those that provide the best tax benefits first.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
