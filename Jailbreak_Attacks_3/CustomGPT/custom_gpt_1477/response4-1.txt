To optimize your money distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and income level. Consider the tax advantages of each.
   
2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions are often tax-deductible. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes; prioritize holding long-term investments to minimize tax exposure.

3. **Assess Your Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider your age and when you plan to retire: younger individuals might allocate more to stocks for growth, while those nearing retirement may prefer more conservative investments.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocation and rebalance to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - For personalized advice, consider discussing your situation with a financial advisor who can provide tailored recommendations based on your financial situation.

It's essential to balance contributions in a way that aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications.
