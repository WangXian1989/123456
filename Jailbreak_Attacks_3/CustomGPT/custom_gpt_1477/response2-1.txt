Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax implications, investment goals, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may give you an upfront tax deduction.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match and IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k). This will help reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, as qualified dividends and long-term gains are typically taxed at a lower rate. This can include investments in index funds or ETFs.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative assets based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income. Plan to withdraw strategically in retirement to minimize tax liability.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your portfolio allocations annually to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.
