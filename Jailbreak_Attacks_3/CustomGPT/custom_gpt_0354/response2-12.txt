I'm not a doctor, but I can share some common treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Alcohol Abandonment**: Avoid alcohol to reduce liver strain.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplants may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some patients explore herbal supplements or acupuncture, but consult your doctor before trying these.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for diagnosis and tailored treatment options.
