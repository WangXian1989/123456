To efficiently distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Fund Your IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Tax-Efficient Investing in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs.
   - Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and lower-risk investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals in retirement strategically to minimize taxes, withdrawing from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like your 401(k) and traditional IRA).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
