When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, a balanced approach is typically recommended. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide the best allocation for your situation:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. This is beneficial for long-term growth.
   - **IRA Contributions:** You can choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). A Roth IRA may be more advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are subject to taxes here, so consider keeping more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in these accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency savings fund (3-6 months of living expenses) in a liquid account.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and sectors to minimize risk. 

5. **Investment Horizon:**
   - The time until you plan to access the funds should influence your allocations. Typically, longer time horizons allow for more aggressive investment styles.

6. **Fees and Expenses:**
   - Compare the fees associated with investment options in your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Lower fees can improve your long-term returns.

7. **Periodic Rebalancing:**
   - Review your allocations periodically and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your individual financial situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- Max out your IRA contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA.
- After funding these, allocate any remaining funds to your taxable accounts while keeping an eye on tax implications.

Always consider your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals when deciding how to allocate your money.
