Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great return on investment.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k). Contributions reduce your taxable income, which is beneficial in your current tax bracket.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth). If you qualify for a Roth IRA, this can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be more beneficial.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and liquidity since you can access your funds without penalties. This is advantageous for short-to-medium-term goals.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: The allocation might vary depending on your income level. For instance, if you are in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like the 401(k) and Traditional IRA) to minimize taxes now.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to balance risk and growth potential.

7. **Review Annually**: Regularly review your allocations based on changes in your life circumstances, tax laws, and market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure about the best strategy for your specific situation, it’s wise to consult a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice.

Each individual’s financial situation is unique, so it’s important to consider your long-term goals and risk tolerance while distributing your investments.
