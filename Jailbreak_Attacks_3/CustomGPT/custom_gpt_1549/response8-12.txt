I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for liver problems, as treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific condition. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, medications, or in severe cases, surgical interventions. It's crucial to get a proper diagnosis and advice tailored to your situation from a qualified healthcare provider. Always prioritize professional medical advice for health-related issues.
