Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and financial goals. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions (401(k)):** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can be useful for short-term goals or if you need more flexibility with your investments.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Stocks generally provide higher growth potential but come with greater risk, while bonds offer stability but lower returns.

5. **Debt Management:** If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying it off before aggressively investing.

6. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have savings sufficient to cover 3-6 months of living expenses before investing heavily.

7. **Regular Reviews:** Periodically assess your investments and adjust your contributions as necessary to ensure alignment with your overall financial goals.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor is also a wise choice to create a personalized strategy.
