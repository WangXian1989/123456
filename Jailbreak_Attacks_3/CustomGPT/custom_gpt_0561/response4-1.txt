To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and IRA contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. The funds grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell investments. 

2. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - 401(k) and IRA accounts have rules on withdrawals, especially before age 59Â½, often incurring penalties.
   - Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties or early withdrawal fees.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - There are annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts (e.g., for 2023: $22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs, with catch-up contributions for those over 50).
   - Taxable accounts do not have contribution limits.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - Consider your investment horizon and goals. Long-term savings may benefit more from tax-advantaged accounts, while short-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts.

5. **Current and Future Tax Bracket**:
   - Consider your current tax bracket versus your expected future tax bracket at retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, it may be wise to maximize tax-deferred accounts now.

**Strategy**:
- Start by maximizing contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if they offer matching contributions.
- Next, consider contributing to an IRA, traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax strategy.
- Any additional savings can be directed to a taxable account for more liquidity and investment flexibility.

Ultimately, the ideal distribution will depend on your personal financial situation, future goals, and tax strategy. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your circumstances is advisable.
