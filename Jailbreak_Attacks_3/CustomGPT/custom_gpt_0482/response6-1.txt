The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. The maximum contribution can help you reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for tax deductions now.
  
2. **Consider Investment Flexibility**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, utilize a taxable account for additional savings. This gives you flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, which can be beneficial for shorter-term goals.

3. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts to maintain a balanced portfolio, considering that some investments may be more tax-efficient in tax-advantaged accounts compared to taxable accounts.

4. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of each type of account. High-growth investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while income-generating investments might be better in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.
  
By strategically selecting how much to allocate to each account type, you can optimize tax efficiency and meet your financial objectives. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your unique situation.
