I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice based on your specific liver condition. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the underlying cause of the liver problem. Generally, they may include dietary changes, medications, lifestyle modifications, or, in more severe cases, surgery. It's important to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan from a qualified expert.
