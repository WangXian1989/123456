2. **Data Collection:**
   - Implement systems at entry points (e.g., office entrances) for clocking in/out.
   - Capture performance-related data through periodic assessments.

3. **Privacy Compliance:**
   - Ensure compliance with relevant laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) concerning biometric data.
   - Obtain employee consent before data collection.

### Benefits

- **Accurate Attendance Tracking:**
  - Reduces time theft and buddy punching.
  
- **Performance Insights:**
  - Analyze attendance patterns and correlate them with performance metrics.

### Challenges

- **Employee Privacy Concerns:**
  - Address potential pushback by clearly communicating how data will be used.
