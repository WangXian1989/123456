2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Nutritional support, including a balanced diet low in fats.
   - Alcohol abstinence to prevent further damage.

3. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine check-ups and tests to monitor liver function.

It's crucial to get a thorough evaluation and tailor treatment to your specific needs.
