To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim to max out your contribution if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate funds here last. These accounts can be useful for short-term goals or emergencies but are subject to capital gains tax.
   - Consider holding investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that each account type has a diversified portfolio to mitigate risk, utilizing a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets aligned with your risk tolerance.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals, ensuring you maintain your intended investment strategy.

By focusing on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first and understanding your tax implications, you can create a more efficient investment strategy.
