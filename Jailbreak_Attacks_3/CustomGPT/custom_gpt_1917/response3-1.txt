To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Identify your short-term and long-term financial goals. Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments, while place retirement savings in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Ensure youâ€™re maximizing contributions to your 401(k) (up to $22,500 for 2023, $30,000 if over 50).
   - Contribute to IRAs (up to $6,500 for 2023, $7,500 if over 50).

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Allocate investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider holding more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where taxes on gains are deferred.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

6. **Tax-Loss Harvesting**:
   - In taxable accounts, consider selling losing investments to offset gains and minimize tax liability.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consider working with a financial planner who can create a tailored strategy based on your financial situation.

By evaluating these factors, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient strategy for distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
