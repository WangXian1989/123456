To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum limit, especially if you have high income and are in a higher tax bracket. Consider the traditional option for tax deferral or a Roth option for tax-free growth.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to an IRA (Roth or traditional) after maximizing your 401(k). IRAs may provide more investment choices than a 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, direct additional savings into taxable accounts. This is particularly useful for short-term savings goals, as they provide easier access to funds without penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - For tax-advantaged accounts, consider growth-oriented investments due to their tax-sheltered nature.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, municipal bonds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically assess your portfolio to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances can greatly influence the best strategy, so consider seeking professional guidance tailored to your situation.

This balanced approach can help you optimize your overall investment strategy while considering tax implications.
