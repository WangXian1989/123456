Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get that full match first—it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA** contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the current year. Withdrawals during retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions are after-tax, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest for flexibility, but remember you’ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Use **401(k)** and **IRAs** primarily for retirement savings. 
   - Use **taxable accounts** for more accessible funds or goals with shorter timelines (like buying a house).

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Ensure you’re not overly concentrated in one asset class or investment type.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
