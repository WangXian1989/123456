Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s for long-term growth and tax benefits. If eligible, favor a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) in terms of tax treatment.
   - **Roth IRA**: No up-front tax benefits, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax on profits. Consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are well-diversified across these accounts, considering asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you're closer to retirement, shift towards more stable, income-generating investments. If you have a longer timeline, you can take more risks for potential growth.
