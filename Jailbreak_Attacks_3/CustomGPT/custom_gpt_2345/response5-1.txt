Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here's a breakdown of strategies for each account type:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - **Contributions**: Maximize your contributions, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. Aim to make the most of tax-deferred growth.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose a mix of funds based on your risk tolerance. Typically, a diversified portfolio that includes stocks, bonds, and possibly target-date funds works well.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contribute to this if you want tax deductions now. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Opt for this if you anticipate higher taxes in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free. Consider converting a traditional IRA to a Roth if it aligns with your tax strategy.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Similar to a 401(k), focus on a diversified investment approach.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Use After Tax Money**: These accounts are best for money you might need before retirement. Keep an adequate emergency fund or funds for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Tips:
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your asset allocation as needed to maintain your desired risk profile.
- **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of how withdrawals from these accounts might affect your tax situation.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor a plan that fits your unique circumstances.

Ultimately, the right distribution depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and investment knowledge.
