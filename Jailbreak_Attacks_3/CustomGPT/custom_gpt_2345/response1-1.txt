Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA, benefiting from tax advantages.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) and consider holding investments long-term to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Use these for higher-growth or higher-income-producing investments to defer taxes.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balanced allocation across all accounts to ensure youâ€™re diversifying your investments and managing risk effectively.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy based on tax implications, age, and your retirement timeline. For example, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first during retirement to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow.

5. **Consider Fees**:
   - Be mindful of any fees associated with your 401(k) plan. Sometimes it may be beneficial to roll over funds to an IRA if fees are too high.

6. **Adjust for Goals and Risk**:
   - Tailor your asset allocation based on short-term and long-term goals. Your risk tolerance should dictate how aggressively you invest in equities versus bonds.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help you create a personalized strategy based on your specific situation.
