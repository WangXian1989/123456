Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) first, especially if there's an employer match.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax strategy. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Balance with Taxable Accounts**: Once tax-advantaged accounts are maximized, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility and liquidity but may be subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments in these accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively. A mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance is key.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**: Place investments strategically:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Include investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Include higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts and bonds in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

7. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Adjust your contributions and asset allocation based on your retirement timeline and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help you tailor these strategies to your specific situation and optimize your overall investment approach.
