Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on investments that may have higher growth potential or generate higher income, as withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income.

### 3. **Diversification and Liquidity:**
   - Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts.
   - Keep some liquid assets in taxable accounts for emergencies, as withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties if taken before retirement age.

### 4. **Adjust Strategy Based on Age and Goals:**
   - Younger investors might focus more on growth in 401(k) and IRA accounts.
   - As you near retirement, consider shifting some assets to safer investments to protect against market volatility.

### 5. **Review and Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Regularly assess your investment allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

Ultimately, consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan based on your unique circumstances.
