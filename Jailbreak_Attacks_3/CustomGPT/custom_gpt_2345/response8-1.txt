Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Contributions**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose a diversified mix of funds; consider target-date funds for auto-rebalancing.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contribute if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal if you expect your tax rate to increase; contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Use for short-term goals**: Good for investing money you may need before retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Guidelines:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing heavily.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.
- **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications when selling investments in taxable accounts. Utilize capital losses to offset gains if needed.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of income, targeting max contribution.
- **IRA**: Max out annual limit if eligible.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds based on goals and risk tolerance.

### Review and Adjust:
- Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on market performance, life changes, or tax law changes. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
