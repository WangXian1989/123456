Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, especially with matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Maximize your contributions as much as possible, up to the annual limit ($20,500 for individuals under 50 and $27,000 for those 50 and older as of 2023).

2. **IRA Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) contributions (or if you donâ€™t have a 401(k)), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. IRAs offer tax advantages that can benefit your long-term savings. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can be particularly beneficial due to tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any funds that you can't put into tax-advantaged accounts can go into a taxable brokerage account. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investments but be mindful of the tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

**Overall Strategy**:
- Start with your 401(k) for the employer match.
- Contribute to an IRA for tax advantages.
- Utilize taxable accounts for additional savings and investments outside of retirement accounts.
