It’s great that you’re thinking about how to manage your investments effectively! Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k) Plans**: These often come with employer matches, so it's wise to contribute enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money. Consider how your 401(k) investments are allocated—diversifying among stocks, bonds, and possibly mutual funds can balance risk and growth.

2. **IRA Accounts**: Traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions upfront, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your income level and tax bracket, you might choose to prioritize one over the other. Also, both types have annual contribution limits to keep in mind.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: While these don’t have the same tax advantages, they offer flexibility. If you need access to funds before retirement age, or if you foresee needing money for significant purchases in the near future, taxable accounts can be a good choice. Consider investments that have favorable tax treatment, such as municipal bonds or long-term capital gain investments.

### Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Contributions**: Before allocating funds, attempt to max out any available contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs to leverage tax advantages.
- **Assess Risk Tolerance**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance across all accounts. Your 401(k) might be more growth-oriented if you’re younger, while your IRAs could lean towards balance as you approach retirement.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: As markets fluctuate, it’s essential to check back regularly and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given tax considerations can be complex, speaking with a certified financial planner may help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will align with your long-term financial goals, and it’s always beneficial to stay informed and adaptable to changes in your circumstances. If you have specific goals or numbers in mind, feel free to share!
