Distributing your money among different accounts such as a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some considerations to help you make an informed decision:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - Consider the investment options available in your 401(k) and their fees.

2. **IRA Contributions**: 
   - Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, which can lower your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, taxes will be owed upon withdrawal.
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met. They can be a great option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Funds in taxable accounts can provide flexibility as they are not subject to early withdrawal penalties like retirement accounts. 
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments in these accounts.

4. **Diversification & Risk Tolerance**: 
   - Consider how your investments are diversified across these accounts. It may be beneficial to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) and more conservative investments in a taxable account.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan how you intend to withdraw funds in retirement. Having a strategy for which accounts to draw from first can help minimize taxes over time.

It can be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy based on your specific circumstances. They can provide insightful guidance and help you navigate any complexities. How does this approach resonate with your current financial goals?
