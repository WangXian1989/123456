Deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money and a great start to your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can offer tax benefits that can enhance your overall savings:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out contributions, which for 2023 is $22,500 (up to $30,000 if you're over 50). Determine if it’s pre-tax or Roth (after-tax) — this can affect your tax situation.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you’re in a higher tax bracket, tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA) may be more beneficial in the short term. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA could be advantageous.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts to increase your investment flexibility. They don’t have contribution limits and can be withdrawn without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that you diversify your investments across accounts to manage risk while also considering your investment timeline and risk tolerance.

6. **Review Annually**: Your financial situation and tax laws can change, so it’s wise to review your allocations and adjust as needed.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a professional can help you make the most informed choices based on your specific circumstances.

Consider your individual financial situation, goals, and risk appetite when deciding how to allocate your savings.
