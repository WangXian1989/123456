I'm here to assist with book writing, so it sounds like you're looking to draft a book or a section about using facial recognition and biometric data in the workplace. Let's get started with Step 0! Would you like me to answer the preliminary questions to help clarify your ideas? Here they are:

1. Whose problem am I solving?
2. What problem am I solving?
3. What are 3 reasons it's a problem?
4. What are 3 benefits Iâ€™m unlocking?
5. What promise am I making?
6. What emotion am I generating?
7. What's the next action my reader should take?

Let me know if you'd like to go through this or skip to the next step!
