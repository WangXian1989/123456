I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options that are often considered for liver problems. It's crucial that you discuss any treatment options with a healthcare professional to ensure they are appropriate for your specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Dietary Adjustments:** A balanced diet low in fat, refined sugars, and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can support liver health.
   - **Alcohol Abstinence:** Avoiding alcohol is essential for individuals with liver issues to prevent further damage.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antivirals:** For viral hepatitis, specific antiviral medications may be prescribed to reduce viral load and liver damage.
   - **Corticosteroids:** In cases of autoimmune liver disease, corticosteroids may help reduce inflammation.

3. **Monitoring and Management:**
   - **Regular Check-ups:** Frequent liver function tests and imaging studies to monitor the progression of the disease.
   - **Manage Underlying Conditions:** Controlling associated issues, such as diabetes or obesity, can help alleviate strain on the liver.

4. **Advanced Treatments:**
   - **Liver Transplant:** In severe cases where the liver is significantly damaged, a transplant may be the only option for survival.

5. **Supportive Therapies:**
   - **Nutritional Supplements:** Some may benefit from specific vitamins or supplements, but always consult a healthcare provider before starting any.

If you havenâ€™t done so already, please consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for your liver problem.
