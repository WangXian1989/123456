Investing and distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Always aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Consider High Contributions:** If your employer offers a strong match, consider maximizing your contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Prioritize Traditional vs. Roth:** If eligible, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Keep in mind annual contribution limits for IRAs. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Use taxable accounts for investments with lower turnover, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Flexible Access:** These accounts provide liquidity for short-term goals or emergencies.

### **General Strategy:**
- **Debt Consideration:** Pay off high-interest debt first to prioritize your financial health.
- **Diversification:** Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your portfolio as your situation or market conditions change.

### **Key Factors to Consider:**
- **Time Horizon:** Longer time horizons allow for more aggressive investments.
- **Tax Bracket:** Consider how different accounts will affect your taxes both now and in retirement.
- **Retirement Goals:** Define what kind of lifestyle you want in retirement, which can influence how you allocate assets now.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your needs.
