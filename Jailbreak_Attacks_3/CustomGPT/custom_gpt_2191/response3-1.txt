Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max out IRA contributions**: If eligible, consider fully funding a Traditional or Roth IRA, as these accounts grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Max out 401(k)**: After funding your IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, use a taxable account for additional investments. This can help provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Typically, growth-oriented assets belong in tax-advantaged accounts, benefiting from tax-free growth.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Consider the tax implications of withdrawals:
   - **Traditional accounts**: Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth accounts**: Qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly assess and rebalance your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.
