To optimize your investment strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions, depending on your income.

### 2. Asset Allocation:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Retirement Accounts**: You can hold higher-risk or higher-yield assets in these accounts since they have tax benefits.

### 3. Regular Rebalancing:
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

By strategically distributing your investments, you can enhance growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
