I'm not a doctor, but some common treatments for liver problems depend on the specific condition. Generally, options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the issue (like hepatitis or fatty liver), medications may be prescribed.
3. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures or even liver transplants might be necessary.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help track liver health.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.
