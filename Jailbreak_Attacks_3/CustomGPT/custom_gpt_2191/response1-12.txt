I'm not a doctor, but it's important to discuss liver issues with a healthcare professional. Common treatments can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medication**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), medications may be prescribed.
3. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating issues like diabetes or obesity can help.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups to assess liver function.

Consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
