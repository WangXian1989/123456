Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Consider if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. Contributions may lower your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions grow tax-free, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**
   - After employer match and IRA contributions, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Invest in taxable accounts once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. This gives you flexibility for withdrawals and can provide capital gains and dividend income, which might be taxed at favorable rates.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, equities for long-term growth in retirement accounts and bonds or income-focused investments in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

### 6. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly reevaluate your investment strategy based on performance, tax law changes, and life circumstances.

### General Guidelines:
- **Short-term needs**: Keep funds in taxable accounts for liquidity.
- **Long-term needs**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for retirement saving.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances and goals.
