Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Traditional or Roth IRA**:
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Suitable if you want a tax deduction now and expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you max out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in a taxable account. This is flexible and can provide funds for short-term goals. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and asset allocation strategy. Generally, itâ€™s best to hold more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Reassessment**: Review your contributions and asset allocation periodically to ensure they align with your changing financial situation and goals.
