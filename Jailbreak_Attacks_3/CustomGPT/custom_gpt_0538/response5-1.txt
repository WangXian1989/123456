(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, a balanced approach could be:

1. **401(k)**: Since contributions are often pre-tax, aim to maximize any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket, prioritize contributions here.

2. **IRA**: If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Otherwise, a traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for shorter-term goals or after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

Regularly review your allocations and adjust as needed based on your evolving financial situation.
