Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider maximizing contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next, as this can provide tax advantages. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may give you tax deductions now.

3. **Continue with the 401(k)**: Once you’ve maxed out your IRA contributions (if possible), continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This can help reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals but may be subject to capital gains tax.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like ETFs or index funds) in taxable accounts and keep less tax-efficient options (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your investments and adjust based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
