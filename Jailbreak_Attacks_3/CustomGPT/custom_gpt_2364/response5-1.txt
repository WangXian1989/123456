Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is free money!).
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if eligible, as it offers tax-free growth.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)/Traditional IRA**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are post-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Taxes apply annually on dividends and capital gains.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider risk tolerance and investment goals. Typically, more aggressive investments (like stocks) can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts due to long-term tax benefits, while more conservative investments (like bonds) can be in taxable accounts to manage tax impact.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you intend to withdraw from these accounts in retirement to minimize tax impact, potentially withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 5. **Regular Review**:
   - Monitor and rebalance your allocations regularly to ensure alignment with your goals and market conditions.

### Example Allocation:
- **Max 401(k)**: To the employer match limit.
- **IRA**: Max out if you can contribute.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Contribute any additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion:
Tailor your strategy based on your specific financial situation and objectives. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is also a smart move.
