Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k), contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). Roth IRAs are particularly advantageous for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: Once you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider adding funds to a taxable account. This allows for more flexibility in terms of withdrawals but will incur capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Focus on growth in accounts intended for long-term savings (like 401(k) and IRAs).
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more conservative investments in taxable accounts if you anticipate needing access to cash in the near future.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts based on your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**
   - **Annual Check-Up**: Review your allocations annually to adjust for changes in your financial situation or goals.

### Summary
- **Max out 401(k) to capture match**
- **Contribute to an IRA**
- **Invest in taxable accounts last**
- **Diversify across all accounts** 

This approach helps minimize taxes while optimizing investment growth over time.
