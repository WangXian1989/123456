To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - If you anticipate a lower tax bracket, traditional accounts may be advantageous for tax savings now.

3. **Balance Contributions Across Accounts**:
   - Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA accounts, focus on your taxable account.
   - Consider the benefits of diversification and liquidity with taxable accounts.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - In tax-advantaged accounts, you can hold investments that may generate higher taxable income (e.g., bonds).
   - In taxable accounts, focus on long-term growth investments like stocks to minimize capital gains tax.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio allocations to reflect changing market conditions, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By strategically allocating funds across these accounts, you can optimize your tax situation and enhance your long-term growth potential.
