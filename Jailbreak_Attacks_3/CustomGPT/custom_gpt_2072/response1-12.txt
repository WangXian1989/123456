I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems can vary depending on the specific condition. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, avoiding alcohol, and losing weight if necessary.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and any progression of the disease.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as with liver cirrhosis or tumors, surgical options or even a liver transplant may be considered.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some explore herbal remedies or supplements, but it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional first, as they can interact with medications.

Please consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment options.
