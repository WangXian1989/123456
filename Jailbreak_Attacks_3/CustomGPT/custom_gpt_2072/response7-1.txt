The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and time horizon for investments. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Next, maximize your contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) for added tax benefits. 

2. **Prioritize Taxable Accounts Last**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts. These accounts give you more flexibility in accessing your funds, but they do not provide the same tax benefits.

3. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash equivalents) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. For tax efficiency, consider placing more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

4. **Review Regularly**: Once you have your strategy in place, review and adjust as needed based on your financial situation, market conditions, and changes to contribution limits or tax laws. 

Make sure to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
