Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions if you can, especially if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - The IRA can complement your 401(k) by diversifying tax treatment.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for investments that you might need to access before retirement.
   - Use these for short-term goals or to hold investments that benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Balance tax-deferred and tax-free accounts to manage your taxable income in retirement.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds and strategies in the taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in risk tolerance, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific circumstances and goals.

This approach can optimize your savings while balancing growth potential and tax implications.
