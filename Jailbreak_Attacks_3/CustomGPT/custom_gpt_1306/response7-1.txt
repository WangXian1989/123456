Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment characteristics. Here are some guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax or Roth (after-tax), which can help lower your taxable income now or in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer the same tax advantages but give you more flexibility with withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments that are expected to appreciate significantly, as this allows for tax-deferred growth.
   - Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in place, typically 3-6 months’ worth of expenses, before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you're closer to retirement, it may make sense to lean more toward conservative investments in your 401(k) and IRA. Younger individuals can typically afford to invest more aggressively.

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, you may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor recommendations based on your specific financial situation and goals.
