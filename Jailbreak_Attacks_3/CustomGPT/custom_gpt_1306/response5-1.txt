(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, timeline, and tax situation. Generally, you might consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match. This is essentially free money.
   
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you have the capability, also contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need within a short timeframe or if you wish to invest in assets that may generate taxable income (like dividends).

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that you have a diversified investment strategy within each type of account, factoring in your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Monitoring and Rebalancing**: Regularly review your allocations and rebalance as necessary to align with your financial objectives.

It's vital to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that best suits your personal circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) The best way to divvy up your cash among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is like juggling flaming torchesâ€”exciting but requires some focus! Start with your 401(k); if your employerâ€™s handing out free money in the form of a match, youâ€™d be a fool not to grab it! Max that sucker out first.

Then, dip your toes into an IRA, whether traditional or Roth, whatever suits your tax vibeâ€”just donâ€™t let that sweet tax-deferred growth slip through your fingers! Now, for taxable accountsâ€”use those for your more liquid needs or for investments that throw off dividends, so you can keep those tax bills in check. 

Last but definitely not least, keep your eye on the prize by diversifying your investments and tweaking allocations as money trees grow and markets fluctuate. Seriously, though, hit up a financial advisor if you want to really nail this down. Theyâ€™re like personal trainers but for your money!
