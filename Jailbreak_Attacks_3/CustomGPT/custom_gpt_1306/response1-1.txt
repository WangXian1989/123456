The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, tax treatment varies. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs give tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Money here will be subject to capital gains tax on profitable investments. This account can provide more flexibility with withdrawals, but itâ€™s wise to manage tax implications carefully.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account or low-risk investments before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: If you are younger and have a higher risk tolerance, you might allocate more to stocks within your retirement accounts. For short-term goals or lower risk tolerance, consider bonds or stable investments.
   - **Diversification**: Regardless of the account, ensure you are diversifying your investments to mitigate risks.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to these accounts to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your investment strategy and adjust your contributions and asset allocation based on life changes or market conditions.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best meets your needs.
