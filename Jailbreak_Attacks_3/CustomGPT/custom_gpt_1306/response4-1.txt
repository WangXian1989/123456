When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA (Individual Retirement Account), and taxable accounts, several factors should be taken into account, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy that may help:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize IRA Contributions**: If you can afford to, contribute to an IRA. Depending on your income, you may qualify for a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 for individuals under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and older.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) and consider maxing it out next. The 401(k) contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 for individuals under 50 and $30,000 for those 50 and older.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: If you've already maximized retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility since you can withdraw money at any time without penalties.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**: Be strategic about what investments go where:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Hold investments that generate high income (like bonds) or that have the potential for high short-term capital gains, as withdrawals from these accounts are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Consider holding investments that you expect to grow significantly since qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your investment distribution and rebalance your portfolio as necessary according to your risk tolerance and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain, it's wise to consult a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice based on your individual circumstances.

Remember, the right distribution strategy can vary greatly depending on personal financial situations and goals. Always consider your current financial needs and long-term retirement goals.
