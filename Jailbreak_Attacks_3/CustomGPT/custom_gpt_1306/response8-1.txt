The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your investment goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions are typically tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute.
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, so if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth may be more beneficial.
   - Taxable accounts do not provide upfront tax benefits, but you can modulate your tax liabilities through capital gains management.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Generally, use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that are likely to produce higher taxable income (e.g., bonds, REITs), while keeping more tax-efficient investments (e.g., stocks) in taxable accounts.
   - Consider your risk tolerance and duration of investments. Long-term investments can usually be placed in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified across all accounts, balancing risk and return according to your financial goals.

5. **Regular Review and Adjustments**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance if necessary to ensure it aligns with your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider discussing your specific situation with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial picture.

Ultimately, the allocation should reflect your individual circumstances, including your retirement timeline, cash flow needs, tax bracket, and investment preferences.
