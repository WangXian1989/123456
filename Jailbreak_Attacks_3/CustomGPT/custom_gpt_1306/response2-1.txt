The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your employer match, contribute to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of the tax benefits these accounts offer. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may give you a tax deduction on your contributions.

3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt (like credit cards), consider paying that down before investing heavily in retirement accounts. The interest on debt can often outweigh potential investment gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Decide how to allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, younger investors can take on more risk (stocks) as they have time to recover from market fluctuations, while older investors might focus on more stable investments (bonds).

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens. Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Establish a routine to regularly contribute to each account type to maintain discipline and benefit from dollar-cost averaging.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your investment allocations and adjust based on your financial situation and changing goals. 

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider working with a financial advisor to create a personalized investment strategy based on your unique situation.

Always ensure your investment strategy aligns with your long-term goals, risk tolerance, and any tax implications pertaining to your individual circumstances.
