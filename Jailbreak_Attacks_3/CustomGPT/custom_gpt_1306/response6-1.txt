When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider a strategy that maximizes tax efficiency and aligns with your financial goals. Here are a few key points to guide you:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you can, aim to maximize your contributions to take advantage of the tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs are also beneficial for tax-deferred growth, but withdrawals will be taxable.
  
### 2. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Understand your current and expected future tax brackets to determine where to allocate funds. Placing investments with high expected growth (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts can be beneficial to avoid taxes on capital gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that yield lower taxes, such as municipal bonds or ETFs that are tax-efficient.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - Diversify investments across various asset classes in each account type. This helps manage risk while optimizing returns and tax implications.

By strategically distributing your assets, you can leverage the benefits of each account type to enhance your overall financial position for retirement. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
