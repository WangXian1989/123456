When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider factors like your current tax bracket, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maximizing contributions to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRAs for long-term, growth-oriented investments since they have tax advantages. You can afford to take a more aggressive stance here.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds) and those that may generate less taxable income (like tax-exempt bonds).

3. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically assess the performance of your investments across all accounts and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when rebalancing taxable accounts.

4. **Consider Future Withdrawals**:
   - Think about your withdrawal strategy in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket, consider how you'll withdraw from these accounts to minimize tax implications.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced distribution strategy tailored to your financial goals and situation. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these suggestions to your specific circumstances.
