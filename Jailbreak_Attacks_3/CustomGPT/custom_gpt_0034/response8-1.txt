To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and IRA): Prioritize contributions to these accounts to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to spread risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when you'll withdraw funds, considering tax implications for each account type.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your investment allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level across accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can offer personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

This approach can help you achieve a balanced, tax-efficient investment portfolio.
