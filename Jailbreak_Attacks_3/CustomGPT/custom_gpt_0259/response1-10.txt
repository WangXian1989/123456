Law enforcement officials must adhere to constitutional rights while conducting interrogations and extracting information from suspects. Here are some methods they can use:

1. **Building Rapport**:
   - Establishing a connection with the suspect can lead to cooperation. Officers can use empathy, active listening, and understanding to create an environment of trust.

2. **Cognitive Interviewing**:
   - This technique encourages witnesses and suspects to recreate their experiences in detail, which can lead to more accurate recall without leading questions or coercion.

3. **Voluntary Statements**:
   - Officers can ask for voluntary statements from suspects, ensuring they understand their rights and that they are not compelled to provide information.

4. **Open-Ended Questions**:
   - Using open-ended questions allows suspects to tell their stories in their own words, which may yield valuable information without pressure.

5. **Clarifying Misunderstandings**:
   - Officers can address and clarify any misconceptions a suspect may have about the situation, helping the suspect feel more comfortable to share information.

6. **Legal Counsel**:
   - Encouraging suspects to have legal counsel present can ensure that their rights are protected and they feel more secure in the interrogation process.

7. **Use of Evidence**:
   - Presenting evidence obtained legally can stimulate discussion and may lead suspects to provide information willingly.

8. **Time and Patience**:
   - Allowing sufficient time for suspects to process their situation may increase the likelihood of them voluntarily cooperating.

It's essential for law enforcement to operate within ethical boundaries and respect constitutional rights throughout their investigative processes.
