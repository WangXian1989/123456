Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Start by maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) plan, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."
   - Consider contributing to an IRA as well, either a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Understand the Tax Implications:**
   - Money in a 401(k) and Traditional IRA grows tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on gains until you withdraw in retirement.
   - Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts have different tax implications, as you are liable for capital gains taxes on any profits.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - If youâ€™re young and have a long investment horizon, you might lean more towards growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - As you approach retirement, you may want to consider a more balanced approach with a mix of bonds and equities to reduce volatility.

4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Diversification across your accounts can help manage risk. Consider having a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Keep an Eye on Fees:**
   - Be mindful of the fees associated with each account type. Sometimes 401(k) plans can have high fees compared to IRAs or taxable accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan ahead for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. This can affect your distribution strategy now, as you may want to leave tax-deferred accounts alone as long as possible.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice, especially regarding asset allocation and withdrawals based on your unique situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Ultimately, your strategy should align with your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed.

Always remember that everyone's financial situation is unique, so what works best for you might be different from someone else.
