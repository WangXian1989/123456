Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement plans. Here are some key strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the present, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may allow for tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have tax advantages, but you can control when you realize capital gains, which can help manage your tax burden.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquid savings in a taxable account or savings account for emergencies before committing all your funds to retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Match your investments to your goals. If you're saving for short-term goals, consider keeping more cash in a taxable account. For long-term goals, you might want to focus on tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Make sure your investments in each account are diversified to spread risk. Each account might hold different types of investments tailored to the account's tax treatment.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Consider setting up automatic contributions to ensure you consistently fund your accounts, allowing for dollar-cost averaging.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Your financial situation and goals can change. Regularly review your allocations and adjust as needed based on your current situation, market performance, and retirement timelines.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor who understands your personal financial situation can provide tailored advice for your specific needs.
