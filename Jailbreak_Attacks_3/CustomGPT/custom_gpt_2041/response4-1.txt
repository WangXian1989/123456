Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" for your retirement.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Consider your current tax situation: a Traditional IRA can provide a tax deduction now, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Focus on Tax-Efficient Investments:** In your taxable accounts, prioritize investments that generate lower capital gains, such as index funds or ETFs that are less likely to trigger taxes through frequent trading.

4. **Balance Investment Types:** Consider what types of investments to hold in each account type. For example, more volatile investments (like stocks) might perform better in a tax-advantaged account, while stable investments (like bonds) might be better positioned in a taxable account to take advantage of lower tax rates.

5. **Assess Your Tax Situation:** Consider your current and expected future tax rates. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial. Conversely, a Traditional IRA might be better if you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly:** Regularly assess your asset allocation and distributions based on changes in your income, tax laws, and financial goals.

7. **Seek Professional Advice:** Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your individual circumstances, as they can provide personalized insights based on your financial situation.

Ultimately, the best strategy will be individualized, so it's essential to consider your overall financial picture when making these decisions.
