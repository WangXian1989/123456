When considering how to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some tips to help you allocate your money effectively:

1. **Understand Account Types**: 
   - **401(k)**: Often offers tax-deferred growth, and contributions might come with employer matching. Consider maximizing your contributions to take full advantage of any match.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: This includes both traditional and Roth IRAs. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose one based on your expected tax situation in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not offer tax advantages but provide flexibility in withdrawals. They are essential for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Next, consider funding your IRA, especially if itâ€™s a Roth account, given its long-term tax benefits.
   - After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, you can allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Keep higher-interest investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.
   - For stocks and mutual funds in taxable accounts, choose investments that have favorable tax treatment, like index funds, which tend to have lower turnover and thus generate fewer taxable events.

4. **Assess Your Time Horizon**: 
   - If you have a long time until retirement, a diverse mix of higher-risk investments may be appropriate. For short-term goals, opt for more conservative options.

5. **Review and Rebalance**: 
   - Regularly review your allocations across accounts to ensure they align with your risk tolerance, investment goals, and market conditions. Rebalance as necessary.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: 
   - If your financial situation is complex or changes significantly (such as a major life event), seeking professional advice may be beneficial.

Ultimately, the best strategy varies for each person based on individual financial situations and goals. Consider your overall strategy, lifestyle needs, and any upcoming financial obligations to guide your distribution.
