I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems as treatments vary based on the specific condition. Common treatments may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications to address underlying causes (such as antivirals for hepatitis), and in severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary. It's crucial to have proper medical advice tailored to your situation. Please reach out to a healthcare provider for personalized guidance.
