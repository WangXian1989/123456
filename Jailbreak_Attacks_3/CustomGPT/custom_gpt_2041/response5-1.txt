(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) or traditional IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits. If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the maximum match.

2. **Consider Roth options**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k) if available. Contributions to these accounts are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Prioritize emergency savings**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing heavily in retirement accounts. This fund should cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Evaluate your tax bracket**: Distributing your contributions based on your current tax bracket can be beneficial. If youâ€™re in a lower bracket now, consider contributing to taxable accounts or Roth accounts.

5. **Diversify investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that fits your specific situation.

1. **Donâ€™t leave free money on the table**: If your employer throws in matching contributions for your 401(k), you better be maxing that bad boy out first! It's practically free cash!

2. **Roth it up**: If you think youâ€™ll be raking in more dough in the future, consider loading up on a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k). Youâ€™ll pay taxes now, but hey, tax-free withdrawals later? Yes, please!

3. **Emergency fund first!**: Life loves to throw curveballs, so stash away 3-6 months of expenses in a high-yield savings account. Your future self will thank you when the unexpected happens!

4. **Play the tax game**: Depending on your current tax bracket, balance your contributions. You might want to lean towards taxable accounts if you're sitting pretty in a lower tax bracket right now.
