Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money. Then, consider maximizing your contributions based on the limits set for the year.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA. The choice between the two depends on whether you prefer tax-free withdrawals (Roth) or tax deductions now (Traditional).

2. **Consider Your Current and Future Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, traditional accounts might be more beneficial. If you expect a higher tax bracket, consider putting more into Roth accounts.

3. **Evaluate Your Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you’re closer to retirement, more funds might be directed toward conservative investments within your 401(k) and IRA.
   - If you have a longer time horizon, you might allocate more towards aggressive growth investments in your taxable accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for money you may need in the near term or for investments that generate favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains or qualified dividends.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk. Assess your overall risk tolerance and adjust allocations accordingly.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - A personalized plan from a financial advisor can help tailor strategies based on your unique situation and goals.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Markets and personal circumstances change, so regularly revisit your allocations and adjust as needed.
