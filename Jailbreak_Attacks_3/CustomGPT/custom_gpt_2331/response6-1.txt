To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contributions up to the annual limit if financially feasible.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation. Max out contributions to take advantage of tax benefits.

2. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Allocate Investments Wisely:** 
     - Keep tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or real estate) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA).
     - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize your tax bracket, considering the order of withdrawals from accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund accessible in cash or a savings account before maximizing long-term investments.

4. **Consider Your Goals:** Align your investment strategy with your short-term and long-term financial goals, adjusting asset allocation as needed based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

By distributing your money thoughtfully across these accounts, you'll optimize for growth while managing taxes effectively.
