The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Max out employer-sponsored plans (like 401(k))**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider tax implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can help lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax benefits similar to a 401(k), whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when you sell them for a profit, but you have more flexibility in accessing your funds.

3. **Diversify investments**: Make sure you're not only diversifying across accounts but also within them. Consider your risk tolerance and invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Emergency fund**: Ensure you have enough in an emergency fund before diving into investments. This usually means having 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses saved in a liquid account.

5. **Long-term goals**: If you're saving for specific goals (like buying a house or retirement), tailor your distribution based on timelines and risk profiles.

6. **Consult a financial advisor**: Since each person's situation is unique, talking to a professional can help you create a personalized strategy that aligns with your specific objectives.

Always review your financial strategy periodically and adjust as your life circumstances change!
