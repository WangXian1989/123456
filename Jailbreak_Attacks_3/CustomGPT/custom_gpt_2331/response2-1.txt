When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Implications:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. If you're eligible, consider funding a Roth IRA for long-term tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Diversification of Contributions:** Depending on your tax bracket and retirement timeline, you might want to balance contributions:
   - Higher contributions to tax-advantaged accounts if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Individual retirement accounts (IRA) for additional tax-deferred growth.

4. **Liquidity Needs:** Keep in mind your short-term financial goals. Taxable accounts can provide quicker access to funds without penalties.

5. **Investment Strategy:** Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts. 

6. **Annual Review:** Regularly review and rebalance your investment allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and to ensure youâ€™re optimizing for both growth and tax efficiency.
