The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into a taxable account. Next, consider maximizing contributions to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Funds in 401(k) and traditional IRA accounts grow tax-deferred, while qualified withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. On the other hand, Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth, and contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. Depending on your current and expected future tax rates, you might prioritize contributions differently.

3. **Investment Goals & Time Horizon**: If you have short-term goals (like buying a home in a few years), you might lean towards a taxable account for liquidity. For long-term growth (retirement), prioritize retirement accounts. 

4. **Diversification of Investments**: Depending on your investment expertise and market outlook, you can choose to diversify your investments across these accounts. Allocating different asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) can provide balanced growth and risk management.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw money in retirement. You often want to deplete taxable accounts first, as they can incur capital gains tax, then traditional accounts, and finally Roth accounts, which allow for tax-free withdrawals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about how to allocate your funds effectively, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your situation.

Overall, a balanced approach that considers tax advantages, liquidity needs, and investment goals will help you achieve a better distribution among your accounts.
