The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, your age, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to meet that match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially "free money."

2. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA. Roth IRAs grow tax-free and are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and investments but are less tax-efficient. They can be a good place for investments expected to produce capital gains, as capital gains on assets held longer than a year are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Investment Allocation**: Diversify your portfolio within each account type. Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon when choosing asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).

5. **Tax Considerations**: Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) and IRAs). This strategy can help manage taxes and maximize growth.

6. **Age and Time Horizon**: Younger individuals might favor higher risk in their portfolios, while those closer to retirement may want to shift toward more conservative investments.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to fit your personal circumstances.

**Shortened version:**  
Consider employer match for 401(k), IRA type, tax implications, investment horizon, and risk tolerance.
