To optimize your investment strategy, it’s essential to understand the unique attributes of each account type. Here are some general guidelines for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Once you’ve maximized any employer match, consider funding an IRA since it may offer more investment options.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Both accounts offer tax-deferred growth. Traditional 401(k)s and IRAs allow for pre-tax contributions, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals (after meeting requirements).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes. It’s optimal to hold investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Aggressive vs. Conservative:** Typically, growth stocks or aggressive strategies work well in tax-advantaged accounts, while conservative investments such as bonds might be better suited for taxable accounts.
   - **Asset Location:** Consider keeping higher-growth and more volatile investments in tax-deferred accounts and income-producing assets in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review your asset allocation annually or as needed to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you maintain an adequate emergency fund outside of these investment accounts to avoid early withdrawal penalties and taxes.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. However, it’s always good to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

**Shortened version:**  
Prioritize contributions, consider tax implications, and define an investment strategy.
