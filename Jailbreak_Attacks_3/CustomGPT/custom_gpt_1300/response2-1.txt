The best way to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on several factors including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment options available in each account type. Here are a few guidelines to consider:

1. **Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), consider contributing enough to take full advantage of the match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA & 401(k))**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s, as they provide tax benefits either in the form of tax deductions (traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth).

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for each type of account. For 401(k)s and IRAs, these limits can change annually.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Generally, it might be wise to hold investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep those with lower tax liabilities (like stocks) in taxable accounts. 

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Consider how much liquidity you might need in the short term. Taxable accounts provide more flexibility since you can access funds without penalties.

6. **Long-Term Growth**: If you're younger and focused on long-term growth, maxing out retirement accounts may be more beneficial regardless of the tax implications.

7. **Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your investment distribution aligns with your risk tolerance and investment strategy, which might vary across the different account types.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given that individual situations vary considerably, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Overall, a balanced approach that maximizes tax advantages while considering your financial goals and personal circumstances is usually the best strategy.
