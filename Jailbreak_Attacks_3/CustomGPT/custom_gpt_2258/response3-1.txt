The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching and offers pre-tax or Roth contributions. Investment options may be limited.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers a broader range of investment options and can be tax-deductible (Traditional IRA) or tax-free in retirement (Roth IRA).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages but offer flexibility in withdrawals and a wider range of investment options. Capital gains taxes apply to profits.

2. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Determine your retirement goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. If you are younger, you might take more risks; if you are closer to retirement, consider safer investments.

3. **Maximize Employer Matches**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match; this is essentially free money.

4. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts**:
   - After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income, you can choose between a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA.
   - For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k) (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older) and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth to minimize taxes. Taxable accounts can be beneficial for short-term goals or liquidity but may incur capital gains taxes.

6. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, diversify your investments between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance. Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts. Aim for 3-6 months’ worth of expenses in liquid assets.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you are unsure about your allocation strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

### Sample Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 50% (max out employer match)
- **IRA**: 30% (focus on tax efficiency)
- **Taxable Account**: 20% (for short-term or flexible needs)

Review and adjust your strategy annually based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Conclusion:
- The best distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be strategic, taking into account tax implications, investment options, and personal financial goals. Always consider your need for liquidity and the impact of taxes when deciding how to allocate funds.

Remember, individual circumstances vary, and it may be beneficial to tailor this strategy to fit your needs more closely.
