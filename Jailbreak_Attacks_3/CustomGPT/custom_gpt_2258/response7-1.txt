Distributing your money strategically among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for maximizing returns and minimizing tax implications. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a match on contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first—it’s essentially free money. The 401(k) is tax-advantaged, allowing your investments to grow tax-deferred until withdrawal. Prioritize investing in it, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA Accounts**: Whether you choose a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA depends on your tax situation. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions now, deferring taxes until retirement. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but taxes are paid at the time of contribution. Consider your current and expected future tax rates when deciding.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts don’t have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts, but they offer more liquidity and flexibility. Taxable accounts can be advantageous for short-term goals or if you plan to access funds before retirement. Consider placing investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains here to minimize tax hits.

### Tips for Allocation:
- **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of living expenses).
- **Diversification**: Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across accounts to maintain your target allocation.

### Example Strategy:
1. Max out the employer match in your 401(k).
2. Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible; otherwise, a Traditional IRA.
3. Use a taxable account for any additional savings, targeting tax-efficient investments.

A personalized strategy may benefit from consulting with a financial advisor, as they can provide tailored advice based on your specific financial situation.
