Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and should often be a priority.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the contribution year. Taxes are due upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - In a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as income in retirement. 
     - In a Roth IRA, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer tax advantages, but you can control when you realize gains and pay taxes.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before fully investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund. This typically covers 3-6 months' worth of expenses.

4. **Diversification**: Within each account type, ensure you're diversifying your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Younger investors might favor more aggressive investments in their 401(k) or IRA, while those closer to retirement might skew towards more conservative investments.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Aim to regularly contribute to all accounts. Setting up automatic contributions can help maintain discipline.

7. **Reassess and Rebalance**: Periodically review your portfolio and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your individual circumstances, including your age, risk tolerance, retirement goals, and current financial situation. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your needs.
