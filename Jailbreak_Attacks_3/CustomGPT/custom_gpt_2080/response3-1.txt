Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer matches contributions to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum amount, especially if you're in a high tax bracket. Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. If you want tax deductions now, go for a Traditional IRA.

3. **Diversify Investments**: In taxable accounts, consider prioritizing investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or municipal bonds, since they may generate less taxable income.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a highly liquid account before heavily investing.

5. **Adjust Based on Goals**: If you're saving for short-term goals, lean more on taxable accounts. For long-term growth, maximize contributions to retirement accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly assess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type to plan your distributions effectively in retirement.

By balancing contributions across these accounts based on your immediate needs and long-term goals, you can optimize your financial strategy. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
