Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before diverting funds elsewhere.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider prioritizing contributions here due to potential employer matching and tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, you might choose a Traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need before retirement or for investments that may be subject to different tax treatments. Consider tax-efficient investments here, such as index funds or ETFs.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Retirement Timeline**: Assess when you plan to access these funds. Longer timelines may favor aggressive growth strategies.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
