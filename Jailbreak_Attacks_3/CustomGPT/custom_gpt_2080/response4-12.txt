I'm not a doctor, but there are several treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adoption of a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function can help manage the condition.

4. **Supportive Care**: In cases of chronic liver disease, treatments like managing symptoms and complications are key.

5. **Surgery**: Severe conditions, such as liver tumors or cirrhosis, may require surgical interventions or procedures like a liver transplant.

6. **Nutritional Support**: Working with a dietitian can help ensure proper nutrition that supports liver health.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare provider for a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.
