Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Diversification**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider this account for higher income years.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional IRA (pre-tax) or a Roth IRA (post-tax), consider your current vs. expected future tax rate. Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility and potential capital gains, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Investment Growth**: 
   - Consider putting higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes on growth.
   - Keep income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where you can manage the timing of capital gains and harvest tax losses.

4. **Age Considerations**:
   - Younger investors might prioritize Roth accounts for long-term growth.
   - Closer to retirement, focus on preserving capital in 401(k) or IRA accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals to minimize taxes during retirement. Utilize tax-efficient strategies for withdrawals from each account type.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Tailor an investment strategy specifically for your financial situation and goals.

Always review your allocations periodically as your financial situation and market conditions change.
