When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Max out employer match contributions to benefit from free money.
   - Consider contributing up to the annual limit to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - Aim to max out contributions for additional tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for goals with a shorter time horizon (like saving for a house).
   - Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Factors to Consider:
- **Tax implications**: Different accounts have different tax treatments, so consider your current and projected future income.
- **Investment goals**: Align your distribution strategy with your financial goals and timeline.
- **Risk tolerance**: Ensure your investments match your comfort level with risk.

### A Balanced Approach:
- Start with employer match and tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
- Allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts as needed, prioritizing investments that offer tax efficiency.

It's often wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your situation.
