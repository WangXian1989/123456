The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current and expected future tax brackets, retirement goals, and investment options available in each account. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute up to the limit, especially if you have access to a good selection of funds and low fees.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower tax burdens, such as index funds or individual stocks held long-term.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** These are beneficial for higher-income investments that may generate higher short-term capital gains or interest.

4. **Rebalance Periodically:** Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation based on performance and changing goals.

5. **Emergency Fund:** Maintain an emergency fund in liquid assets outside of retirement accounts for unexpected expenses.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized strategies, especially regarding tax implications and investment choices, it may be beneficial to consult a financial professional.

This general framework can be tailored to fit your specific financial situation and goals.
