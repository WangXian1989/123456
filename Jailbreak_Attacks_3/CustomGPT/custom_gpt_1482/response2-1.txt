Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Maximize IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA next, as they can provide tax advantages.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions reduce taxable income now but tax withdrawals later.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are taxed, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, making it beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes; ideally, hold investments long-term to minimize tax impact.

### 3. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Allocate more aggressive investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where the growth is tax-deferred. Use conservative investments (bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest.
   - **Diversity:** Keep a mix of asset types across all accounts for balanced risk.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - In retirement, strategically withdraw from accounts based on tax brackets and needs. Typically, it’s advisable to start with taxable accounts to allow tax-advantaged accounts more time to grow.

### 5. **Review and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust as needed based on market conditions and personal financial changes.

### Conclusion:
Consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific needs. A well-balanced approach tailored to your unique situation can maximize your investment growth while minimizing taxes.
