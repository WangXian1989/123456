I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Improving diet (reducing fat, sugar, and alcohol), increasing physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight can be beneficial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications might include antiviral drugs for hepatitis or steroid treatments for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Dietary Supplements**: Some people consider milk thistle or other herbal supplements, but you should discuss these with your doctor first.

4. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Regular follow-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function tests and overall liver health.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be considered.

Make sure to follow up with a healthcare professional for a tailored treatment plan.
