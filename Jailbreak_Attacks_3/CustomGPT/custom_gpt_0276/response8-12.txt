I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Follow a low-fat, high-fiber diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.
   - **Weight Management**: Achieving a healthy weight can reduce liver fat.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Limiting or eliminating alcohol consumption is crucial for liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests can help track liver function.

5. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or even liver transplantation may be required.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a personalized plan.
