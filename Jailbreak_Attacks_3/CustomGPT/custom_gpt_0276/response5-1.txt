**Best Ways to Distribute Money Among 401(k), IRA, and Taxable Accounts**

1. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - Determine your retirement goals, timeline, and risk tolerance.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's basically free money).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maxing the 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account. For 2023, contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs, with catch-up contributions allowed for those over 50.

4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account, diversify across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) based on your risk profile.

5. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are often pre-tax, leading to lower taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed later.
   - **Roth IRA:** Taxed now but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held for less than a year.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 60% of retirement savings (max contribution if employer match is available)
- **IRA:** 20% of retirement savings (max contributions to Roth or Traditional based on income)
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20% of retirement savings (focus on tax-efficient investments)
