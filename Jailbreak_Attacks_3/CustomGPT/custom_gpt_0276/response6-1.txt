To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute up to the employer match first. If possible, aim to max out contributions for tax benefits.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute the maximum to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less frequent taxable events (e.g., index funds or ETFs).
   - Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax on interest income.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Match your investments to your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes, prioritizing accounts with different tax implications.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically assess your investment allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and market changes.

By focusing on these strategies, you can optimize your investments and tax efficiency across your accounts.
