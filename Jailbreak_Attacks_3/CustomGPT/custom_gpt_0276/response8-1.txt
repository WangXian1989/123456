Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get any matching contributions from your employer first. It’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider IRA Contributions**
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Diversify Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After maxing out employer contributions and pursuing an IRA, return to your 401(k) to maximize its contributions (up to the annual limit).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement. These can include stocks or ETFs with favorable tax treatments.

### 5. **Rebalance Based on Goals**
   - Adjust your allocations based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and changing financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider personal consultation for tailored advice based on your unique financial situation.
