Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a streamlined strategy:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. Itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contributions:** Aim for at least 15% of your salary if your budget allows.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Roth IRA:** If eligible, prioritize this for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Consider if you want to reduce your taxable income now. 

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **After Maxing Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Invest any additional funds here.
   - **Focus on Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **General Tips**
   - **Diversification:** Ensure a well-balanced mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).
   - **Revisit Annually:** Adjust allocations based on performance, goals, and changing circumstances.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k):** 50%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20%
