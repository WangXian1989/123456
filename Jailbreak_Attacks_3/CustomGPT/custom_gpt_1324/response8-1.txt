Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional) next. IRAs often have more investment options and can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

3. **Contribute to 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA, continue making contributions to your 401(k), especially if you have a high income that may lead to reduced tax benefits from a traditional IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings, especially if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. This is useful for short-term goals or if you expect to need liquidity.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, and consider putting higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering risk tolerance and investment horizon.

7. **Adjust for Taxes**: Pay attention to your current tax bracket and potential capital gains taxes when deciding how much to allocate to each account.

Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on life changes, income level, and market conditions. Consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
