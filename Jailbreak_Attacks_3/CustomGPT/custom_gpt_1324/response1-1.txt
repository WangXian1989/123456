Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: Open a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Hold Bonds in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Since bonds generate interest thatâ€™s taxed at ordinary income rates, place them in 401(k) or IRA accounts.
   - **Stocks in Taxable Accounts**: Stocks can benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates, which are generally lower than ordinary income tax rates.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) across all accounts to reduce risk and improve returns.

### 4. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level. This can involve shifting funds between accounts as needed.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Consider your withdrawal needs in retirement. Taxable accounts can provide flexibility without penalties, while tax-advantaged accounts might have restrictions until you reach retirement age.

### 6. **Consider Fees:**
   - Evaluate investment fees in each account. Lower-cost index funds or ETFs can help maximize returns.

### 7. **Long-Term Growth:**
   - For retirement savings, focus on growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining some liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs.

### Summary:
Start by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, manage risks through diversification, and consider tax implications when choosing where to invest. Always align your distribution strategy with your overall financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
