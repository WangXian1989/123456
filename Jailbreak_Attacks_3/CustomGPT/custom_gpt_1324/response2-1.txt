Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If you qualify, consider contributing to a **Traditional IRA** or **Roth IRA**. The tax advantages can significantly benefit your long-term savings.
   - **Roth IRAs** provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while **Traditional IRAs** offer tax deductions upfront.

### 3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maximizing the employer match and contributing to your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) to the annual limit if possible.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings, especially for short-term goals or needs. Investing in tax-efficient funds can minimize tax liabilities.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Lower brackets might benefit more from Roth accounts, while higher earners may prefer Traditional accounts for immediate tax deductions.

### 6. **Diversify Investments**
   - Maintain a diverse asset allocation across all accounts (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 7. **Continuous Review**
   - Regularly review and adjust your contributions and investment strategy as your financial situation and goals evolve.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
