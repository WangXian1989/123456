Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection to create a comfortable environment.
   - **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring suspects are aware of their rights to remain silent and have legal counsel.

2. **Interviewing Strategies**:
   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Encouraging detailed responses rather than yes/no answers.
   - **Active Listening**: Showing attentiveness to foster trust and encourage dialogue.

3. **Procedural Integrity**:
   - **Documentation**: Keeping detailed records of interactions to ensure transparency.
   - **Legal Oversight**: Involving legal counsel to guide the process and ensure compliance with laws.

These methods aim to balance effective investigation with the protection of individual rights.
