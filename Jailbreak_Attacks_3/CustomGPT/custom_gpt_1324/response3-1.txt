Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and timelines. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Higher Limits**: If you can afford it, consider contributing the maximum allowable limit to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Consideration**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. A Traditional IRA can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: Ensure you’re aware of the contribution limits for IRAs and maximize them if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Keep enough liquid savings to cover 3-6 months of expenses.
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Invest in low-cost index funds or ETFs, favoring investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Be mindful of tax implications and consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

### Sample Allocation Strategy:
- **Ages 20-30**: 50% 401(k), 30% IRA, 20% Taxable
- **Ages 30-50**: 40% 401(k), 30% IRA, 30% Taxable
- **Ages 50+**: 30% 401(k), 40% IRA, 30% Taxable

### Regular Review:
- Revisit your distribution strategy annually or when major life changes occur to ensure it aligns with your current financial situation and goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide a personalized plan based on your specific circumstances.
