The best strategy for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First (IRA and 401(k))**:
   - Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA first as they offer tax benefits. Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions may lower your taxable income, while Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Depending on your income, consider whether a traditional or Roth IRA is more beneficial. Roth IRAs are advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Diversify Contributions**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating excess funds to a taxable account. This account provides flexibility for withdrawal but may incur capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Consider Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**: If you expect to accumulate substantial funds in tax-deferred accounts, be mindful of RMDs that start at age 72 for traditional IRAs and 401(k)s. Plan your withdrawals accordingly to manage tax implications.

5. **Assess Investment Options**: Each account may have different investment options. Evaluate where you can access the best investment choices and consider keeping higher-growth investments, like stocks, in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your financial situation changes, regularly review and adjust your contributions among accounts to stay aligned with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances can greatly affect the best allocation strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice to optimize your specific situation.

Lastly, stay informed about tax laws and account limits as they can change over time and impact your strategies.
