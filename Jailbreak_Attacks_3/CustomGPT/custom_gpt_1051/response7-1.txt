It’s essential to recognize that the optimal distribution of your money across retirement accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, investment timeline, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy you may consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: In 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if you are age 50 or older). 

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions with tax-deferred growth) and a Roth IRA (contributions after-tax with tax-free growth). Each has its income limits.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: The contribution limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you are 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investment Strategy**: Consider holding investments that are less tax-efficient, such as stocks (due to lower long-term capital gains tax rates) and avoid holding bonds in taxable accounts, as they are taxed at ordinary income rates.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Taxable accounts can offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, which may be important for short-term goals.

**Distribution Strategy**:
- After maximizing your employer's match in your 401(k), consider focusing on making the maximum contributions to your IRA (especially if it's a Roth). Once those are maxed out, return to contributing to your 401(k) until you hit the annual contribution limits. Afterwards, if you have additional funds, invest in taxable accounts, focusing on strategies to mitigate tax impacts.

This approach balances tax advantages while allowing flexibility for short-term needs and long-term growth.

Additionally, it’s wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan that accurately considers your unique financial situation and goals.
