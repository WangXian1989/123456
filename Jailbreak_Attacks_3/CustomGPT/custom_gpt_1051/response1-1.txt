Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy that could help you optimize your allocation:

### 1. **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

### 2. **Consider your tax bracket:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, benefiting those in higher tax brackets. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Ideal for younger individuals or those currently in lower tax brackets.

### 3. **Stage of life and investment timeline:**
   - In your 20s and 30s, it may be wise to prioritize Roth accounts for tax-free growth. As you near retirement, shift toward more conservative investments and consider tax implications of distributions.

### 4. **Diversification and liquidity:**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Though these don’t have the tax benefits of retirement accounts, they provide liquidity and can be used for short-term goals without penalties. Important for those who might need access to funds before retirement age.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
| Account Type  | % Allocation | Reason                          |
|---------------|--------------|---------------------------------|
| 401(k)        | 20-30%       | Employer match and tax deferral |
| IRA           | 10-20%       | Flexibility and potential tax benefits |
| Taxable Account| 30-50%      | Liquid funds for short-term needs |

### Conclusion:
Always assess your unique circumstances, possibly work with a financial advisor, and periodically review your allocations as your life situation changes. This approach ensures your money works efficiently for both short-term needs and long-term retirement goals.
