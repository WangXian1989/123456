The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), strive to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum limit, especially if there is an employer match. Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be beneficial.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Alternatively, a Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits with potential for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Assess Your Tax Position**: Depending on your current and expected future tax bracket, you may prefer to use a Roth account (taxed now) versus a Traditional account (taxed later). 

4. **Diversification**: Consider how you will allocate investments within each account. Diversifying your investment types (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts can help manage risk.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for savings that you might need to access before retirement age without penalties. Investments in taxable accounts may be more tax-efficient if you hold onto them long-term due to capital gains tax rates being lower than ordinary income tax rates.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how and when you will need to access your funds, as this can affect which account is prioritized. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first may be advantageous due to tax implications of retirement accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust your contributions based on changing financial situations or goals.

It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and ensure you are making the most informed decisions.
