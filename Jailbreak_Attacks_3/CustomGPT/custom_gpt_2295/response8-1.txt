When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money.‚Äù

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After getting the match, focus on tax-advantaged accounts like a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth), potentially leading to greater long-term growth.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, contributing to a Roth IRA might be more beneficial. Conversely, if you anticipate being in a lower bracket, traditional accounts may be advantageous.

4. **Allocate Based on Investment Goals**: Different accounts may serve different purposes:
   - **401(k)**: Focuses on retirement with potential tax advantages.
   - **IRA**: Flexible investment options for retirement savings.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Good for short- to medium-term goals or emergencies, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Rules**: Each account type has different rules regarding withdrawals. Understand when and how you can access your funds without penalties.

6. **Diversify Investments Within Accounts**: Ensure you have a well-diversified portfolio across all account types. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investments and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, seek guidance from a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy to your individual situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy depends on your financial goals, timelines, and tax situation. Always stay informed and adjust your strategy as your circumstances change.
