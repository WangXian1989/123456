To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages, with contributions potentially tax-deductible; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Provide flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

2. **Assess Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to secure any employer matching funds, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA for additional tax benefits.
   - **Allocate Remaining Funds**: Use taxable accounts for investments after maximizing the above accounts. This offers liquidity and investment flexibility.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering factors like risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment options available in each account.
   - Generally, consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

By strategically allocating funds based on these principles, you can optimize your retirement savings and investment growth. It is advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique situation.
