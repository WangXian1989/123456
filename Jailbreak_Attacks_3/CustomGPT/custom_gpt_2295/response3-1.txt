Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional) depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

3. **Analyze Tax Implications**: Understand the tax treatment of your investments. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments. Hold onto investments for more than a year to qualify for lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider placing higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes. More stable investments could reside in taxable accounts.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**: As you prepare for retirement, plan how youâ€™ll withdraw from these accounts. Generally, starting with taxable accounts may be beneficial to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific needs.
