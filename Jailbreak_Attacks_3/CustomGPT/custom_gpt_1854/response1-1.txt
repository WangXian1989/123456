The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**: A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates when choosing between them.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within your accounts, ensure you are diversifying your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.). This helps manage risk.

4. **Prioritize Accounts Based on Tax Efficiency**:
   - Taxable accounts can be used for short-term goals or as an emergency fund since you can withdraw without penalties.
   - Consider placing investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.

5. **Regular Reassessment**: Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust contributions based on market conditions, changes in income, and life events.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: A financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.

It's essential to create a strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals and risk tolerance.
