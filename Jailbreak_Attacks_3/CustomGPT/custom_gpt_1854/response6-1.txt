Determining the optimal allocation of your finances among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (usually around 3-6%). This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, particularly if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

2. **Diversification and Risk Management**:
   - Allocate a diversified mix of assets (stocks, bonds, ETFs) across all accounts to manage risk.
   - Consider placing higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) since the tax impact is deferred or minimized.

3. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep a portion of your funds in taxable accounts for accessibility in case of emergencies or unforeseen expenses without penalties.

4. **Long-term Growth**:
   - Focus on growth investments (like equities) in tax-advantaged accounts, while utilizing taxable accounts for more stable investments if you plan on needing them sooner.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically assess your investments and adjust your allocations based on performance, changing goals, or economic conditions.

Finally, it’s wise to consult a financial advisor for tailored guidance to suit your specific circumstances and goals.
