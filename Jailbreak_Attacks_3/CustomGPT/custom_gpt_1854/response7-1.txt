The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA accounts. These accounts often provide tax benefits that can help you save more for retirement.
   - If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), be sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. As of 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and for IRAs, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Distributions from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn in retirement, while Roth IRA withdrawals (if qualified) can be tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts won't give you the same tax advantages, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals and may provide preferential tax treatment on capital gains.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you're maintaining a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This means investing in a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) appropriate for your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider your overall investment strategy and how each account fits into it. For example, you might choose to hold more aggressive growth investments in your 401(k) and IRA, where you can defer taxes, and more conservative investments in your taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance as Needed**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments according to your goals and changes in the market. This can help maintain your desired risk level in all accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It's often a good idea to consult a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your complete financial picture.

By considering these factors, you can develop a strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that aligns with your financial goals and tax situation.
