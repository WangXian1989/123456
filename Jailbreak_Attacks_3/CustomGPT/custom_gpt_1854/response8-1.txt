When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here's a general framework to help guide your decisions:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) matching contribution, contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute additional funds to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit ($22,500 for those under 50 and $30,000 for those 50 and older for 2023). This allows for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Also consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation. The contribution limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500 ($7,500 if youâ€™re 50 or older).

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth account may be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals. 
   - Conversely, if you believe your taxable income will be lower in retirement, contributing to a Traditional 401(k) or IRA could be advantageous for immediate tax relief.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens, such as index funds or ETFs that have lower turnover rates.
   - Also, consider holding tax-efficient investments that can help mitigate capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation and Diversification**: 
   - Make sure to diversify investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Remember that the same overall portfolio strategy applies to all account types, but the tax implications of each account type should influence asset location (where you hold specific investments).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Think Long-Term**: All of these accounts are for long-term growth, so avoiding withdrawals and allowing your investments to grow can enhance your overall returns.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that considers your entire financial picture, including your risk tolerance, investment goals, and retirement timeline. They can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation and help you navigate any complex tax implications.
