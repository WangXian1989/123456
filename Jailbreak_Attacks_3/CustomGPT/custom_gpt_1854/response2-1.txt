To effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account that may offer matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Individual retirement accounts. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts where you can buy and sell assets without tax-deferred benefits. Taxes are owed on gains and income.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first—this is essentially free money.
   - Next, consider maxing out a Roth IRA if eligible, as it provides tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - If you still have funds to invest, consider filling your 401(k) contributions up to the limit.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - In tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider a mix of growth-oriented investments (stocks) and more stable investments (bonds) based on your risk tolerance.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Think about your retirement withdrawal strategy. Generally, it’s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA), and finally from tax-free accounts (Roth IRA) to maximize tax efficiency.

5. **Rebalance as Necessary**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you’re unsure about your investment strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your financial situation and goals.

By strategically allocating your contributions and managing your investments across these accounts, you can optimize tax benefits and improve your overall retirement savings strategy.
