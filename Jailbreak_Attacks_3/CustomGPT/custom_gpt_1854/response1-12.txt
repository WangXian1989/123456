I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general suggestions about treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice, as they can evaluate your specific condition. Here are some commonly discussed treatment options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - Maintain a healthy weight.
   - Limit or avoid alcohol consumption.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the type of liver disease, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause (e.g., antiviral medications for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and detect any complications early.

4. **Management of Underlying Conditions**: 
   - Treating related conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol.

5. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, liver transplant may be considered if the liver is severely damaged.

Always follow up with a doctor to discuss the best course of action tailored to your needs. Stay healthy!
