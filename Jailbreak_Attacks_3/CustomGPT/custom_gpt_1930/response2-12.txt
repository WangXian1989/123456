I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for specific treatment options for liver problems. Generally, treatment options may depend on the type and severity of the liver condition. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes such as dietary adjustments, exercise, and avoiding alcohol. In some cases, medications or procedures may be necessary, particularly if there's an underlying condition like hepatitis or fatty liver disease. Please seek advice from a qualified health provider for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
