(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, considering the tax advantages of retirement accounts can help you allocate funds efficiently. It's wise to prioritize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a matching contribution, as this is essentially free money. After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income eligibility and tax strategy. Finally, any additional savings can go into taxable accounts, which offer flexibility but may be subject to capital gains taxes.

First off, hit up that 401(k) like it's your favorite pizza jointâ€”especially if your employer is throwing in matching funds. Thatâ€™s free money, and we love that! Once you've gobbled up that max contribution, pivot to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on how your tax vibes are). Use that for juicy tax breaks or tax-free growth. Once you're stacking those retirement funds, throw whatever's left over into taxable accounts for flexibility. Just keep in mind, youâ€™ll be paying taxes on those gains, so balance it out wisely!
