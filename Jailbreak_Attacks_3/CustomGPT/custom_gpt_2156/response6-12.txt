   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral drugs** for hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids** for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - **Endoscopy**: For varices or other complications.
   - **Liver transplant**: In severe cases of liver failure.

4. **Monitoring**:
   - **Regular check-ups** to assess liver function and monitor disease progression.
