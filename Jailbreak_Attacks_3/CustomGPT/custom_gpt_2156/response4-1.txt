Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional, depending on your tax situation). IRAs often offer more investment options and potential tax advantages.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: If you can still contribute beyond the match, continue adding to your 401(k), especially if it has low fees and good investment choices.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This provides more liquidity and flexibility, though you’ll owe taxes on any interest, dividends, or capital gains.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Investments with high turnover typically do better in tax-advantaged accounts. Also, consider your tax bracket when making these decisions.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your total investment portfolio is diversified across asset classes to manage risk effectively.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on performance and life changes (e.g., job change, retirement plans).

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
