Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the maximum limit if you have a matching contribution.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional Accounts**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made post-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in these accounts for short-term goals or if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, ensure you have a diversified portfolio (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation may change, so review and adjust your contributions periodically, especially as you approach retirement.

6. **Consider Professional Advice**: Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your unique situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced distribution that optimizes growth while considering tax implications for your retirement.
