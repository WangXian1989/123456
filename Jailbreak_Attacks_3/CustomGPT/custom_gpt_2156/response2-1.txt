Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (often considered free money). If possible, maximize your contributions to take advantage of tax deferrals.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket when you withdraw funds in retirement; otherwise, a traditional IRA may be more beneficial for current tax deductions.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified. Consider the total portfolio rather than just individual accounts to balance risk.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Allocate investments with higher growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to shelter them from taxes as they grow.
   - Consider placing bonds or income-generating investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends and capital gains.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on performance, changes in your financial situation, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your specific situation.
