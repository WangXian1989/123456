It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding your liver problem. However, general treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and engaging in regular physical activity can support liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or address underlying causes (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Limiting or avoiding alcohol consumption can help prevent further liver damage.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and diagnostic tests can help monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases of liver disease, a transplant may be considered.

Always follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and discuss the most appropriate treatment options for your specific condition.
