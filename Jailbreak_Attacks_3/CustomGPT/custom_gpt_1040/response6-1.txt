When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account several factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Below are some strategies for effective distribution:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA can be beneficial since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

2. **Strategize Taxable Account Investments:**
   - **Capital Gains Management:** Invest in tax-efficient funds or individual stocks that you plan to hold long-term to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Income Investments:** Be mindful of the tax implications of dividends and interest income, as this income is taxed in the year it's received.

3. **Balance Contributions Based on Goals:**
   - **Short-Term Needs vs. Long-Term Growth:** If you anticipate needing funds soon, prioritize your taxable account. For long-term growth, maximize contributions to your 401(k) or IRA.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - **Current vs. Future Tax Rates:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider a Roth IRA. If you expect to be in a lower bracket, a traditional IRA or 401(k) may be more advantageous.

5. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - **Tailored Financial Planning:** A financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation and goals.

By strategically allocating funds across these types of accounts, you can take advantage of tax benefits while working toward your overall financial goals.
