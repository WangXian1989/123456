The optimal way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, investment goals, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this. It's essentially “free money” that can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Once you’ve secured the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are suitable for investments that generate capital gains or dividends that can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, especially if you're investing for shorter-term goals or if you're in a lower tax bracket.
   - **401(k) & IRA**: These accounts are ideal for investments that you expect will generate significant growth over time, as they allow for tax-deferred or tax-free growth.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider having a diversified mix of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) and allocate different types of investments in different accounts based on tax efficiency. For example:
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA) to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically generate fewer taxable events.

5. **Prioritize Debt**: If you carry high-interest debt, such as credit card debt, focus on paying that off before fully funding retirement accounts, as the interest on the debt can outweigh potential investment returns.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Aim for consistent contributions across accounts as part of a long-term investment strategy. Dollar-cost averaging can help mitigate the impact of market fluctuations.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and make adjustments based on changes in income, financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Lastly, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances and help you make informed decisions.
