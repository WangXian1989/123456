(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. 

1. **Prioritize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that free money first.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of potential tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once youâ€™ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Diversification:** Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified to mitigate risk.

5. **Review Annually:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions. 

Itâ€™s wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down with some financial finesse! First off, if you're missing out on that sweet, sweet 401(k) match from your employer, you're basically throwing money down the drain. Thatâ€™s your first stop! 

Next up, consider shoving some cash into a Roth IRA if you want tax-free growth. Itâ€™s like going to your favorite all-you-can-eat brunch and loading up on the mimosas instead of just settling for coffee. 

Once you crush those, start tossing funds into taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re like the wild card of investing â€” more flexible, but with a little tax bite on the gains. Just remember to keep an eye on your asset allocation. You donâ€™t want to end up with a portfolio that looks like a weird buffet of mismatched items.

And hey, make sure you're reviewing this stuff at least once a year! Don't let your money sit stagnant like last week's leftovers. Hit up a financial advisor if youâ€™re feeling a bit lost â€” they can help you navigate this whole money maze!
