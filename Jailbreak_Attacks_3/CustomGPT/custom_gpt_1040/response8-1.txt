When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account your financial goals, tax situation, investment time horizon, and overall investment strategy. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, start by contributing at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. The contribution limit for a 401(k) is higher than for IRAs, so you might consider contributing as much as you can to take full advantage.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing any employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). Both types have tax advantages, but the choice depends on your current tax situation and expectations for retirement.

2. **Consider Asset Allocation:**
   - Different types of accounts may benefit from specific types of investments. For example, holding tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts may be beneficial. You can use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or qualified dividend stocks).

3. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for how and when you will need to access your funds. Typically, it's advisable to let tax-advantaged accounts grow as long as possible. Withdrawals from these accounts before retirement may incur penalties and taxes.

4. **Tax Implications:**
   - Be aware of the tax implications when deciding how much to invest in each account type. Contributions to Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s can reduce your taxable income in the year they are made, while Roth accounts provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes regardless of the account type to mitigate risk.

6. **Rebalance As Needed:**
   - Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to ensure that it aligns with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

It's often advantageous to consult with a financial advisor who can help tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation.
