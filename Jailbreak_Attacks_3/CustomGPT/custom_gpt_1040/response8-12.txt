I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. However, general treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can be crucial for liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of liver function through blood tests and imaging studies can help track the progression of liver disease.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical interventions such as liver transplantation may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: Some people find liver-supportive supplements beneficial, but it's crucial to discuss these with a healthcare provider.

Please reach out to your doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan that suits your needs.
