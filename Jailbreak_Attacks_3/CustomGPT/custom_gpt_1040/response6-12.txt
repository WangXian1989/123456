I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. Some common treatments for liver issues may include:

- **Lifestyle Changes:** Adopting a healthier diet, exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
- **Medications:** Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying issues. 

Always seek professional medical advice for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
