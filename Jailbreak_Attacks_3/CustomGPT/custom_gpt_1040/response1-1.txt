When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize your long-term financial health:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions, which is essentially free money. Prioritize contributing enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages. You can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible but donâ€™t have the same tax advantages. Suitable for short-term goals or saving for goals that might not align with retirement.

2. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - **Start with the 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is a smart investment as it's a guaranteed return.
   - **Fund Your IRA**: Once you're maximizing your employer match, contribute to an IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds before retirement.

3. **Assess Contribution Limits**: 
   - For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). 
   - For an IRA, the maximum contribution is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older). 

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Regardless of account type, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) to manage risk. Your risk tolerance and time horizon will help determine your asset allocation.

5. **Consider the Timing of Withdrawals**: 
   - Understand the tax implications when you withdraw from each account type. Taxable accounts may allow for more favorable capital gains treatment, while withdrawals from traditional IRAs or 401(k)s can be taxed as ordinary income.

6. **Review Regularly**: 
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and make adjustments based on performance, changing financial goals, and market conditions. 

Consulting with a financial advisor is also a good idea as they can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific circumstances and goals.
