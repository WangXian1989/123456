Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it allows tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional Accounts**: 401(k) and traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now, but withdrawals are taxed as income later. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends can be taxed now, but you have more flexibility with withdrawals.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth. Use a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Similar to the 401(k), but consider including more aggressive assets if you can handle the risk.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize tax-efficient investments (like index funds) and consider holding assets for over a year to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

4. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your allocations regularly or when significant financial changes occur.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
