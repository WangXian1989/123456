I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or inflammation.

3. **Interventional Procedures**: In some cases, procedures such as endoscopy may be necessary to address complications like varices.

4. **Surgery**: For severe liver disease or tumors, surgical options may be considered.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In advanced cases of liver failure, a transplant may be the only option.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
