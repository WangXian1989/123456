I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for the best treatment options for your liver problem. Treatment can vary widely depending on the specific liver condition, its severity, and your overall health. Some general treatment options that doctors might consider include:

1. **Medication**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants for autoimmune liver diseases.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Avoiding alcohol and substances that can further damage the liver.
   - Maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - Regular monitoring and imaging tests to assess liver health.
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be considered.

4. **Supportive Care**:
   - Regular check-ups and treatment for any underlying conditions, such as diabetes or high cholesterol.

Always follow the advice of your healthcare provider for the most appropriate treatment based on your particular medical situation.
