To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following tips:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: Offers pre-tax contributions and possibly an employer match. Focus on maxing out contributions to benefit from tax deferrals and employer matching.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax). Consider your current tax bracket and whether you anticipate being in a higher bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Provide flexibility with withdrawals but are subject to capital gains tax. Use this for short-term goals or liquid investments.

### 2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Consider Your Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors can afford to take more risks with stocks in retirement accounts, while those nearing retirement may prefer more stable investments.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Allocate different asset classes (stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents) to spread risk.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Consider IRAs**: If you max out your 401(k), look into IRAs for additional tax-advantaged savings.
   - **Fill Taxable Accounts Last**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
| Account Type    | Intended Contribution |
|------------------|---------------------|
| 401(k)           | Max to employer match (e.g., up to 6% of salary) |
| IRA              | Maximum allowable annual contribution (e.g., $6,000 or $7,000 if over 50) |
| Taxable Account   | Remaining funds after maximizing 401(k) and IRA |

Make sure to regularly review and adjust your strategy based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.
