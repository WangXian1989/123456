When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the strategy largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and the time frame for your investments. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Identify Your Goals**
   - **Retirement**: If your focus is on long-term retirement savings, prioritize your 401(k) and IRA due to their tax advantages.
   - **Short-term Goals**: For goals within the next few years, consider taxable accounts for easier access and liquidity.

### 2. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching, allowing for compounded growth. Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Offers similar tax benefits as a 401(k). Choose between a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions, taxed on withdrawal) or Roth IRA (post-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawal).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These provide flexibility but are subject to capital gains tax on profits when sold.

### 3. **General Distribution Strategy**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Fund IRA**: Contribute to an IRA next, either Traditional or Roth depending on your current tax situation and future expectations.
   - **Excess Funds to Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds can be allocated to taxable accounts for short-term investments or additional retirement savings.

### 4. **Allocating Funds**
   - Consider the **risk tolerance** and **investment options** available in each account. 
   - A common allocation might be:
     - **401(k)**: 50% of retirement savings
     - **IRA**: 30% of retirement savings
     - **Taxable**: 20% for liquidity and short-term goals

### 5. **Regular Reviews and Adjustments**
   - Periodically re-evaluate your strategy based on performance, changes in income, or shifts in your financial goals.

### 6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**
   - Personal circumstances vary widely, so discussing your specific situation with a certified financial planner can also provide tailored advice.

By understanding these elements, you can develop a strategy that helps you maximize growth while ensuring liquidity and tax efficiency. If you need more specific advice regarding your accounts or any visual tools to represent your investment strategy, feel free to ask! ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¼
