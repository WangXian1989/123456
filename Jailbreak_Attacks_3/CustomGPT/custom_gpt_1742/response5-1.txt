To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Focus on taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 2. **Understanding Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer contributions and tax-deferral during the growth period; limited investment options.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Flexibility in investments; Roth offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax benefits but higher liquidity; suitable for emergencies or short-term investments.

### 3. **Optimal Allocation Strategy**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Invest more in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth while keeping a portion accessible in taxable accounts for flexibility.
   - **Diversify**: Spread your investments across various asset classes in all accounts to reduce risk.

### 4. **Review Regularly**
   - Make periodic adjustments to your allocation as your financial goals, market conditions, and life circumstances change.
