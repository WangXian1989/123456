I'm glad you're thinking about how to manage your investments! Here's a simple way to think about it:

1. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match. It’s free money!

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After your 401(k), consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your income and tax situation). This provides tax advantages and more investment options.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings and investments once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility, but remember you’ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Review Periodically**: Regularly check your contributions and investment performance, adjusting as needed based on your financial goals.

It’s always good to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific needs!
