Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. They offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be useful for shorter-term goals.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compounding. For taxable accounts, utilize tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes to balance risk and return.

6. **Re-evaluate Regularly**: Keep an eye on your investments and adjust as necessary based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.
