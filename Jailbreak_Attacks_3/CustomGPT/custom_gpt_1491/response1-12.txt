I'm not a doctor, but itâ€™s important to consult with a healthcare professional for liver issues. Common options can include lifestyle changes, medication, or even specific treatments depending on the condition. Eating a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and regular check-ups can help. Always best to get tailored advice from a medical expert though!
