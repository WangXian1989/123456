Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**  
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money!
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**  
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These may have capital gains taxes. Consider using them for investments that generate qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**  
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs before maxing out retirement accounts.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**  
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.
   - Consider different asset allocations depending on the account type and your time horizon.

Remember, the specifics can vary based on your individual situation, so consider discussing with a financial advisor for tailored advice!
