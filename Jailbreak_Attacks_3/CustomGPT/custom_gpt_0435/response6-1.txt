Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations related to tax implications, investment growth potential, and liquidity. Hereâ€™s how you can approach this strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible, especially if you are in your peak earning years.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. Traditional IRAs can lower your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal.

2. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Consider maintaining some funds in a taxable account for greater access to your money without the penalties associated with early withdrawal from retirement accounts.
   - Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for financial needs, as you can withdraw capital gains or dividends without restrictions imposed by retirement accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Ensure that within each account type, you are diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk and enhance growth potential.
   - Consider asset location strategies: for instance, place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Annual Review**: 
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on market performance and changes to your financial situation or retirement goals to optimize your strategy continually.

By considering these factors, you can develop a distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals and maximizes your investment's growth potential while minimizing taxes.
