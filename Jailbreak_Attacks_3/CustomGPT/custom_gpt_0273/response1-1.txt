Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Good if you want upfront tax deductions. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.

### 3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maxing out the match, consider increasing your contributions to the 401(k).

### 4. **Fund Taxable Accounts**
   - If you've maxed out retirement accounts, allocate extra funds to a taxable account for flexibility and liquidity.

### 5. **Consider Investment Options**
   - Ensure you're diversified across asset classes in each account type.

### 6. **Tax Considerations**
   - Be mindful of the tax implications for capital gains in taxable accounts and distributions from retirement accounts.

### 7. **Adjust Based on Life Stage**
   - Younger investors might focus more on growth (stocks), while those nearing retirement may prioritize stability (bonds).

### Conclusion
Balance contributions based on tax benefits, matching contributions, and your long-term financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies.
