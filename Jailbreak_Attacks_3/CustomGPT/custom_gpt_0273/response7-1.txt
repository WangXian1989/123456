Distributing your money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can maximize growth and minimize taxes. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. 

### 2. **Investment Allocation:**
   - **401(k):** Focus on a diverse mix of stocks and bonds according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA:** Choose investments that align with your long-term goals. If you have a Roth IRA, tax-free growth is a significant advantage.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient vehicles (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding bonds or high-yield assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Place higher-growth investments in your tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - Use your taxable account for investments that generate lower taxable income, such as qualified dividends or investments that benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Review Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and market changes.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** 15% (enough to maximize employer match)
- **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA:** 10% (based on contribution limits)
- **Taxable Account:** Remainder of your budget allocated for investments.

### Conclusion
Tailor these allocations based on your financial situation, goals, and expected retirement timeline. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
