Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money).
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA for tax advantages.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Taxed on capital gains and dividends; consider keeping investments that generate high tax liabilities here.

### 3. **Investment Goals:**
   - For long-term growth, favor equities in tax-advantaged accounts. 
   - Consider fixed income in taxable accounts to manage tax impacts.

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have enough liquid savings outside of these investments for unexpected expenses.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Maintain a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### 6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
