Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

- **401(k):**
  - Maximize employer match if available.
  - Higher contribution limits; consider contributing enough to get the full match.
  - Invest in funds with lower fees.

- **IRA (Traditional/Roth):**
  - Aim to max out contributions if possible (for 2023: $6,500, or $7,500 if over age 50).
  - Choose Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; Traditional if you want tax deductions now.

- **Taxable Accounts:**
  - Useful for short-term goals and liquidity.
  - Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.
  - Consider the tax implications of selling investments, especially for higher-income brackets.

**General Strategy:**
- Prioritize contributions in the following order: 401(k) (to match), then IRA, then taxable accounts.
- Rebalance regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.

Always remember to review your financial goals and adjust your distributions as needed.
