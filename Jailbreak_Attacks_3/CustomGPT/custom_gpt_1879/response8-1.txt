The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach to consider:

- **Maximize employer match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as it's essentially free money.
- **Contribute to IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Max out 401(k)**: After maximizing the employer match, consider increasing contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
- **Taxable accounts**: Use these for additional savings once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out, focusing on investments with favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains).
- **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced mix of asset classes across all accounts to manage risk.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation is always beneficial.
