To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

- **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**:
  - Contribute up to your employer's match in your 401(k) to take advantage of "free" money.
  - Aim to max out your IRA contributions (both Traditional and Roth if eligible), as these accounts offer significant tax benefits.

- **Assess your investment goals and timeline**:
  - Short-term vs. long-term: Allocate more towards tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
  - Risk tolerance: Balance more volatile investments in accounts where withdrawals will be later (e.g., 401(k) and IRA) and consider more stable investments in taxable accounts.

- **Consider withdrawal periods**:
  - Taxable accounts may be ideal for shorter-term goals since they offer greater flexibility and no penalties for early withdrawals.
  - 401(k) and IRA funds are best for long-term growth due to tax deferral benefits, which compound your investment over time.

- **Tax implications**: 
  - Be mindful of taxes on capital gains in taxable accounts, and strategize withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income during retirement.
