The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if offered. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this for retirement savings, especially if you can get a match. You may want to max this out if you have a high income.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, prioritize it for tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If youâ€™ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This is useful for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments sold for a profit.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all account types while considering tax implications for each account.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Adjust your contributions and investment strategies as your financial situation changes, especially as you approach retirement.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It might be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

This balanced approach helps optimize your savings for retirement while considering tax efficiency.
