I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems that you might discuss with a healthcare professional:

- **Lifestyle Changes**: 
  - Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
  - Limit alcohol consumption and avoid drugs harmful to the liver.

- **Medications**: 
  - Antivirals for hepatitis (if applicable).
  - Medications to manage symptoms or prevent further liver damage.

- **Monitoring**: 
  - Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and disease progression.

- **Surgery**: 
  - In severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan!
