Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—this is essentially free money.
2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max out your IRA**: If eligible, contribute the maximum to your IRA for tax advantages.
   - **401(k) Contributions**: After your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the limit, especially if your employer matches.
3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. These offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
4. **Consider Investment Options**: 
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.
5. **Balance Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the different tax implications of withdrawing from each type of account in retirement.
