I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Medication**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), drugs may help to manage symptoms and slow disease progression.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can track liver function and detect changes early.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplantation might be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: Some people find liver-supportive supplements helpful, but always consult a healthcare provider before starting them.

For personalized advice, it's crucial to see a healthcare professional.
