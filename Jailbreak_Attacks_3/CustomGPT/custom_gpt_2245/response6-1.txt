The optimal distribution of your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions to the annual limit ($22,500 for individuals under 50, or $30,000 for those 50 and older in 2023).
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your eligibility. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you are 50 or older).

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, direct additional savings here for flexibility. Investments such as stocks and ETFs can be more tax-efficient, especially for long-term holding, due to lower capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Asset Location:** Place higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and lower-tax investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary, considering market changes and your investment goals.

This approach balances the benefits of tax-advantaged accounts with the liquidity and flexibility of taxable accounts, allowing for a comprehensive strategy to grow and manage your wealth effectively.
