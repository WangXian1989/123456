The optimal distribution of your funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here is a general strategy:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) if it offers employer matching, as this is effectively "free money." Contribute enough to receive the full match before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth), depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Funds can be directed into taxable investment accounts once contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts are maximized. Taxable accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and investing but are subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investment strategy aligns across all accounts. Consider placing higher-growth, more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth, while more stable investments may be suited for taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Rebalancing and Withdrawal Strategy**: Continually rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and develop a tax-efficient withdrawal strategy in retirement, withdrawing from different accounts based on your tax situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor may provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
