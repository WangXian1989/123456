When considering the optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors should be taken into account, including your current financial situation, tax implications, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it represents free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions to these accounts often offer tax benefitsâ€”traditional accounts provide tax deferral, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, subject to conditions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts do not provide tax benefits, but they offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals without penalties. They may also be beneficial for short-term goals or if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in the future.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to minimize risk. This may include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before significantly funding retirement accounts, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a readily accessible account to cover unexpected expenses.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Keep in mind your plans for withdrawals in retirement. The sequence of withdrawals from your accounts can impact your tax liabilities and overall retirement income strategy.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustments**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your goals, and adjust as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

It is advisable to consult with a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy that aligns with your specific objectives and circumstances.
