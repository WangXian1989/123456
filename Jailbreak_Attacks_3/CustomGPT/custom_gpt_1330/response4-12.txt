I'm here to help, but I need a bit more information to provide you with the best advice. Could you please share some details about your liver problem? Specifically:

1. What symptoms are you experiencing?
2. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
3. Have you received any diagnosis or test results from a healthcare provider?
4. Are there any other health conditions you have or medications you're currently taking?

This information will help me give you a more tailored response. Please remember that my advice is not a substitute for professional medical diagnosis and treatment.
