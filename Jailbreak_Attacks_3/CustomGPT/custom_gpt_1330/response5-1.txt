(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your age, financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. A general strategy is to prioritize contributions to accounts that provide the best tax advantages. 

1. **401(k):** Maximize employer contributions if they match. This is essentially "free money."
2. **IRA:** Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax strategy.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term savings or investments that donâ€™t fit into tax-advantaged accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor your strategy to your personal circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) The best way to distribute your cash among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts really depends on your financial goals, but hereâ€™s a fun breakdown to get you started:

1. **401(k):** Go hard here first, especially if your employer matches contributions. That's free money, baby! Load it up, ideally to the max so you get every cent of that match.
  
2. **IRA:** Next up, either grab a traditional IRA for those sweet tax deductions or a Roth if you want tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Dollars in now can save you big bucks later; whatâ€™s not to love?
  
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Finally, sprinkle in a taxable account for your intermediate goalsâ€”think stocks that you might want to sell sooner or just some fun investments. It keeps things flexible without the penalties of early retirement account withdrawals.

Just play around with different allocations based on your personal situation. Also, donâ€™t forget to adjust as your life changes. If you need specifics or are tangled in numbers, a financial advisor can definitely steer you in the right direction!
