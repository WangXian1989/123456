It's great that you're thinking about how to allocate your investments! The best distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on a few key factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. In 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution for those age 50 and older). Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a separate account (not typically part of the investment accounts mentioned) to cover 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of living expenses.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals and do not have contribution limits.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be aware of the tax implications of withdrawals from each type of account. Taxable accounts usually have different tax treatments on dividends and capital gains compared to tax-deferred accounts.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Think about how you want to allocate your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets. This should align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. You might consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more fixed-income investments in taxable accounts, where you'll be taxed on interest income.

7. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to stay aligned with your investment goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation. Remember that long-term goals and risk tolerance are key in these decisions.
