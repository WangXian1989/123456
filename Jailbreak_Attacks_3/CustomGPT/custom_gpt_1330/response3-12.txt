To provide you with the best treatment options for your liver problem, I would need some more information about your specific condition. Here are some questions to consider:

1. What specific liver problem have you been diagnosed with (e.g., fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis)?
2. What symptoms are you experiencing (e.g., fatigue, jaundice, pain)?
3. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
4. Have you undergone any medical treatments or lifestyle changes so far?
5. Do you have any other underlying health conditions or take medications?

Your answers will help me give you a more tailored response regarding potential treatment options. However, remember to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice.
