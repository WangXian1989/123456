Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts greatly depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Emergency Savings**: Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund with 3-6 months' worth of expenses.

2. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great start.

3. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth might be more beneficial.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can be useful for funds you may need access to before retirement, as they don’t have the same withdrawal restrictions. Capital gains taxes apply here, so consider investing in tax-efficient funds.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, younger investors can take on more risk, while those closer to retirement may want to shift to more conservative investments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For a tailored strategy considering your overall financial picture, consulting a certified financial planner would be wise.

Remember that it’s important to review and adjust your strategy over time as your financial needs and market conditions change.
