To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Familiarize yourself with the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may also be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed similarly to a 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are typically tax-free in retirement. 

4. **Investment Strategy**: Invest more aggressively in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) since these accounts typically benefit from tax-deferral or tax-free growth. In taxable accounts, consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

6. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments among asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and within each account, keeping in mind the risk tolerance and time horizon for each account's use.

7. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that fits your precise financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts while maximizing growth and minimizing tax liabilities.
