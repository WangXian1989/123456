To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Prioritize maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA as these accounts offer tax benefits. 
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments that are expected to generate income, as this can allow you to manage your tax liability more strategically.

2. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Consider a diversified portfolio that spreads risk across different asset classes, adjusting your allocations based on the account type. 
   - **Growth vs. Income:** Place higher growth investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred (or tax-free, in the case of Roth IRAs) growth, while keeping lower-growth or income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy (for later years):**
   - **Tax-Efficient Withdrawals:** Plan your withdrawals in retirement to minimize tax impact, such as waiting until you are in a lower tax bracket before taking distributions from your 401(k) or traditional IRA.

4. **Monitoring and Adjusting:**
   - **Regular Reviews:** Periodically review your investment performance and adjust your strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, or life circumstances.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that takes into account your specific financial situation and goals.
