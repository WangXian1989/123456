The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it first. This is essentially free money.
   - Contribute up to the annual limit (check the current IRS limits) to maximize tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If youâ€™re eligible, consider making contributions to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. This depends on your income level and whether you want tax deductions now (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth).
   - Max out your IRA contributions, as they can provide tax advantages and growth potential.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may want to access before retirement without penalties.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk and potential returns.
   - Regularly reassess your asset allocation based on age, risk tolerance, and market conditions.
   - Remember to factor in taxes when selling assets in taxable accounts. Long-term capital gains are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For a tailored approach, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor who can provide insights specific to your financial situation and goals.

By strategically distributing your contributions, you can optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency.
