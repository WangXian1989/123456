Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, investment goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Here is a general approach you can take:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially "free money" for your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your employer's match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Depending on your income level, you can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) based on your tax situation.

3. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: Before putting too much into investments, consider paying off any high-interest debt, such as credit cards. The interest paid on debt can often exceed potential investment returns.

4. **Taxable Investment Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. These are useful for short- and medium-term financial goals. You can also take advantage of tax efficiency by investing in index funds or ETFs that minimize capital gains distributions.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA). If you expect to be in a lower bracket, favor Roth accounts for their tax-free growth and withdrawals.

6. **Diversification**: Across all accounts, aim for diversification in your investments to manage risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets, tailored to your risk tolerance and investment time horizon.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment strategy and goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategy for your personal situation, it may be beneficial to consult with a certified financial planner or advisor for personalized guidance.

Remember that everyone's situation is different, so consider your unique financial picture when making decisions about investments.
