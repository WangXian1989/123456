Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and should be your first priority.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), but you may be eligible for tax deductions based on income and participation in an employer-sponsored plan.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, and qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here can be subject to capital gains tax. This might be a good place for investments that you intend to hold for the long term, as long-term capital gains are generally taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Investment Goals and Timeline**:
   - If you're younger and far from retirement, consider putting more into growth-focused investments in a Roth IRA or a taxable account to take advantage of tax-free growth.
   - As you get closer to retirement, you might shift a larger portion into safer investments within your 401(k) or IRA to preserve capital.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are well diversified to mitigate risk. This includes diversifying asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) as well as geographical regions and sectors.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you intend to withdraw from these accounts in retirement. A common strategy is to withdraw from taxable accounts first (to minimize tax liabilities), followed by tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA), and lastly, tax-free accounts (Roth IRA).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As markets change and your personal situation evolves, make sure to regularly review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax implications and investment strategies, consider seeking support from a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your unique circumstances, including your income, tax status, and retirement goal timelines.
