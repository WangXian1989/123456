When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider several factors, including your current age, retirement goals, and tax situation. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Max out your contributions up to the limit if you can. Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. Consider if your employer offers a Roth option if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth depending on your income level and retirement strategy). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. These accounts provide flexibility and can be useful for accessing funds before retirement without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments within each account type. Balance your portfolio according to your risk tolerance—consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and investment performance. Rebalance as needed to ensure that your portfolio aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Depending on your financial situation, a consultation with a financial advisor could provide personalized advice tailored to your needs.

Remember, these decisions should align with your financial goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. It’s always a good idea to conduct thorough research or seek professional advice tailored to your unique circumstances.
