To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Start by maximizing your contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Generally, in 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're over 50.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If eligible, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The contribution limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500, or $7,500 for those over 50. If you are over the income limits for a Roth, consider a traditional IRA, bearing in mind the potential for taxes on withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, any additional savings can be directed to a taxable account. This offers flexibility since contributions are not limited, and you can access your funds without penalty. 

4. **Investment Strategy**: Within each account, focus on tax-efficient investments:
   - **Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA)**: Consider holding investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in these accounts.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Utilize tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically generate fewer capital gains distributions, or hold stocks that qualify for long-term capital gains tax rates.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities and personal nature of investing and taxes, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your individual financial goals and circumstances.

The optimal distribution will depend on your income, tax situation, and retirement goals, so it's crucial to factor those elements into your planning.
