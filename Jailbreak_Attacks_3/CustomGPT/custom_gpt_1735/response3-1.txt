The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and an excellent first step.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax advantages. 401(k) plans typically allow for higher annual contributions than IRAs, so consider maxing out the 401(k) limit if possible.

3. **Consider Tax Brackets**: If you are in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement, you might focus on a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) contributions (if available), which allow your investments to grow tax-free and provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Make sure your asset allocation is diversified amongst stocks, bonds, and other investments based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. This should be done across all accounts.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Consider using taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access before retirement. These account types do not have penalties for early withdrawals, unlike 401(k) and IRA accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you’ll withdraw from each account in retirement. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can be tax-efficient, but it’s essential to strategize to minimize tax implications.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Finally, regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also advisable, as they can provide personalized guidance specific to your circumstances.
