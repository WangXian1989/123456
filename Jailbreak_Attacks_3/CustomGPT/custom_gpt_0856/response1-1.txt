To effectively distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute up to that amount first. Then, consider maxing out your IRA.
   - **Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA:** Choose based on your current tax situation. A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Narrowing Down Contributions:**
   - **401(k) for High Earners:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider maximizing your 401(k) contributions, as they reduce taxable income now.
   - **IRA for Flexibility:** If you might need access to your funds before retirement, consider a Roth IRA, as contributions can be withdrawn tax-free.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments. They provide flexibility and liquidity but come with capital gains taxes.

5. **Investment Strategy:** Diversify your investments within each account type based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals.

6. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as necessary based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.
