Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it’s essentially free money. Next, aim to max out contributions if possible (the contribution limit for 2024 is $23,000 for those under 50, and $30,500 for those 50 and older).
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify based on income limitations. For 2024, you can contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may produce a lot of taxable income, like bonds or certain mutual funds. You might also consider holding long-term investments that qualify for capital gains tax treatment.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account, adjusting based on risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Generally, more aggressive investments (higher stocks) are suited for accounts with potential tax advantages, while more conservative investments can be kept in taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your asset allocation as market conditions change and as you get closer to retirement.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation and to help navigate complex tax implications.

This approach balances growth, tax efficiency, and access to funds based on your individual financial situation.
