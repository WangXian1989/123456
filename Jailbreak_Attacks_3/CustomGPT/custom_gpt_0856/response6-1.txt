Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Contribute enough to meet any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for potential immediate tax deductions.

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for more flexible investments without the contribution limits of retirement accounts. They can be useful for shorter-term goals or emergency funds.
   - **Asset Location Strategies:** Place investments that generate a lot of taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep stocks in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

3. **Goal-Based Allocation:**
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Focus on maxing out retirement accounts to benefit from compounded growth and tax advantages.

4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure a well-rounded mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation as your financial situation or goals evolve.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances.
