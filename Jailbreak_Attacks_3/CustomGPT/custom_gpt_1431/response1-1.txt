When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max out the 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any company match, which is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: If possible, max out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) after hitting the 401(k) match. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. Use this for more flexible investment options and easy access to funds without penalties.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Higher earners might benefit from traditional accounts to lower their taxable income, while lower earners could benefit from Roth accounts to enjoy tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where you can defer or avoid taxes. Keep more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts since you're taxed on bond interest.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly evaluate your investment allocations and adjust as needed based on performance, changing goals, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If youâ€™re unsure of the best strategy for your specific situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Remember, the best approach can vary based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline for retirement.
