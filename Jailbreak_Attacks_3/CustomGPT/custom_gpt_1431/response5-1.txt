(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, it can be advantageous to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Hereâ€™s a general approach you might consider:

1. Max out your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if they offer a match, as this is essentially free money.
2. Contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation) to take advantage of additional tax benefits.
3. After fulfilling contributions to these tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating any remaining funds to your taxable accounts.

It's essential to revisit your asset allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial objectives.

1. **401(k) First**: Stuff as much money as you can into that 401(k) if your employer is matching your contributions! Seriously, thatâ€™s free cash â€“ donâ€™t leave it on the table! Youâ€™re basically handing your future self a fat paycheck!

2. **IRA Time**: Next, dive into either a Traditional or a Roth IRA. If youâ€™re looking at tax breaks now, go Traditional, but if you want tax-free growth in retirement, lean towards Roth. Just donâ€™t forget the income limits on those bad boys.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA, then splurge a bit on your taxable accounts. Maybe you want to trade some stocks or invest in mutual funds? Just be mindful of taxes on capital gains, because Uncle Sam loves his cut.

Remember, keep an eye on your investments and adjust as life changes. Your future self will thank you for being a money wizard! ðŸ¤‘
