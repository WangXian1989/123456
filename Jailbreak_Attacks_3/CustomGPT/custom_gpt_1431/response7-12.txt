I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver issues. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan. Treatment options may vary depending on the specific liver problem (such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.). Common treatments may include lifestyle changes, such as dietary adjustments and exercise, medications to manage symptoms or underlying causes, and in severe cases, procedures or surgery. Always seek guidance from a qualified healthcare provider for the best course of action for your specific condition.
