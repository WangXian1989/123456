The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match firstâ€”this is essentially free money. Consider contributing the maximum if you can afford it, as contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

2. **Consider Taxable Accounts**:
   - If you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions and still have additional funds to invest, a taxable account can be a good option. You can invest without contribution limits, and you'll have flexibility for withdrawals.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize capital gains tax.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, more aggressive investments can be held in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments can go into taxable accounts.

4. **Adjust for Tax Implications**:
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of your investment choices. For example, high-yield investments (which generate taxable income) are often better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while low-turnover investments (long-term holdings) may perform well in taxable accounts.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Monitor your investments periodically and adjust your contributions and asset allocation as needed based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances, ensuring you're making the most informed decisions.
