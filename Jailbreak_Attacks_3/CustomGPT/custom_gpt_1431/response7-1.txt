(Î±) When determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. A common approach is to maximize your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Start with your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Then, consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax benefits. If you're maxing out these accounts and have more money to invest, you can allocate funds to a taxable account for flexibility. Diversifying your investments across all these accounts can help balance growth and tax efficiency.
