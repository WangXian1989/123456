I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with liver issues. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options. However, I can provide some general information on common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can significantly impact liver health.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups with a healthcare provider can help monitor liver function and progression of any disease.

4. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgical interventions may be necessary, such as a liver transplant for severe liver disease.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore herbal supplements or alternative therapies, but it's crucial to discuss these with a healthcare provider, as they can interact with standard treatments.

Always consult with a medical professional to determine the best treatment plan for your specific liver condition.
