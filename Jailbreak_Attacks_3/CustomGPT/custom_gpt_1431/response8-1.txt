Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Your investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions can be tax-deductible or grow tax-free (Roth) when certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t offer tax advantages, but you can withdraw funds at any time without penalties, allowing for greater flexibility.

3. **Balance Contributions**:
   - If you’re under 50, the maximum contributions are $19,500 for a 401(k), $6,000 for an IRA (Traditional or Roth), and no limits for taxable accounts.
   - If you’re 50 or older, these limits are higher.

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**:
   - Keep enough cash in a savings or taxable account to cover 3-6 months of expenses for emergencies.
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals since they provide liquidity.

5. **Long-Term Investments**:
   - Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth as they provide tax benefits that can compound over time.

6. **Tax Diversification**:
   - Aim to have a mix of tax-deferred (401(k)), tax-free (Roth IRA), and taxable accounts. This strategy provides flexibility in retirement to manage tax liabilities effectively.

7. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement plans.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking to a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy aligns with your individual financial goals and circumstances.
