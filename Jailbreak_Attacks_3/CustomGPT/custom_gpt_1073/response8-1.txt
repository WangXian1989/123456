Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Contribute to Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If you can, max out your IRA contributions (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, which can be beneficial.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: If you have any funds left after maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, focus on diversifying your investments to balance growth and risk, considering your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s or IRAs) and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

7. **Review Regularly**: Revisit your allocation periodically and adjust based on market conditions, changes in your life circumstances, and financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
