To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if there’s an employer match. This reduces taxable income and allows for tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: Use a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as contributions are made with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free. Traditional IRAs can be beneficial for immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. This is useful for short-term goals or flexibility.

4. **Allocation Strategy**: Balance your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. Typically, you’ll want more aggressive investments in your retirement accounts and consider safer investments in taxable accounts to manage taxes.

5. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
