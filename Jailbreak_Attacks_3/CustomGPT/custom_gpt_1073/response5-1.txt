(üîíNormal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize your contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This also helps to reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs provide tax benefits now but have tax implications later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may need to be accessed before retirement age. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds and ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

Overall, balance your contributions based on your tax strategy and retirement goals.
