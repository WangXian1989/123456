1. **Medication**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications like antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for inflammation may be prescribed.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly benefit liver health.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests are vital to assess the condition and adjust treatment as needed.

4. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but consult a doctor first.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, options like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always follow up with a healthcare provider for tailored advice.
