Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Choose a mix of stock and bond funds based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Type of IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; it allows tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Max Contributions**: Aim to maximize your IRA contributions to benefit from tax advantages.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Similar to your 401(k), diversify your investments based on your risk profile.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing heavily in taxable accounts.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds and ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Withdrawals**: Use taxable accounts for short-term needs since you have more flexibility without penalties.

### General Strategy:
- **Contribute Up to Employer Match**: Prioritize 401(k) contributions up to the match.
- **Maximize IRA Contributions**: Focus on your IRA next for tax advantages.
- **Invest Remaining Funds in Taxable Accounts**: Use what's left to invest in taxable accounts for flexibility.

### Regular Review:
- **Reassess Annually**: Review and adjust your contributions and allocations annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and investment performance.
