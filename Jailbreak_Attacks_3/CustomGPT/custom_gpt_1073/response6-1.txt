Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors to maximize growth and minimize taxes. Here’s an effective strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match; it’s essentially free money. 
   - **Traditional IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement age; they offer more liquidity.
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Invest in low-turnover strategies like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Considerations:
- **Age & Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors may lean more heavily toward growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts, while older investors might allocate more to stable income.
- **Tax Bracket**: Your current and expected future tax brackets can influence where to place assets.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
