Determining the best way to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, depending on your current and expected future tax rates.

2. **Consider tax implications**:
   - Taxable accounts incur capital gains taxes on investments that are sold at a profit. By keeping more growth-oriented investments in tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) or IRA, you can potentially minimize your tax burden.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate regular income (like bonds) to avoid high taxes on capital gains.

3. **Diversify your investments**:
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each type of account to manage risk.

4. **Review your investment goals and time horizon**:
   - If you're saving for retirement and have a long time horizon, lean more heavily into growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - If you need access to funds sooner, prioritize liquid assets in taxable accounts.

5. **Regularly reassess your distribution strategy**:
   - Monitor your investment performance and adjust contributions based on changing financial situations or market conditions.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to meet your financial goals.
