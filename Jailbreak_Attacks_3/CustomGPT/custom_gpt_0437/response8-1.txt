Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially “free money” and a great place to start.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - After maximizing your employer's match, consider funding your IRA (either Traditional or Roth) next. IRAs often have lower fees and more investment options than 401(k)s.

3. **Evaluate Tax Considerations**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which means you won't pay taxes until you withdraw the money.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments may be subject to capital gains taxes, so consider this if you're planning short-term trading.

4. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Within each account, ensure you're diversifying your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation and adapt to changing market conditions or personal circumstances.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies for Retirement**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs to minimize tax liability over time.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Every individual’s situation is unique. Consulting with a financial advisor can help you tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By considering these points, you can create a distribution strategy that works best for your overall financial goals.
