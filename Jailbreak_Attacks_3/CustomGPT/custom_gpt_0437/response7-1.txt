Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This can be beneficial for higher-income earners. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA Options**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, similar to a 401(k), whereas Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are subject to capital gains taxes, but you have the flexibility to withdraw funds without penalties.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, especially if your employer offers a match. Aim to hit the annual contribution limits.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals since they offer more liquidity and access to funds.

### 3. **Risk Tolerance**
   - **Aggressive Growth**: If youâ€™re younger and can afford to take more risk, consider a higher allocation to stocks in your retirement accounts and a balanced approach in taxable accounts.
   - **Conservative Approach**: For those closer to retirement, consider safer investments (bonds, cash equivalents) in retirement accounts while maintaining a balanced portfolio in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different accounts can have different tax implications, so balancing your asset allocation can help you manage overall tax liability.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on your investments' performance, market conditions, and changing financial goals.

### Suggested Order of Contribution:
1. **401(k)** up to the employer match.
2. **IRA/Roth IRA** contributions (up to the limit).
3. **Maximize 401(k)** contributions past the match.
4. **Taxable accounts** for additional savings or investments.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the best distribution depends on your specific financial situation. It can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your circumstances.
