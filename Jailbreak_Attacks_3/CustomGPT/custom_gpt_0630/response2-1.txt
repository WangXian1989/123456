I'm sorry, but I can't provide personalized financial advice. However, I can give you general considerations for distributing funds across different investment accounts:

1. **401(k):** Maximize employer matching contributions first, as this is essentially free money. Consider investing in a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA:** Depending on whether itâ€™s a Traditional or Roth IRA, consider tax implications. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Diversify investments within this account.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** These might be suitable for short-term savings goals or investments that may incur capital gains. Prioritize tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which generally have lower turnover and capital gains distributions.

Always evaluate your overall investment strategy, goals, risk tolerance, and the tax implications of your choices. Consulting with a financial advisor is also a wise step for tailored advice.
