To answer your question, diversifying your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is a prudent strategy. Here's a breakdown of how you might consider allocating funds among these accounts:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Traditional or Roth IRA**: Contribute up to the maximum limit. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer immediate tax benefits.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - **Lower Tax Bracket**: Focus on Roth accounts to take advantage of tax-free growth.
   - **Higher Tax Bracket**: Use Traditional accounts to defer taxes until retirement when you may be in a lower bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) that minimize capital gains.
   - Consider municipal bonds, which are often exempt from federal taxes.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Adjust allocations based on performance.
   - Ensure you're not over-exposed to any one asset class.

By adequately distributing your investments, you can capitalize on the unique tax advantages of each account while remaining flexible in your investment strategy.
