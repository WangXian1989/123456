To properly allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Both accounts are tax-advantaged. Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA are generally pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Consider contributing the maximum amount allowed to these accounts if you are in a higher tax bracket now compared to what you expect in retirement.
   - **Roth Options:** If you're considering a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k), these allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Money in taxable accounts can be more flexible than retirement accounts, but you’ll pay capital gains taxes on any profits. Use these accounts for short-term goals or as a place to invest once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk. 

4. **Emergency Fund:** Before allocating too much to retirement, make sure you have an emergency fund of 3-6 months' worth of expenses in a readily accessible account.

5. **Long-Term Growth:** Typically, it’s advisable to invest more aggressively in your 401(k) and IRA, especially if you have time on your side (younger age), while maintaining a more conservative approach for money in taxable accounts if needed for shorter-term goals.

Lastly, consider talking to a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your financial situation and goals.
