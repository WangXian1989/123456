Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation) to benefit from tax advantages.

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**: 
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions may reduce your taxable income, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement; this is ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged contributions, consider taxable accounts for investments. They offer flexibility for emergencies or early withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Invest Based on Goals**: Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from potential tax-free growth. Use conservative investments in taxable accounts, as they may incur taxes on dividends and capital gains.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure, it’s wise to seek personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, the key is to balance immediate tax benefits with long-term growth and flexibility.
