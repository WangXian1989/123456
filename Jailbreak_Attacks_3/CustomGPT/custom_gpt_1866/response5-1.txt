Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Debt Payoff**:
   - If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before making significant investments.

### 3. **Fund an IRA**:
   - If eligible, max out your IRA (Traditional or Roth), as it offers tax advantages.
   - A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement.

### 4. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 5. **Taxable Accounts for Additional Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for savings or investments not needed for retirement in the short term. They offer more liquidity and flexibility.

### 6. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - Depending on your tax situation, consider placing tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 7. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - Periodically review your financial situation and adjust your contributions based on changes in your income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
