To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match. This is free money and a great start.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional depending on your income and tax situation).

3. **Balance Contributions**: If you're eligible, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, while maintaining contributions to your IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high tax liabilities, like stock investments held for under a year or interest income.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your investment mix (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, distributing assets across accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and adapt to any changes in your financial situation.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for withdrawals in retirement to minimize tax impacts, often starting with taxable accounts before accessing tax-deferred or tax-free accounts.

By following this structured approach, you can take advantage of tax efficiencies and potentially maximize your long-term growth. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
