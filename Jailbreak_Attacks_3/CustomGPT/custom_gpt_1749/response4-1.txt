Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth), focusing on tax advantages.
   - If eligible, choose a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high turnover, such as stocks.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in these accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Reassessment**: Regularly review your allocation as your circumstances change, including age, income, and financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice is also recommended, tailored to your specific situation.
