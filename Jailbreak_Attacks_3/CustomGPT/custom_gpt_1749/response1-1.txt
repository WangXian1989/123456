Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. It's essentially free money!

2. **Prioritize IRA Contributions**: If you can, consider maxing out your IRA next (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). IRAs often have more investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once those are maxed out, you can invest in a taxable account. This gives you more flexibility with withdrawals and investing.

4. **Consider Taxes**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) will tax you upon withdrawal, while Roth IRA lets you withdraw tax-free if conditions are met.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure you’re diversified based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your allocations and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk profile.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to you!
