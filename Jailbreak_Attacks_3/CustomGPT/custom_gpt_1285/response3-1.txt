When determining the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here’s a general guideline to help you decide:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has higher contribution limits and may offer employer matching. Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages either on contributions (traditional IRA) or on withdrawals (Roth IRA). The contribution limits are lower than a 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t have tax advantages, but they offer flexibility regarding withdrawals and investments without penalties.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.
   - Next, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you qualify for a tax deduction with a traditional IRA or prefer tax-free withdrawals with a Roth IRA.

3. **Balance Investments Based on Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts are ideal for investments that may take time to grow, such as stocks, because the tax on gains is deferred (or not applicable in the case of Roth IRAs). 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should generally hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Consider keeping bonds or high-turnover investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

4. **Adjust According to Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you are currently in a lower tax bracket, consider maximizing your Roth IRA contributions, as withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free.
   - In higher tax brackets, it might be more beneficial to contribute to pre-tax accounts like 401(k) and traditional IRAs to lower your taxable income now.

5. **Monitor and Rebalance**: 
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and performance and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Professional advice tailored to your individual financial situation can help you make the most informed decision.

It's crucial to adapt your strategy as your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions change. 

Always remember to do thorough research or consult with a financial planner before making significant investment decisions.
