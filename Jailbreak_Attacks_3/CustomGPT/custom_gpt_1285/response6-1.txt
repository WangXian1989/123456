When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth (account for your income limits and eligibility).

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for funds needed in the short-term. Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.
   - **Asset Location**: Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating assets (like bonds) in your taxable account to achieve tax efficiency.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts to manage risk effectively while keeping an eye on your long-term financial goals.

Balancing these accounts will depend on your unique financial situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
