I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems generally include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a healthy diet low in fat, sugar, and salt.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medication**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues (like antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxins**:
   - Completely abstain from alcohol and limit exposure to harmful substances.

5. **In Severe Cases**:
   - Surgical options or liver transplantation may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for tailored advice and treatment options suited to your specific condition.
