To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, follow these general guidelines:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Offered by employers, often includes employer matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth).
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Allows for tax-advantaged savings; can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax) as well.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Regular investment accounts, where you pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before investing in other accountsâ€”this is essentially "free money."
   - Maximize contributions to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA depending on your tax situation and retirement strategy.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Traditional accounts grow tax-deferred; you'll owe taxes upon withdrawal. Roth accounts grow tax-free but require post-tax contributions.
   - Taxable accounts allow for capital gains to be taxed, but you might benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates after holding investments for over a year.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Diversify your investment options within each account based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Stocks may be better suited for long-term growth in retirement accounts, while safer assets might be appropriate for taxable accounts.

5. **Allocate Based on Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically. You might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Regularly reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider seeking professional advice tailored to your specific situation to optimize your investment strategy.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced strategy for distributing your funds across your retirement and taxable accounts that aligns with your financial goals.
