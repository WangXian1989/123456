Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations to help guide your allocation:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth:** Decide whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred contributions) or Roth IRA (tax-deferred withdrawals) better fits your tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits ($6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and older in 2023).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts provide more access to your investments without penalties, making them suitable for shorter-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in a taxable account.

4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Diversification:** Ensure you have a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to manage risk.
   - **Rebalance:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolios to align with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Individual Goals:**
   - Consider your retirement age, risk tolerance, and any upcoming major expenses (like buying a home or funding education) when deciding how to distribute your contributions.

In general, many financial advisors suggest prioritizing your 401(k) up to the employer match, then maxing out your IRA, and finally investing in taxable accounts as needed to balance your overall investment strategy and liquidity needs. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your approach to your specific situation.
