When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account several factors including your financial goals, time horizon, and tax implications. Here are some general guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with matching contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial because withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you are 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you are 50 or older).

3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**: 
   - If youâ€™re closer to retirement, it may be prudent to allocate more funds to stable, lower-risk investments within your 401(k) or IRA to preserve capital.
   - If you have a longer time frame, you can afford to invest more aggressively in your taxable account as well, which can potentially provide higher returns.

4. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: 
   - Distributions from your 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income in retirement, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes, depending on how long you hold investments before selling.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure you have a diversified portfolio to manage risk. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As markets change and you add money to these accounts, periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain or have complex financial needs, it may be worthwhile to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that fits your goals and situation.

Ultimately, the right distribution will depend on your unique financial situation, goals, and preferences.
