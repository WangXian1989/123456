When considering the best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your financial goals, tax implications, current income, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to maximize the match. This is essentially free money and a great starting point.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income and eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement. 

2. **Assess Your Taxable Income and Investment Goals**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any extra funds to a taxable account. This is more flexible as you can access these funds without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on your gains. Use strategies like tax-loss harvesting to minimize taxes.

3. **Consider Risk and Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments among these accounts based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Stocks can offer growth in retirement accounts, while bonds may be suitable for taxable accounts to manage tax liability.

Here’s how you might allocate:
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income up to the match limit.
- **IRA**: Max out annual contribution.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate excess savings after maxing out retirement accounts.

Review and adjust your distribution strategy regularly to align with changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals. Consulting with a financial advisor may also provide personalized insights tailored to your unique circumstances.
