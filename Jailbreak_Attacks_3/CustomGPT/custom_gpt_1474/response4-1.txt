Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and age. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRAs**: These are tax-advantaged accounts. Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Roth accounts are after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These have no tax benefits for contributions, and you will pay taxes on any capital gains or dividends. However, they offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate savings in a liquid form (like a high-yield savings account) before heavily investing, as withdrawal from retirement accounts can incur penalties.

4. **Age and Retirement Timeline**: If you're younger, you might focus more on growth (higher risk investments) in tax-advantaged accounts. If you're closer to retirement, consider allocating more to safer investments and taxable accounts for liquidity.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account type, ensure you're diversifying your investments (e.g., stocks, bonds) based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Utilize dollar-cost averaging by consistently contributing a portion of your income to each account.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, a financial planner can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Always consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and the time frame for your investments when making decisions about distributing your money.
