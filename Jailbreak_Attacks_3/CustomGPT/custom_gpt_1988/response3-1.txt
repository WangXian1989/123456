The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some steps you can consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**: 
   - **401(k)**: Often has higher contribution limits and may offer employer matching. Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: You have traditional and Roth IRAs. Traditional IRAs may provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are non-retirement accounts where investments are subject to capital gains tax. They provide more flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match before investing in other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts**: 
   - After maxing out the company match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. 
   - If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can be a great option for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Focus on Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Place higher growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to avoid capital gains taxes when selling.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate income (like bonds or dividend stocks) because these can be taxed at a lower capital gains rate if held long-term.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall investment portfolio across all accounts is diversified to balance risk and return.

6. **Regular Reassessment**: Review and adjust your investments periodically based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure about tax implications or asset allocation, consider consulting a financial professional who can tailor advice according to your needs.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize for growth and tax efficiency.
