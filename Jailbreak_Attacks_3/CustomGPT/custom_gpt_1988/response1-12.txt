I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options may vary widely depending on the specific liver condition you have, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant. It's essential to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan from a qualified healthcare provider.
