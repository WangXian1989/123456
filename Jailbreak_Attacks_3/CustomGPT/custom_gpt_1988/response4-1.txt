It's important to consider a strategy for distributing your money among your different types of accounts based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications. Here are some general guidelines you might find helpful:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, it's often advisable to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest and Taxable Accounts**:
   - Any remaining funds can go to a taxable account. Since these accounts do not have tax advantages, it may be beneficial to invest there after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically, you'll want a mix of stocks and bonds appropriate to your age and retirement timeline. Consider more aggressive investments (like stocks) while you're younger and gradually shift to bonds as you approach retirement.
   - **IRA**: The investments here should also reflect your long-term goals. Many people prefer to hold more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on potential growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be used for investments that may generate taxable income, such as bonds or dividend-paying stocks, keeping in mind the tax implications of selling assets.

4. **Consider Fees and Investment Choices**:
   - Be aware of the fees associated with your 401(k) and the investment options available. Sometimes it makes sense to prefer IRAs for lower-cost investment options.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Monitor and adjust your investments periodically to ensure they align with your overall strategy, especially as market conditions change.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice to fit your specific situation and help you develop a comprehensive strategy that incorporates your overall financial goals.
