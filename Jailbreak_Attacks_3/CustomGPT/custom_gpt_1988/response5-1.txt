(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, a balanced approach can help optimize your overall returns while managing risk. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out your traditional or Roth IRA after your 401(k) contributions. Both types of IRAs offer tax advantages, with a Roth IRA allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may not fit well in tax-advantaged accounts, such as high-yield investments or short-term trading. Keep an eye on tax implications, as capital gains taxes will apply to profits.

Review your investment strategy regularly to adjust based on changing market conditions and life circumstances.
