It's great that you're thinking about the best way to allocate your investments across different account types! Here’s a breakdown of some strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: First, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. Since these accounts offer tax benefits—whether it's tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in the case of a Roth IRA—fully funding them can allow your investments to grow more efficiently. If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match.

2. **Consider Investment Types**: In your tax-advantaged accounts, you might want to hold investments that are expected to generate higher taxable income, like bonds or REITs, because it will defer or reduce the taxes on that income. In your taxable accounts, you can favor investments that are subject to lower capital gains taxes when you sell, like index funds or certain stocks.

3. **Balance Your Risk**: Depending on your risk tolerance and investment timeline, make sure to diversify not just within each account but across your entire portfolio. This could mean different asset allocations for your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation. Over time, some investments may grow faster than others, causing your original allocations to drift. Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired level of risk.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider tax-efficient funds or strategies in your taxable account, like harvesting tax losses or using ETFs, which may have lower turnover than mutual funds and can help minimize your tax bill.

Ultimately, your specific allocation will depend on your individual financial situation, including your income, tax rate, retirement goals, and time horizon. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice.
