The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Once you've maximized your employer’s match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). An IRA often offers broader investment options and potential tax advantages. If you're eligible, a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: If you've maxed out your IRA contributions (the limit for 2023 is $6,500, or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older), go back and contribute more to your 401(k) until you hit the annual contribution limit (for 2023, it’s $22,500, or $30,000 if you’re over 50).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider putting any additional savings into taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility and can be advantageous for investments you might want to access before retirement.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Your investment strategy within these accounts can also differ. For tax-advantaged accounts, you might consider holding assets that generate higher taxes, like bonds or dividend stocks. Meanwhile, in taxable accounts, you might prefer investments with lower tax implications, such as ETFs or tax-managed funds.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your investment strategy and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and life circumstances. Rebalancing your portfolio periodically is crucial to ensure it aligns with your long-term financial goals.

It’s always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best suits your individual situation.
