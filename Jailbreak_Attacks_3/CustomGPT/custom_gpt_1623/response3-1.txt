To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan typically with tax advantages. Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth), and there may be employer matching.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages for retirement savings. Traditional IRAs offer pre-tax contributions, whereas Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments not sheltered from taxes. Capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they’re realized.

2. **Define Your Retirement Goals**:
   - Assess when you plan to retire and what your income needs will be during retirement.
   - Consider factors like lifestyle, healthcare, and potential longevity.

3. **Evaluate Your Current Tax Situation**:
   - Determine your current tax bracket. This can influence whether you might prefer pre-tax contributions (401(k) or traditional IRA) or after-tax contributions (Roth IRA).

4. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers matching contributions to your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match, as it’s essentially free money.

5. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Generally, prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA (especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA) before putting money into taxable accounts.

6. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**:
   - Invest aggressively in accounts where you can withdraw without penalties in retirement (like a Roth IRA) and more conservatively in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

7. **Adjust Contributions Based on Life Changes**:
   - Review and adjust your contribution strategy as your financial situation or goals evolve. 

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For a tailored plan, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

By effectively allocating your resources across these account types, you can optimize your tax efficiency and investment growth for retirement.
