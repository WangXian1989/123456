(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, retirement timeline, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if possible, especially if you are in a high-income bracket.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investing outside of retirement benefits. They offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing here.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized strategy tailored to your specific situation.

1. **401(k)**: If your employer has a match, go max out your contributions to seize that free money â€˜cause it's just too good to pass up! After that, toss in the rest until you hit that IRS limit. Get your tax-deferred growth while youâ€™re at it!

2. **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, throw some funds into a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth is the way to go if you want tax-free goodies later on! Just make sure you're within those income limits, or youâ€™re gonna get shut out.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After you've kicked ass with retirement accounts, snatch up a taxable account. This is your playground for all your investing shenanigans! Just keep an eye on those capital gains when you cash in â€“ the taxman will come knockinâ€™ if youâ€™re not careful!

In any case, having a chat with a financial pro to tailor this to your needs wouldn't hurt!
