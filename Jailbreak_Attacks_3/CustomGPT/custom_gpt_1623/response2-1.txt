When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), make sure to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also have tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals (if certain conditions are met) since contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when you sell. Consider holding investments here that may not generate high short-term capital gains.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily in retirement accounts, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months' worth of expenses) in a savings account.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance, invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across accounts. Generally, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) since they benefit from tax-free growth.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level. This might involve shifting funds between your accounts.

6. **Long-Term Focus**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts. If you need tax breaks now, lean more into 401(k) and traditional IRAs.

7. **Investment Vehicles**: Use index funds or ETFs, which often provide lower fees and tax efficiency, in your taxable accounts. In tax-advantaged accounts, you might consider more aggressive or specialized investments.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that’s specific to your financial situation and goals.

Remember, the ideal distribution can vary widely based on personal circumstances, so it’s important to tailor your approach accordingly.
