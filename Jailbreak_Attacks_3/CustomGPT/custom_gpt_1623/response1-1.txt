When it comes to distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best approach will depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and investment preferences. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly enhance your long-term growth.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If you can, max out your IRA contributions. Consider whether a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA is more beneficial based on your current and expected future tax rates.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within your accounts, diversify your investments to balance your risk and return. This could include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Think about the tax implications of each account type. For example, long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, so it might make sense to hold certain investments there.

6. **Retirement Timeline**: If you're closer to retirement, you might want to gradually shift to more conservative investments. For those further away, a more aggressive approach could yield higher returns.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with your goals and risk tolerance. 

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of personal finance and tax implications, it can be beneficial to talk to a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Make sure to align these strategies with your specific financial situation and goals.
