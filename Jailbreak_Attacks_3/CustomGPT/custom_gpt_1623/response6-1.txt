Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your retirement goals, tax preferences, and investment strategy. Here are some general tips to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate. It may be beneficial to hold investments that generate ordinary income in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize your tax burden.

3. **Evaluate Your Financial Goals**:
   - Assess whether you need liquidity (cash availability) in the short term. If so, allocate more to taxable accounts.
   - Plan your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon for each account type.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you have a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk and improve potential returns.

Itâ€™s advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
