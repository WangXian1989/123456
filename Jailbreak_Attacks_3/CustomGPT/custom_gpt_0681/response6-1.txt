To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. Max out your contributions if possible, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income level and eligibility, consider contributing to either a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA may offer immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate less taxable income, such as index funds or tax-managed funds. Focus on holding investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Place bonds and higher-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while keeping stocks in taxable accounts to leverage lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 3. **Consider Overall Goals and Risk Tolerance**
   - **Retirement vs. Short-term Needs**: Allocate funds based on when you will need access to the money. Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term goals and taxable accounts for shorter-term needs.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

By balancing contributions and investment strategies across these accounts, you can enhance your overall financial growth while minimizing tax liabilities. Always reevaluate your strategy annually or when your financial situation changes.
