Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contribution to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: Consider opening a Roth IRA if you qualify, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're in a high tax bracket now but expect to be lower in retirement, a traditional IRA may be a better option to defer taxes today.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that you may need to access before retirement or for funds above your retirement savings. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize tax impact.

### Suggested Breakdown:
- **Max out 401(k), especially if there's an employer match.**
- **Contribute to IRA until you can maximize both types (traditional and Roth).**
- **Allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts, focusing on long-term growth.**

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation and investment goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also tailor these strategies to your unique circumstances.
