To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Next, consider funding your IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation) to benefit from tax advantages.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Useful if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, diversify your portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Use tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) in taxable accounts, while holding higher-income-generating assets (e.g., bonds, REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: In retirement, plan how to draw down from these accounts strategically to minimize taxes. For instance, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first or consider delaying withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts until required minimum distributions (RMDs) kick in.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Monitor performance and adjust your contributions as your financial situation changes or as you approach retirement.

By leveraging the tax benefits of each account type while considering your long-term financial goals and tax implications, you can optimize your investment strategy effectively.
