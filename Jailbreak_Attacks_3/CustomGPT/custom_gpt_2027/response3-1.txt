To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) until you meet your employer’s match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also allow pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs use after-tax contributions. With Roth IRAs, withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends and interest as well as capital gains when sold. These accounts offer more flexibility but less tax advantage.

3. **Assess Your Retirement Timeline**: If you’re far from retirement, prioritize contributions to accounts with the most tax-advantaged growth (like Roth IRAs). Closer to retirement, focus on accounts where you’ll benefit from tax-free or deferred withdrawal.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account, aligning with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Review Contribution Limits**: Stay within contribution limits for each account. For 2023, consider the maximum contributions allowed for your 401(k) and IRA.

6. **Regularly Rebalance**: Periodically assess and adjust your asset allocation based on your goals, market performance, and life changes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies based on your individual circumstances, it can be helpful to seek professional advice.

By following these guidelines, you can create an efficient allocation strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
