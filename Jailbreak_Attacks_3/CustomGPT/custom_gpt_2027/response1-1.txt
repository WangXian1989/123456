To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Max out your IRA contributions if possible, especially if it offers tax benefits (Traditional vs. Roth).
   - Focus on contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowed.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth to benefit from tax deferral.
   - Keep more liquid and non-retirement funds in taxable accounts for flexibility.

4. **Balance Risk and Time Horizon**:
   - Invest based on your risk tolerance and how soon you’ll need the funds. Longer-term investments can handle more volatility.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a good mix of asset classes in all accounts to spread risk.

6. **Review Regularly**: Check your asset allocation periodically and adjust based on changes in your life circumstances or financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
