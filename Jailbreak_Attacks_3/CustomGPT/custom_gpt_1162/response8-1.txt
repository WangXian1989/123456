When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After the match, consider prioritizing contributions to your IRA or Roth IRA. Both offer tax advantages—traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Balance Contributions**: If you have maxed out contributions in your tax-advantaged accounts, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to its limit. 

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that might produce higher taxes, like high-yield bonds or actively managed funds, and reserve tax-efficient funds for your tax-advantaged accounts. 

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts to spread risk and take advantage of different tax treatments.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy considering taxes – generally, it’s advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, followed by tax-free accounts, especially if you want to minimize your tax burden.

7. **Adjust According to Age**: As you get closer to retirement, adjust your asset allocation—typically reducing risk and shifting to more conservative investments in your 401(k) and IRA.

It’s wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific financial situation and goals.
