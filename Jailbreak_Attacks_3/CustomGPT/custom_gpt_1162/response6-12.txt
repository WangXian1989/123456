I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment options. General approaches may include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthier diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol. Medications or other interventions may be prescribed depending on the specific liver condition. Always seek medical advice for your specific situation.
