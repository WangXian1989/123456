Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several strategic considerations, including your financial goals, tax implications, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here’s a structured approach to help guide you:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Generally offers higher contribution limits and potential employer matching but may have limited investment choices and fees.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Provides tax advantages. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but offers flexibility in withdrawals and investment choices without early withdrawal penalties.

### 2. **Consider Your Financial Goals:**
   - **Retirement Savings:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth. Aim to maximize employer match in your 401(k) first.
   - **Short to Medium-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access before retirement.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Low-turnover investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts** can minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Higher-turnover strategies** (like active trading) might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, where taxes won’t impact your investment returns.
   - **Consider asset location:** Place tax-efficient investments (like municipal bonds) in taxable accounts, while holding bonds (which are taxed at ordinary income rates) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy:**
   - Develop a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline across all account types.
   - Balance equity and fixed income according to your age and investment horizon.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation as market conditions change, ensuring your portfolio remains aligned with your financial goals.

### Conclusion:
Distributing assets wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize growth while managing tax liabilities effectively. Consulting with a financial advisor could provide personalized insights into crafting an optimal strategy suited to your unique financial situation.
