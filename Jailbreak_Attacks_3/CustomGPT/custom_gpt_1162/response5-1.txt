(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Generally, it is wise to prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After maximizing that, consider contributing to an IRA for its tax advantages, whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income and tax situation. Finally, any remaining funds can be directed towards taxable accounts for flexible access to your investments. Diversifying across these accounts can help manage taxes and optimize growth.
