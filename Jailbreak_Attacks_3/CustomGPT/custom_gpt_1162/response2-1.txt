Deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing any match, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. This can lower your taxable income now, and your investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.

3. **IRA Contributions**: IRAs (Traditional or Roth) can be beneficial for tax diversification. If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contribution after your 401(k), especially a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider investing in a taxable account. This is particularly useful for short-term goals or if you need liquidity before retirement.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**: Place investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds or real estate investment trusts) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA), while placing stocks with potentially lower turnover in taxable accounts to benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Your current and projected future tax brackets play a significant role. If you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts now. If you expect to be in a lower bracket, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Your financial situation and goals can change. Regularly review your asset allocation and contribution strategy to ensure it aligns with your long-term objectives.

It's often helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique circumstances.
