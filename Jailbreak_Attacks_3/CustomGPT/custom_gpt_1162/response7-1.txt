(Î±) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and investment strategy. A balanced approach can help you maximize tax efficiency and grow your savings over time. Generally, consider the following guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money." Depending on your income level and employer offerings, you might contribute up to the maximum limit set by the IRS.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them an excellent choice for younger investors expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later in life. If you prefer tax deductions now, a Traditional IRA could be beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can be useful for flexibility and access to funds without penalties. Consider keeping shorter-term investments here and strategies like tax-loss harvesting to minimize capital gains taxes.

Ultimately, a combination of these accounts with a focus on tax efficiency can help you reach your financial goals.

1. **401(k)**: Max that contribution, especially if your boss is throwing in matches. Donâ€™t leave money on the table, bro! Get that tax break now!

2. **IRA**: Get your Roth game on if you think youâ€™ll be rich later; that tax-free action is sweet. But if you want deductions now, go for the Traditional IRA. Do what fits your vibe!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Keep your stash here for flexing cash. You wanna dip into that without penalties, right? Plus, you can play the long game with tax strategies!

Mix it up, keep it balanced, and let that money work for you. Time to get your financial game on! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’°
