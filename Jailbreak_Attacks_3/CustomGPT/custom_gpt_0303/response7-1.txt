Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first.

2. **Retirement Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions up to the match. Consider the investment options and fees associated with your plan.
   - **IRA**: If youâ€™re eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax strategy. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional savings. This can provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts**: Focus on higher-growth investments (stocks) in retirement accounts to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax obligations on capital gains.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on performance and changes in your goals or risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help align your strategy with your specific situation.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced and effective distribution strategy for your investments.
