To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s free money. Aim to max out if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you're eligible. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes (e.g., long-term capital gains, qualified dividends).
   - Keep high-turnover investments or bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Maintain a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets. Rebalance as needed to keep your risk in check.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Goals**:
   - For retirement savings, focus on long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - If you have shorter-term goals, prioritize liquidity and conservative investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocations based on performance, life changes, and market conditions.
