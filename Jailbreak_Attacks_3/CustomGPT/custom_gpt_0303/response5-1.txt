The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax considerations, and retirement goals. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Maximize Your 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Lower Current Tax Bracket**: Focus on Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) if you anticipate a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Higher Current Tax Bracket**: Traditional accounts may be more beneficial to defer taxes now.

### 3. **Diversify Withdrawals**
   - Aim for a mix of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts for withdrawals during retirement to optimize your tax situation.

### 4. **Assess Investment Goals**
   - Use your taxable accounts for short-term goals, while keeping long-term investments in retirement accounts.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review and adjust your distribution based on changes in income, expenses, and the market.

Consulting a financial advisor could provide personalized insights tailored to your unique situation.
