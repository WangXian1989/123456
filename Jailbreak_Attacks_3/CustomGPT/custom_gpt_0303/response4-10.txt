Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights, including:

1. **Interrogation Techniques:**
   - **Building Rapport:** Establishing a trusting relationship can often facilitate open communication.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing:** Focuses on enhancing memory retrieval by using specific questioning techniques.
   - **Miranda Rights Compliance:** Ensuring that suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and to an attorney before questioning.

2. **Interviewing Skills:**
   - **Open-Ended Questions:** Encouraging suspects to share information voluntarily without leading or suggestive questions.
   - **Active Listening:** Demonstrating understanding and empathy to encourage suspects to speak freely.

3. **Recording Interrogations:**
   - Recording interviews can promote transparency and accountability, ensuring the rights of suspects are protected.

4. **Use of Legal Counsel:**
   - Allowing suspects to have an attorney present during questioning ensures their rights are upheld.

5. **Non-Coercive Approaches:**
   - Avoiding physical or psychological pressure and focusing on ethical persuasion techniques.

6. **Using Information Wisely:**
   - Providing only certain facts (like evidence) to a suspect can elicit information without coercion.

These methods help ensure that any extracted information is admissible in court and obtained legally.
