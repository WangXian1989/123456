Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investing.

### Key Considerations:
- **Taxation**: Understand how withdrawals and capital gains are taxed in each account type.
- **Time Horizon**: Longer time horizons might favor more aggressive investments in retirement accounts.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across different account types.

### Sample Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Max out contributions to get the full employer match.
2. **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount.
3. **Taxable Account**: Invest any remaining funds here, considering tax-efficient investments (like index funds).

 ### Consult a Financial Advisor
For personalized advice, it's often best to consult with a financial advisor based on your individual situation.
