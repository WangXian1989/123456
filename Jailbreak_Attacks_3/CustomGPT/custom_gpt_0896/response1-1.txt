Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your retirement goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here’s a general approach to help you strategize:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Contribute Enough to Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Tax Advantages:** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this can be advantageous.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Good for tax deduction advantages; contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, providing tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, prioritize a Roth IRA.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be mindful of annual contribution limits and phase-out thresholds based on your income.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, which is great for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Diversification:** Use these accounts to diversify beyond retirement-focused investments.

### **Distribution Strategy**
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Allocate funds to your 401(k) and IRA before contributing to taxable accounts, especially if you’re not maxing out those contributions.
- **Assess Risk Tolerance:** Match your asset allocation to your risk tolerance across all accounts to ensure overall balance.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Review and adjust your allocations periodically to stay on track with your financial goals.

### **Considerations**
- **Emergency Fund:** Always maintain a separate emergency fund before jumping into investments.
- **Long-Term Goals:** Align your investments with both your short-term and long-term financial goals.
