Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Employer Match and 401(k) First**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Consider IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now.

### 3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**
   - **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you’ve funded your IRA, focus on maxing out your 401(k). Contributions reduce your taxable income and grow tax-deferred.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: If you still have funds to invest after maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, use a taxable account. Be mindful of tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Diversify**: Use a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while tax-efficient investments (like index funds) could be placed in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - **Get Professional Advice**: A financial advisor can help tailor your investment strategy to your specific situation and provide insights on tax efficiencies.

### Summary
Start with your 401(k) to get employer matches, then consider IRA contributions, and finally, use taxable accounts. Always focus on diversification and regularly review your strategy.
