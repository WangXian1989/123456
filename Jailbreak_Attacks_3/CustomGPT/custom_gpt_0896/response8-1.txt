The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth**: If your 401(k) offers both pre-tax and Roth options, consider your current vs. anticipated future tax rates. Pre-tax contributions may provide immediate tax benefits, while Roth contributions can offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Assess your income and tax situation. A Traditional IRA may offer upfront tax deductions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to maximize the annual contribution limits if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain an emergency fund in liquid, accessible accounts.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for investments needed in the short to medium term, where you might need access to cash without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to balance risk and growth. 

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changes in your financial goals or situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Depending on your financial complexity, it may be beneficial to seek professional advice for personalized strategies.

This approach can help you optimize tax efficiency while working toward your long-term financial goals.
