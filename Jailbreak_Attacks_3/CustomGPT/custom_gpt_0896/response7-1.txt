To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Determine your financial goals, investment horizon, and risk tolerance.

2. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income now.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax). Offers tax advantages but has contribution limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains, but there are no contribution limits.

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Next, contribute to an IRA. If eligible, a Roth IRA may offer tax-free growth benefits.

4. **Balance Contributions**:
   - Once you're maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, start adding to your taxable accounts for additional investment opportunities.

5. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Investments that produce regular income (like bonds) might be better in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically assess your portfolio allocation based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized guidance can help you tailor a distribution strategy to your specific needs.

This approach helps optimize tax efficiency and aligns your investments with your overall financial strategy.
