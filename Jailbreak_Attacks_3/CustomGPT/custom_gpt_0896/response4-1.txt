To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize maximizing your employer's match, as this is essentially free money. Contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, aiming for the annual limit. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: These allow pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or as a buffer, since capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they are realized.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Consider your risk tolerance and how close you are to retirement. Longer time horizons typically allow for more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investment portfolio is diverse across all accounts to mitigate risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets aligned with your objectives.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw first from taxable accounts, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts to minimize overall tax impact.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially after significant market movements.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure, a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your savings across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
