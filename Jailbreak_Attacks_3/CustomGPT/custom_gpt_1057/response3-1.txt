The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, timeline for retirement, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. If you're in a high tax bracket now or expect to be in a lower one during retirement, this option can be beneficial.
   - **IRA:** Depending on the type, contributions can be tax-deductible (Traditional IRA) or tax-free during withdrawals (Roth IRA). A Roth IRA is often a good choice for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Debt Management:** If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that off before heavily funding retirement accounts, as the interest on debt may outweigh potential investment gains.

4. **Diversification:** Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to mitigate risk and ensure a balanced portfolio.

5. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments you may need to access before retirement. Since they are subject to capital gains tax, consider placing investments that you expect to appreciate in your tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your allocation and rebalance as necessary, considering life changes or market conditions.

Aim to balance your contributions based on these strategies, while keeping in mind your overall financial objectives. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your unique circumstances.
