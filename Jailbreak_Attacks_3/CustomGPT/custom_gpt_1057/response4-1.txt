To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Aim to max out your IRA contributions next, particularly if you have access to a Roth IRA which allows for tax-free growth.

2. **Understand Tax Implications:**
   - 401(k) and traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket.
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them advantageous if you expect your tax rate to increase.

3. **Consider Investment Growth Potential:**
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where they can compound without immediate tax consequences.
   - Keep more conservative investments in taxable accounts, which may provide more favorable tax treatment on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Liquidity Needs:**
   - Reserve some funds in a taxable account for short-term needs, as money in retirement accounts typically incurs penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Rebalance as necessary.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your individual circumstances and goals.
