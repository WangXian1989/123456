Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several key factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this match as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Both accounts offer tax advantages. Contributions to traditional 401(k)s and IRAs may be tax-deductible, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts don’t offer tax advantages, but they provide flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses, preferably in a savings account.

4. **Long-Term Goals:** If you’re saving for retirement, focus more on tax-advantaged accounts. A balanced approach might be:
   - Maximize your 401(k) contributions first due to employer matching.
   - Then, contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).
   - Finally, invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts.

5. **Investment Strategy:** Consider your risk tolerance, age, and retirement timeline when deciding on the allocation within these accounts. Younger investors might lean towards more aggressive investments, while those nearing retirement may prefer more stable options.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and adjust as necessary.

It’s also wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
