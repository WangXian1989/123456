To optimize your money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, max out your contributions.
   - **IRA:** Depending on your income and tax situation, consider contributing to a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

2. **Consider Your Investment Goals:**
   - Assess your financial goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. This will help determine how aggressive or conservative your investment strategy should be.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to reduce risk.

4. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that produce favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains) or tax-efficient funds.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Hold investments that generate a lot of taxable income (like bonds) in your 401(k) or IRA to defer taxes.

5. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Long-term vs. Short-term Needs:**
   - Keep funds for short-term needs (like an emergency fund) in accessible accounts, while focusing on growth in tax-advantaged accounts for retirement.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and financial goals.
