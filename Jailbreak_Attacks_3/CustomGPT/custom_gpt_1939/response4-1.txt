When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the optimal strategy often depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Generally, it's wise to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. This is especially true if your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first. This is a crucial step as it maximizes your retirement savings. After that, consider increasing your contributions to reach the maximum allowed limit for the year if feasible.

3. **IRA Contributions**: After you've maxed out your employer match in your 401(k), prioritize funding your IRA, especially if it offers a broader range of investment options than your 401(k). Depending on your income, you can contribute to a Traditional IRA (pre-tax or tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (post-tax). 

4. **Investment Strategy**: Within these accounts, consider your age, risk tolerance, and time horizon for withdrawals. Generally, younger investors can afford to take more risks, while older investors might prefer a more conservative approach.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your contributions to retirement accounts, you can start directing funds to taxable investment accounts. These accounts can offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices, but you will owe taxes on any gains.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across these accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

Remember, it's beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your financial situation and goals.
