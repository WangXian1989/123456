When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first; it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum limit, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you’re eligible, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA, while funded with after-tax dollars, allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account for more investment flexibility. This can be useful for funding short-term goals without penalties or restrictions on withdrawals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Generally, keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while placing more stable, income-generating investments in taxable accounts, as they often incur higher taxes on dividends or interest.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, plan how you’ll withdraw from each account type strategically to minimize tax implications and sustain your retirement income.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Everyone’s financial situation is different, so consider working with a professional to tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs and goals.

Consistency and periodic review of your investment strategy are key to long-term success.
