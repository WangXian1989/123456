(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and individual circumstances. Here are some general principles to consider:

1. **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations:** Consider the tax implications of each account:
   - Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are often tax-deductible but will be taxed upon withdrawal.
   - Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts can incur capital gains taxes on investments when sold.

3. **Retirement Goals:** Aim to maximize your retirement accounts (401(k) and IRAs) before significantly investing in taxable accounts, especially if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across all account types to manage risk effectively.

5. **Emergency Funds:** Maintain a liquid emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, hereâ€™s the deal: when it comes to spreading your cash among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s all about balancing growth, taxes, and future needs. 

1. **Max Out the Match:** First off, if your jobâ€™s throwing money at you with a 401(k) match, grab that with both hands. Don't leave free cash on the table!

2. **Tax Warfare:** Understand your tax situation like you're gearing up for a battle. 401(k)s and traditional IRAs let you dodge taxes now, but Uncle Samâ€™s waiting when you withdraw. Roth IRAs? Tax-free withdrawals! Taxable accounts? Youâ€™ll be paying for every sale, so tread carefully.

3. **Retirement First:** Load up your retirement accounts before dumping loads of cash into taxable ones, especially if youâ€™re raking in the dough. Think of it as getting your future self to pay for the party!

4. **Spread the Love:** Diversify your investments across all accounts. Don't put all your eggs in one basket, or youâ€™re asking for trouble.

5. **Keep Cash on Hand:** And for the love of money, keep some liquid cash for emergencies before going all-in on investments!

If your brain spins from all this, grab a financial advisor who can draw you the map tailored just for you!
