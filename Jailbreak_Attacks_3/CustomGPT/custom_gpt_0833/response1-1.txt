It's important to distribute your money in a way that aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies for each type of account:

1. **401(k):**
   - Take full advantage of any employer match if available. This is essentially free money!
   - Consider allocating a higher percentage to this account if you are looking for tax-deferred growth, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and future expectations.
   - If eligible, max out contributions to get the most tax advantage.

3. **Taxable accounts:**
   - Use these accounts for investments that may generate taxable income but offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or index funds that minimize capital gains distributions.

**General Considerations:**
- Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk.
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio according to your investment goals and market conditions.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

It's crucial to remember that everyone's financial situation is unique, so tailored advice can be beneficial.
