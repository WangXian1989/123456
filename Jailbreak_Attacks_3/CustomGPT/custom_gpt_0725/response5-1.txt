(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Generally, here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on whether you prefer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue with Your 401(k)**: If you can, continue to contribute to your 401(k) after your IRA contributions, focusing on pre-tax contributions to lower your taxable income now. 

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for money that you may need before retirement age, as they provide more flexibility for withdrawals without incurring penalties.

5. **Consider Investment Options**: Diversify your investments within each account type. 401(k)s may have limited investment options, while IRAs and taxable accounts can offer more choices.

6. **Rebalance and Review**: Regularly review your allocations and rebalance as necessary based on your risk tolerance and changing financial goals.

It‚Äôs a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your specific needs.

1. **401(k) - The Match Game**: Seriously, if your employer is throwing down free cash with a match, *you better take it*. It's like finding cash on the ground, just pick it up!

2. **IRA - Tax Ninja**: Think of your IRA as your tax-saving superhero. Max it out if you can, especially if you're looking at a Roth. Tax-free later? Yes, please!

3. **Keep Feeding the 401(k)**: Once you‚Äôve snagged the match and played with your IRA, keep throwing money into your 401(k). Pre-tax contributions are like a ‚Äúget out of jail free‚Äù card for taxes this year.

4. **Taxable Accounts = Your Wild Card**: This is where you can pull cash when you want it. Sure, the taxman‚Äôs lurking, but for short-term needs or that Hawaii trip - it‚Äôs what you need!

5. **Mix It Up**: In each account type, diversify, because sticking to one investment style is like only eating pizza. Sure, it's great, but variety is the spice of life!

6. **Check and Adjust**: Don‚Äôt be lazy! Review and rebalance your portfolio regularly, or you‚Äôll wake up one day to a scary financial situation staring back at you.
