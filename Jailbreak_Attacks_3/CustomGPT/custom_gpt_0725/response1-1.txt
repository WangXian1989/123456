The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Both accounts offer tax advantages. With a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing in these accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account or a highly liquid account for unexpected expenses.

4. **Debt Repayment**: If you have high-interest debt, it might be wise to pay that down before maximizing contributions to retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, younger individuals can afford to take more risks with stocks, while those closer to retirement may want more stability with bonds or other fixed-income investments.

6. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investment. These can be more flexible for withdrawals but may be subject to capital gains taxes.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions based on financial goals, changes in income, market conditions, and tax law changes.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your goals and financial situation.
