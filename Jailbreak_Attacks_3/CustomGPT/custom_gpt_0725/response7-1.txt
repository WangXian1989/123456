The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA**: If you qualify based on your income, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing your money to grow tax-free and offering tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your employer match, focus on funding your 401(k) or traditional IRA. These accounts reduce your taxable income now and grow tax-deferred until retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These are less restrictive on withdrawals and can be beneficial if you plan to access funds before retirement age.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: You might choose to hold investments with higher tax implications (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes. On the other hand, investments that generate lower tax implications (like growth stocks) can be kept in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Annually**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changes in your goals or circumstances.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
