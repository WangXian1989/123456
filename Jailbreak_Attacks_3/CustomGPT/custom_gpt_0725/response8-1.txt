The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money". Aim to maximize your contribution if you can.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met).

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older) and IRAs ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Adjust your contributions accordingly.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within these accounts, diversify your investments to spread risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.
   - Use index funds or ETFs for broad market exposure at a low cost.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can invest additional funds in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds, which are typically more tax-friendly due to low turnover.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you're saving for retirement, a longer time horizon allows for more aggressive investments in stocks. For short-term goals, consider safer options, like bonds or cash equivalents.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**:
   - Monitor your investments and financial situation regularly. Adjust contributions and asset allocation as needed to stay aligned with your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure, consulting with a financial planner can help tailor your strategy to your specific situation.

Ultimately, the key is to balance growth potential with risk management while maximizing the benefits of tax-advantaged accounts.
