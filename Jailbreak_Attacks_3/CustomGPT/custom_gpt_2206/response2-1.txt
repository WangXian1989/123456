The optimal way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial situation, including your current income, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure you contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA:** 
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, where withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - If you think your tax rate will be lower in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be more advantageous, allowing you to defer taxes until withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need access to before retirement. This can include stocks or mutual funds that have lower turnover and generate less taxable income.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Across Accounts:** 
   - Maintain a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts, considering asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Be mindful of the different tax implications for holding assets in each type of account.

5. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy:** 
   - Investment needs and tax laws can change, so regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure you're still aligned with your financial goals.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that matches your personal financial circumstances.
