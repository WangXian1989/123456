The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (free money!). After that, maximize contributions to your IRA if you're eligible. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional 401(k) or IRA may offer immediate tax benefits. If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth account.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Use all accounts for a diversified investment strategy. You might hold more aggressive investments in your taxable accounts for capital gains, while keeping more stable investments in your retirement accounts.

4. **Understand Withdrawal Rules**: Be mindful of the withdrawal rules and penalties associated with each type of account. This can influence how you want to allocate your funds.

5. **Plan for Flexibility**: If you anticipate needing access to cash before retirement, maintain a portion of your investments in taxable accounts where access is easier without penalties.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Your asset allocation may change over time based on market conditions, so regularly rebalance your investments as needed across all account types to stay aligned with your goals.

Consider speaking to a financial advisor who can help you tailor a strategy based on your individual circumstances.
