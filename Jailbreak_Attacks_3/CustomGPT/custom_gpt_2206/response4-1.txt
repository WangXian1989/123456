Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on contributing to your 401(k) and IRA first as they offer tax benefits. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for each account type. For example, in 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to your 401(k) and $6,500 to your IRAs.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (for traditional) and grow tax-deferred. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Similar to 401(k) for traditional IRAs. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized. Consider holding investments here that are tax-efficient.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

5. **Access to Funds**: Depending on when you may need access to funds, prioritize accounts accordingly (e.g., taxable accounts for short-term needs, while saving tax-advantaged accounts for retirement).

6. **Roth vs. Traditional**: Evaluate your current versus expected future tax rates. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, you might prioritize Roth accounts.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.
