To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money. 

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth IRA) based on your eligibility and tax situation. IRAs generally offer tax advantages that can benefit your long-term savings.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of each account type. Contributions to a Traditional IRA and 401(k) may offer immediate tax benefits, while Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts have different tax treatment on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. This might include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs.

5. **Regularly Review Portfolio**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on performance, changing financial goals, or life events.

6. **Consider Accessibility**: Keep in mind that funds in taxable accounts are more accessible than those in retirement accounts, which may have penalties for early withdrawal. This could influence how much you allocate to each type.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
