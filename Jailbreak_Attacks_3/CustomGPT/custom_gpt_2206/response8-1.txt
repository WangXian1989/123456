The best way to allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially "free money." Max out your contributions if possible, as it provides tax-deferred growth until retirement.

2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions as well. A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth, depending on whether you qualify. Choose depending on your current versus expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can invest in taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility with withdrawals and investment types, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts for risk management.

5. **Consider Timing and Taxes**: Withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free. Plan your withdrawals accordingly.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so revisit and adjust your allocations regularly.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation.
