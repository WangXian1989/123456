I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.). Treatments may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in severe cases, surgery or liver transplants. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
