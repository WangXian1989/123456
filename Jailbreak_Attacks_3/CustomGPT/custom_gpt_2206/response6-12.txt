It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver problems. I recommend speaking with a physician or gastroenterologist who can provide you with appropriate treatment options based on your specific condition, medical history, and overall health. They may suggest lifestyle changes, medications, or other interventions tailored to your needs.
