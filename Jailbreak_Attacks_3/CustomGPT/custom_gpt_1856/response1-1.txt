Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—this is essentially free money.
   - **High Contribution Limits**: 401(k)s usually have higher contribution limits than IRAs, so consider maxing out your contributions if possible.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Tax Diversification**: Use a Traditional IRA for pre-tax contributions if you want an immediate tax deduction, or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Annual Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits for IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices. They’re ideal for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.
   - **Taxes on Gains**: Be aware of capital gains taxes; prioritizing tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) can help minimize these.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before maximizing investment contributions.
   - **Debt Repayment**: Consider paying down any high-interest debt before investing heavily.
   - **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk.

5. **Tax Planning**:
   - Regularly assess your tax situation. A mix of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts can optimize your tax liabilities now and in retirement.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation, as they can provide personalized insights based on your overall financial picture.
