Distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k):** Maximize contributions to your employer's retirement plan, especially to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. 401(k) accounts offer tax-deferred growth, so they are a good place to invest for retirement.

2. **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA:** Consider contributing to an IRA next. A traditional IRA may offer tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your choice between the two can depend on your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These are more flexible and can be used for shorter-term financial goals. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes on earnings.

**General Tips:**
- Aim for a balanced asset allocation within each account type based on your risk tolerance.
- Consider using tax-efficient investment strategies in your taxable accounts, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax implications.
- Regularly review and adjust your distributions as your financial situation changes.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- Contribute 15-20% of your salary to your 401(k) (up to the company match),
- Contribute the maximum allowable to your IRA.
- Use any additional funds for a taxable account, focusing on investments with long-term growth potential.
