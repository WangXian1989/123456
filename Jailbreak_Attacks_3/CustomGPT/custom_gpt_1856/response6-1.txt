Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Often offers employer matching, tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now but tax growth later; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Capital gains taxes apply upon selling assets; however, they provide liquidity and flexibility.

### 2. **Investment Goals:**
   - **Retirement Savings:** Prioritize tax-deferred accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for access to funds without penalties.

### 3. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Maximize contributions to employer-sponsored plans (401(k)) up to the match, then consider IRAs sequentially.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** Aim for at least enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA Funding:** Consider funding a Roth IRA if eligible, for future tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate any excess savings here for liquidity.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 50% (max out to match)
- **IRA:** 30% (consider Roth for tax benefits)
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20% (for flexibility)

### Regular Review:
- Reassess your allocations annually based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

This strategy optimizes tax advantages while ensuring liquidity for short-term needs.
