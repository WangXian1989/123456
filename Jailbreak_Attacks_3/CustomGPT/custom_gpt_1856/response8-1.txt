Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are typically made with pre-tax dollars (traditional 401(k)) or after-tax dollars (Roth 401(k)). Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional or Roth IRA**: Consider if you want tax deductions now (traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth IRA). If eligible, a Roth is often beneficial for younger savers due to tax-free growth.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Each year, aim to maximize your contributions to take full advantage of the tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement. This can include saving for a home, education, or other expenses.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Invest in assets with lower capital gains (like index funds or tax-exempt bonds) to minimize tax liability.

4. **General Allocation Tips**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing.
   - **Diversification**: Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to manage risk.
   - **Age Considerations**: As you approach retirement, consider shifting more assets into safer investments to preserve capital.

5. **Annual Review**:
   - **Reassess Goals**: Regularly review your investment goals, risk tolerance, and allocation to ensure they align with your financial situation.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
