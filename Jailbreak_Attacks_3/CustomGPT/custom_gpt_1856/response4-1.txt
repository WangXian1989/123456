Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts like your IRA and 401(k) before moving too much into taxable accounts. For 2024, the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50), while the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).

3. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Invest in higher-growth or income-generating assets here (e.g., stocks, REITs), as withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Keep more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, tax-exempt bonds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower one during retirement, putting more into tax-deferred accounts may be beneficial. Conversely, if you expect your tax rate to rise, consider contributing more to Roth accounts, if available.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure that your overall portfolio is well-diversified to manage risk effectively.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your portfolio periodically and adjust your distributions among accounts as your financial situation changes or as you approach retirement.

Consulting a financial advisor can help you tailor this general advice to your specific situation.
