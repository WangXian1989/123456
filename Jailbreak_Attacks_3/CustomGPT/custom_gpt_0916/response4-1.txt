To optimize the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) next, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax deductions.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts for Growth**: Use taxable accounts for assets that may benefit from favorable long-term capital gains rates and qualified dividends. Consider holding investments that are more tax-efficient here.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: In taxable accounts, you can offset gains with losses to minimize your tax liability.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Different Assets in Different Accounts**: Consider placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - **Plan for Retirement Withdrawals**: When you retire, consider the order of withdrawals to minimize taxes. Generally, it’s best to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (like 401(k)s), and finally tax-free (like Roth IRAs).

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor strategies to your situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals for optimal asset distribution.

Balancing these elements can help ensure you're maximizing your investment's growth potential while minimizing tax implications.
