Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating more to other accounts. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while a Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - If you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, or if you need more liquidity, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is especially useful for shorter-term goals or for investments that won't be taxed heavily, like long-term capital gains from holding appreciated securities for more than a year.

3. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (e.g., retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For mid to short-term goals, consider using a taxable account for more accessible funds.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on time horizon and risk tolerance. Consider placing higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free, while more stable investments can go into taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and adjust for changes in market conditions or life circumstances.

Each individual's situation is unique, so it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that considers your specific goals and financial situation.
