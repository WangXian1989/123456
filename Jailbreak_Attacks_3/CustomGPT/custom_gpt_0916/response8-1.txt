The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Assess Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income for the year. Aim to max this out if you have employer matching.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, depending on your income and whether you have a retirement plan at work. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not offer tax advantages, but they provide flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for higher-growth investments, since taxes on gains will be deferred.
   - Hold lower-growth or income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

4. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - Once you’ve maxed out any employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) before adding more to your 401(k)—especially if your workplace plan has high fees.

5. **Review Your Asset Allocation:**
   - Make sure your overall investment portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Adjust allocations between accounts accordingly.

6. **Regular Contributions:**
   - Consistently contribute to all accounts according to your financial plan. Consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate market volatility.

7. **Rebalance Annually:**
   - Regularly review your accounts to ensure they align with your investment goals and risk tolerance. Adjust as necessary to maintain your desired allocation.

8. **Tax Planning:**
   - Consult with a tax advisor to strategize on withdrawals and conversions (like from a traditional to a Roth IRA) to minimize your tax liability.

9. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in liquid, accessible savings before fully committing to retirement accounts.

By considering these strategies, you can optimize your money distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to meet your retirement and investment goals effectively.
