To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for higher income earners looking to lower their tax bill.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible (traditional) or tax-free in retirement (Roth). Consider your current versus expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible but less tax-advantaged. Suitable for short-term needs or investments that generate capital gains or dividends.

3. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRAs before taxable accounts to reduce your taxable income.
   - Consider using taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investment choices with your retirement timeline and risk tolerance. For long-term growth, focus on equities; for short-term savings, consider safer options like bonds or cash equivalents.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Monitor your asset allocation regularly to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy. 

6. **Diversification**: Make sure your investments across all accounts are diversified to mitigate risk.

The best approach will depend on your unique financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
