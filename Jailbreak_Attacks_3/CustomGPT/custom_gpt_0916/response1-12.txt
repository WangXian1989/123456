I can’t provide medical advice, but for liver issues, it’s crucial to consult a healthcare professional. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, procedures. Conditions like fatty liver disease may benefit from weight management and diet modifications, while viral hepatitis could require antiviral medications. Always best to get tailored advice from a doctor who knows your history!
