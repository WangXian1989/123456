The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Contribute Enough to Get Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax (or after-tax for Roth 401(k)s), which can reduce your taxable income now.
   - **Investment Choices**: Check the investment options available in your 401(k) plan, as these may influence your decision on how much to allocate.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for IRAs, which could influence how much you invest here each year.
   - **Investment Flexibility**: IRAs often offer a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k) plans.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Money in taxable accounts can be withdrawn at any time without penalties, making these accounts suitable for short-term savings or emergency funds.
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: Be mindful of taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains; strategies like tax-loss harvesting can help mitigate these impacts.
   - **Investment Goals**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income, such as municipal bonds or investments that you plan to hold long-term.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient cash reserves for emergencies before investing.
- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get the employer match. 
- **Maximize IRA Contributions**: If eligible, maximize contributions to both traditional and Roth IRAs based on your tax situation and retirement goals.
- **Taxable Accounts for Additional Investing**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to a taxable account for flexible investing.

### Regular Review and Adjustment:
Make it a habit to review your allocations and adjust them as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances.
