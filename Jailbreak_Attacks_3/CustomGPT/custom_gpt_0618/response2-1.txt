The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After getting the employer match, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k):** This account benefits from tax-deferred growth. Consider maxing it out if you are close to retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and the account grows tax-deferred. If your income is too high for a deductible IRA, consider a Roth IRA instead, which offers tax-free growth.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - In taxable accounts, capital gains taxes apply, so it might be beneficial to hold investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term gains.
   - Avoid holding high-turnover investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts:**
   - Ensure your asset allocation is consistent across all accounts. Maintain a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to manage risk.

5. **Investment Horizon Consideration:**
   - If you have a long time horizon, you can afford to take on more risk (e.g., heavier stock allocation) in retirement accounts.
   - For shorter-term needs, you might want more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance:** 
   - At least annually, review your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and rebalance if necessary.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Seek personalized advice from a financial professional who can provide strategies specific to your financial situation.

Deciding on the right distribution involves careful planning and consideration of your unique circumstances and goals.
