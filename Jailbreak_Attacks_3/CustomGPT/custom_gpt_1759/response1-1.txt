Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA**: If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. Roth IRAs, in particular, offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maxing your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This helps reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Lastly, if you have additional funds after contributing to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can provide more flexibility and access to your money before retirement.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Keep in mind that tax treatment differs across accounts—tax-deferred in 401(k) and IRA, while taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions. 

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
