Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contributions to a 401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth) can grow tax-deferred or tax-free, depending on the type. Prioritize funding these accounts up to the contribution limits.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment to a 401(k).
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax when investments are sold, and dividends are taxed as income.

4. **Assess Your Investment Strategy**: Generally, place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth. Use taxable accounts for investments that produce income, like bonds, which can be taxed at a higher rate.

5. **Diversify Your Investments**: Diversification across accounts can help manage risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.

6. **Revisit Your Distribution Plan Regularly**: Your financial needs, tax laws, and market conditions will change over time, so review and adjust your distributions periodically.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your unique situation, especially regarding tax laws and investment choices.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your long-term financial objectives.
