To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. Focus on maxing out contributions if possible for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate higher taxes in the future, as contributions are made post-tax but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility and to access funds without penalties before retirement. Prioritize investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally invest in a diversified portfolio, such as a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Depending on tax implications, you can hold higher-growth assets here, given the tax advantages for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on income-generating assets, like dividend-paying stocks or municipal bonds, which may have favorable tax treatment.

By distributing your investments thoughtfully among these accounts, you can maximize growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities.
