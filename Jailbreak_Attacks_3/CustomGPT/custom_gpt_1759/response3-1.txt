The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit (for 2023, it's $22,500, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (for 2023, it's $6,500, or $7,500 if you're over 50).

2. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA)** to defer taxes on interest income.
   - **Use taxable accounts for tax-efficient investments** such as index funds or stocks, which typically have lower capital gains distributions.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower one in retirement, prioritize your 401(k) and traditional IRA for tax deductions.
   - If you anticipate being in a similar or higher tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth IRA contributions if you qualify.

4. **Diversify Withdrawals:**
   - As you approach retirement, strategically plan withdrawals from your accounts to manage your tax liabilities and ensure a steady income stream.

5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Regularly assess your investment allocations and contributions to ensure they're aligned with your current financial situation and goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances and objectives.
