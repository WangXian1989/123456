Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize this to take full advantage of the match. It’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA if you are eligible, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

2. **Evaluate Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you may need access to before retirement, or for investments that may generate taxable income (like dividends).

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio within each account. Allocate assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon (e.g., stocks for growth, bonds for stability).
   - Consider holding more tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds and REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor the performance and allocation of your investments across accounts periodically and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Seek Professional Guidance**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your individual circumstances, as they can provide personalized advice.

Balancing contributions among these accounts strategically can help optimize your investment growth and tax efficiency over time.
