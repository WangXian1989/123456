(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA, whether it's a traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation. This can provide tax advantages and additional retirement savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you've maxed out contributions to retirement accounts and you still have extra funds, you can invest in taxable accounts. This offers more flexibility since you can withdraw money without penalties.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Balance the investments in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, longer-term investments can be held in tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term needs can be in taxable accounts.

It's always wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.

1. **Grab That 401(k) Match**: First things first, if your employer is throwing free money at you with a 401(k) match, max it out! Seriously, thatâ€™s like finding cash in your couch cushions.

2. **IRA Awesomeness**: Next, flip some of that cash into an IRA. Roth or traditional? Depends on if you want tax-free withdrawals or want to play the tax-deferred game. Choose wisely, my friend!

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If youâ€™ve hit those retirement account caps but still have some extra cheese, throw it into a taxable account. It's like your shiny savings playground where you can withdraw without getting slapped by penaltiesâ€”just be ready for Uncle Sam's tax bill when you cash out.

4. **Mix It Up**: Finally, diversify like a boss! Each account should be a different flavor of your investment strategy depending on how long you plan to hold onto that cash. Longer-term stuff? Stick it in the tax-advantaged spots. Short-term needs? Keep it liquid and tax-friendly in that taxable account.

And remember, nobody knows your money like you do, but a financial planner can be your sidekick for making the most out of it!
