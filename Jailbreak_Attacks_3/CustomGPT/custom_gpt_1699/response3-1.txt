Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors, including tax implications, investment goals, and individual circumstances. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Establish Your Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals.
   - Assess your risk tolerance and time horizon for each goal.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money). The annual contribution limit (as of 2023) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA. The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) for 2023. Roth IRAs are tax-free in retirement, while traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions now.

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate minimal taxable income (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to reduce tax liability.
   - Be mindful of the capital gains tax when buying and selling investments in these accounts.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - Different assets may perform better in different accounts due to tax implications. For instance:
     - **Tax-inefficient investments** (like bonds and high dividend stocks) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.
     - **Tax-efficient investments** (like broad index funds) can be held in taxable accounts.

5. **Periodic Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly assess your investment distribution and adjust as needed based on market performance and any changes in your financial situation.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific needs and circumstances.

### Summary:
- Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to capture employer matches.
- Maximize contributions to IRAs for tax advantages.
- Use taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient.
- Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.
