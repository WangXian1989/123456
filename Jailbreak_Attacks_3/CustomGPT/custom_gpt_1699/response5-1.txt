Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: Maximize your contributions since 401(k) plans often have higher limits compared to IRAs.

### 2. **IRA**
   - **Tax Advantages**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), you can benefit from tax deductions or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Investment Options**: IRAs generally provide a wider array of investment choices than 401(k) plans.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Unlike retirement accounts, funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Strategy Recommendations:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with the 401(k) up to the match, then prioritize Roth IRA contributions for tax-free growth if eligible. After that, consider maxing out your 401(k) and adding to taxable accounts as desired.
- **Diversify Investments**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that are less tax-efficient (like bonds) and keep long-term growth assets in your tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on gains.
- **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations periodically as your financial situation and goals change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this advice to your specific circumstances.
