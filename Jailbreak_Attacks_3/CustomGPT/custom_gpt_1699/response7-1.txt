Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; itâ€™s free money.
   - **High Contribution Limits**: Maximize contributions to take full advantage of tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth; otherwise, a Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Decide between a traditional or Roth based on your current and anticipated future tax rates.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Use these accounts for short-term goals or for liquidity, as they are subject to capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax impact.

### **Strategies for Distribution**
1. **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts to easily access funds without penalties.
2. **Mid to Long-Term Goals**: Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRAs).
3. **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on risk tolerance across all accounts. Consider a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### **Regular Review**
- **Periodic Assessment**: Review your allocation annually or when there are major life changes (job switch, marriage, etc.).

### **Professional Advice**
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Balancing these accounts effectively will enhance your long-term financial health.
