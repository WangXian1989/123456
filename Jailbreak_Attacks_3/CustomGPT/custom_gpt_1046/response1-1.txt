To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt (like credit cards), pay that off first before heavily investing.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of living expenses) in a liquid account before maxing out retirement accounts.

4. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to max out the employer match and then decide how much more to contribute based on tax considerations. If your tax bracket is high, contributing more here can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are good for younger investors expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later, while Traditional IRAs can be beneficial for current tax reductions.
  
5. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and access to your money without penalties. Use tax-efficient investment strategies, such as focusing on index funds or ETFs.

6. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon in each account. Generally, more aggressive investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts where growth isnâ€™t taxed annually.

Monitor and adjust your allocations as needed based on changes in income, expenses, and investment performance. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
