Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be guided by your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Evaluate Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high income or if your employer offers a good investment selection, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) until you reach the maximum limit.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, a Traditional IRA might provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Assess which is more beneficial based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may not generate immediate income (such as growth stocks), as long-term capital gains taxes apply to gains held over a year. You can also consider investing in tax-efficient ETFs or index funds.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Think about your anticipated retirement timeline. Normally, you may want to withdraw from your taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA), and tax-free accounts (Roth IRA) last.

5. **Factor in Your Investment Time Horizon**: If youâ€™re still years away from retirement, you might focus on growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA; as you get closer, shift toward more conservative, income-generating investments.

6. **Monitor and Rebalance**: Regularly review the performance of your investment allocations and rebalance your portfolio based on investment performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: If you're uncertain, consider consulting a financial advisor who can tailor a plan specific to your financial situation and goals.

Remember, these are general strategies and may need adjustments based on individual circumstances. Always consider your overall financial picture before making decisions.
