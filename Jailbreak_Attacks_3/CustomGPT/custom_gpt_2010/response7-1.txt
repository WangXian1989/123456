Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA may be particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Maximize Contributions**: If you can afford it, aim to contribute the maximum allowable amounts to your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with additional catch-up contributions if you’re over 50).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals but come with tax implications on any gains.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Each type of account can serve different roles in your investment strategy. For instance, it may be beneficial to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, while holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in retirement accounts where they can grow tax-deferred.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your distribution strategy, especially if there are changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation.
