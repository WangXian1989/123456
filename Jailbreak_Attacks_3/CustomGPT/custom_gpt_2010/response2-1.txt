Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts are tax-advantaged, allowing for tax-deferred growth. Contributions may reduce your taxable income and you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal (or potentially tax-free in the case of a Roth IRA).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes. These accounts may be beneficial for shorter-term goals or if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket when you withdraw funds.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term growth (retirement), prioritize contributions to 401(k) and IRAs.
   - If you have shorter-term goals, consider allocating more to taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting based on the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice can optimize your specific situation regarding risk tolerance, retirement age, and income.

By balancing contributions in this way, you can effectively prepare for both retirement and other financial needs.
