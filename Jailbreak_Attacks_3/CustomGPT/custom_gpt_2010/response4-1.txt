Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax considerations, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Aim to max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA before moving to taxable accounts. These accounts can grow tax-deferred or tax-free, allowing for potentially higher total returns.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income now, while withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - Traditional IRAs follow similar tax rules.
   - Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met, which can be advantageous depending on your expected tax rate in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts will incur taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains, so consider this when reallocating funds.

4. **Diversification Strategy**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts, balancing risk and aligning with your investment horizon.

5. **Investment Goals**: Align your investments within each account based on your financial goals (e.g., aggressive growth vs. conservative income) and time until you need those funds.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain, a professional can help tailor a strategy to your specific needs.

Consider your individual circumstances carefully when deciding how to allocate funds among these accounts.
