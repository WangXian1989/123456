To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high contribution limits and your employer offers a match, prioritize this account. It provides tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer immediate tax deductions, consider a Traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to a taxable investment account. This provides flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be used for short- to mid-term financial goals.

4. **Investment Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Regular Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in financial goals or life circumstances.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**: Keep in mind future tax implications. Generally, itâ€™s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
