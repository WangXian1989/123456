Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay capital gains tax on profits; it's important to balance investments to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - **Different Investments**: Use your tax-advantaged accounts for more volatile investments (like stocks) and bonds in taxable accounts for better tax efficiency.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investment in each account based on your risk profile and time horizon.

### 4. **Keep an Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account to avoid withdrawing from your investments prematurely.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to align with your goals and risk tolerance, considering market changes.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can offer personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.

By employing a strategic approach that prioritizes tax efficiency, you'll be better positioned for growth over time.
