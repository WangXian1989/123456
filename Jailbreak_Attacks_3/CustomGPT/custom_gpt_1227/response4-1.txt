To effectively distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Maximize contributions to a Roth IRA if eligible, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings that you may need before retirement, and consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for tax efficiency.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investment choices with your goals. Use tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) for higher-growth investments to maximize their tax benefits.

3. **Risk Management**:
   - Diversify across all accounts. Ensure youâ€™re not overly concentrated in any one investment or account type.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your future withdrawals. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account and adjust your distributions accordingly.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your situation.
