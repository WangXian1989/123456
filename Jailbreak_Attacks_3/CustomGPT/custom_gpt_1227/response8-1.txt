Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is a crucial aspect of financial planning. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have similar benefits to 401(k)s. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth but contributions are post-tax.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Taxed on dividends and capital gains. Better for short-term needs or investments.

3. **Consider Emergency Savings**: Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses).

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to minimize taxes on growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments (bonds), as they may have tax benefits from lower capital gains tax.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes to manage risk effectively.

6. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and plan accordingly.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help tailor a strategy based on your individual goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation.

By balancing contributions effectively, you can maximize both growth and tax efficiency across your retirement and investment accounts.
