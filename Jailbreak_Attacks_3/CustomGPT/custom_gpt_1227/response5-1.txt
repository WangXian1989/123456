Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses before investing.

2. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”it's essentially free money.
   - Max out contributions if you can, especially if your plan offers low-cost investment options.

3. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you're eligible and expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, depending on your taxable income and participation in an employer plan.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest any additional savings here; focus on tax-efficient investments (index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Use this account for short-term goals or if you need flexibility.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Rebalance periodically to maintain your target allocation.

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for growth (like 401(k) and IRAs) to benefit from compounding over time.
   - Be mindful of capital gains tax in your taxable accounts.
