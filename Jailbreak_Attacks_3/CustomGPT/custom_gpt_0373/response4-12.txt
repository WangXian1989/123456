I'm not a doctor, but here are some common liver treatment options you might explore:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and weight management can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may help reduce inflammation or manage symptoms.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Completely avoiding alcohol is crucial for recovery and to prevent further damage.

4. **Hepatitis Treatments**: If the liver problem is due to hepatitis, antiviral medications may be prescribed.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant or minimally invasive surgery might be necessary.

6. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function are important.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
