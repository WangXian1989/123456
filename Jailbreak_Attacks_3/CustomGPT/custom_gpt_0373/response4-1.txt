Balancing your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some tips to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Take full advantage of any employer match.
   - Focus on higher-growth investments since the funds are tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Use a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - A Traditional IRA can be beneficial if you want to reduce taxable income now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in assets with lower tax implications, like index funds or ETFs.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments in these accounts, as dividends and capital gains are taxed annually.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).
   - Adjust the risk profile based on your age and retirement timeline.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust allocations to maintain intended risk levels.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
