Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Contributing to a Traditional IRA can reduce your taxable income, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains and dividends are taxable, but they offer flexibility since you can withdraw anytime without penalties.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds) in each account type for better risk management.

4. **Time Horizon**: If you’re investing for short-term goals, a taxable account may offer more liquidity. Long-term goals can benefit from tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account to maximize benefits.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement, considering tax implications.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
