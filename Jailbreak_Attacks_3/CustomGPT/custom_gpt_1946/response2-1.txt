To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **IRAs for Tax Advantages**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) for additional tax benefits depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need to access before retirement. This provides more liquidity and flexibility without penalties.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds and certain funds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts to reduce risk.

6. **Review Periodically**: Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
