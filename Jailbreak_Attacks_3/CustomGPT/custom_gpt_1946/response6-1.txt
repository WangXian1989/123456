Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic considerations to optimize tax benefits and long-term growth. Here are some steps you might consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) aligns better with your tax situation and retirement goals.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Allocate money here only after maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. This offers greater flexibility without tax penalties for early withdrawal.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might incur high capital gains taxes elsewhere, such as stocks held long-term.

3. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Ensure you're diversifying your investments across these accounts. A mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset types can help balance risk and growth.
   - Reassess your asset allocation regularly to align with your risk tolerance and market conditions.

4. **Consider Fees and Expenses**:
   - Evaluate the fees associated with each account type and select even low-fee options to maximize your returns over time.

5. **Annual Review**:
   - Set a calendar reminder to reevaluate your investment strategy each year, adjusting contributions based on changes in income, tax situations, or financial goals.

By considering these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for both growth and tax efficiency.
