It's important to consider a few factors when deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some strategies to optimize your investments:

1. **401(k)**: Max out your employer match first. Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on that money until you withdraw it. This is often a great first step.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Consider contributing to this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. Contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you believe you'll be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing here instead, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these funds for shorter-term goals or needs. It's also a good place for holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

**General Tips**:
- Maintain a diversified portfolio within each account.
- Consider your time horizon and risk tolerance.
- Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.
