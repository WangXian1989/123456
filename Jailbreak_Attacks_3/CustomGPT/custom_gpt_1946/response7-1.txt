Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and overall investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money".

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After getting your employer match, contribute to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages. Decide which type of IRA suits you best:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your IRA, continue investing in your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Consider using taxable accounts for investments that generate dividends or interest, since these are taxed yearly. They’re also great for funds you might need in the short-term as they offer more liquidity.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, invest across a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, index funds) to manage risk according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your personal circumstances.

### Key Considerations:
- **Time Horizon**: Longer time frames may allow for more aggressive investing in stocks.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Align your asset allocation with how much risk you're comfortable taking.
- **Tax Implications**: Understand the tax consequences of withdrawing from each account type.

When facing significant life changes (like becoming a parent or nearing retirement), reevaluate your distribution strategy.
