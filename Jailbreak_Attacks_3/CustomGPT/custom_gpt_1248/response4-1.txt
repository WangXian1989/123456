Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are often pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or after-tax (Roth 401(k)), providing tax benefits depending on your situation.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: Take advantage of higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed on withdrawal) and a Roth IRA (taxed on contributions, tax-free withdrawals in retirement) based on your tax situation now and in retirement.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits to IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investment choices.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be aware of capital gains taxes when selling investments. Holding investments long-term can help minimize these taxes.
   - **Investment Variety**: You can hold a wider variety of investments compared to retirement accounts.

### Strategy Tips:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses.
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify within each account type according to your goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient ones (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.
