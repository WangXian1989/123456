Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **401(k) Plans:**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax Contributions:** Consider contributing pre-tax to lower your taxable income now.
   - **Investment Options:** Choose investments with potential growth that align with your risk tolerance.

### 2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:**
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible. Withdrawals during retirement are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Ensure you are adhering to annual contribution limits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes, such as index funds or ETFs.
   - **Diversification:** Use taxable accounts for investments that may not generate high taxable events or for short-term goals.

### General Tips:
- **Diversify Investments:** Across all accounts, maintain a diversified portfolio that reflects your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Review and Rebalance:** Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary.
- **Consult with a Financial Advisor:** Tailor your distribution strategy to your unique financial situation and goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize employer matching.
2. Allocate funds to a Roth IRA if you're eligible based on income.
3. Invest any additional savings into taxable accounts for flexibility.

This blended approach can cover various tax implications, growth potential, and accessibility, aligning with your long-term financial objectives.
