Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on maxing out these tax-advantaged accounts. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (plus additional catch-up contributions if you're over 50).
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Consider whether a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA aligns better with your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, start investing in taxable accounts. Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk profile.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A personalized approach based on your specific financial situation can ensure you make the most informed decisions.

Adjust your strategy as your financial situation changes or as you approach retirement age.
