The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. Understand Account Types:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax-deferred growth; can be traditional (tax-deductible) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Offer flexibility but are subject to capital gains tax on profits and dividends.

### 2. Contribution Priorities:
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA (traditional or Roth) for additional tax benefits.
   - **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: After your IRA, return to your 401(k) and maximize contributions up to the annual limit.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings once your tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out.

### 3. Consider Investment Strategy:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Your investment choices should reflect your risk tolerance, time horizon, and retirement goals.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Balance your investments between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your age and risk profile. Generally, aim for higher risk (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts due to potential tax implications on gains.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place investments with high growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. Review and Adjust:
   - **Revisit Your Plan Regularly**: Monitor your investments and adjust your contributions as your financial situation or goals change.
   - **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized guidance, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

### Conclusion:
A suggested allocation might be starting with the 401(k) for the employer match, then maxing the IRA, followed by additional contributions to the 401(k) and any taxable accounts. This approach ensures you are optimizing tax advantages while planning for future needs.
