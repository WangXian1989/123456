Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your contributions here first, especially if you have a high tax rate. Contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, either a Traditional or Roth IRA can be beneficial. Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more advantageous.
   - If you're currently in a lower tax bracket, prioritizing pre-tax accounts like a Traditional IRA can be beneficial.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. They allow you to access funds without penalties and can be advantageous for long-term capital gains.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, ensure you're diversifying your investment types (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - Monitor and adjust your contributions and investments based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking to a financial planner to create a personalized strategy that factors in your unique situation.

By following these steps, you can effectively optimize your contributions across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
