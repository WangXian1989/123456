The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on funding your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. These accounts can provide tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in the case of a Roth IRA.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, contributing to a traditional 401(k) or traditional IRA may be more beneficial as it can lower your taxable income. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses. This typically means having 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in a liquid account.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Within each account, ensure you are diversifying your investments and maintaining an appropriate asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks, bonds, and other asset classes should be balanced according to your overall investment strategy.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to each account to ensure consistent saving and investing. This helps you take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your accounts and investment performance. Adjust your contributions and investment choices as necessary to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about your strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice. They can help you create a tailored plan based on your specific circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can create a distribution strategy that works best for your individual financial situation.
