The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider for each account type:

1. **401(k) Plan:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the contribution limits set by the IRS for 401(k) plans. For 2023, the limit is $22,500, or $30,000 if you are age 50 or older.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Consider your current tax bracket and expected tax situation in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the IRA contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you are age 50 or older. 

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Investment Flexibility:** Taxable accounts provide flexibility with no contribution limits and easier access to funds. Consider using this account for investments that generate capital gains over those in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on income and capital gains.
   
### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Short-Term Goals (1-5 years):** Consider allocating more to a taxable account for liquidity.
- **Medium-Term Goals (5-10 years):** Prioritize maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, while maintaining a portion in taxable accounts.
- **Long-Term Goals (10+ years):** Aim to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, since they offer tax benefits that are especially useful over longer periods.

### Overall Considerations:
- **Diversification:** Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account.
- **Regular Review:** Regularly review your investment allocations and contributions as your financial situation or tax laws change.
