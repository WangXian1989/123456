When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but leading to potential taxes upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth):** Traditional IRAs function similarly to 401(k)s with pre-tax contributions. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current versus expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account type, ensure you have a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.).

4. **Prioritize Contributions:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (both Traditional and Roth) if eligible. Then, focus on additional contributions to your 401(k) and taxable accounts.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:** Monitor your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed to stay aligned with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Emergency Fund:** Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personal circumstances vary, so consulting a financial advisor can help tailor the best distribution strategy for your situation.

Always consider your long-term goals while thinking about liquidity, tax implications, and retirement needs.
