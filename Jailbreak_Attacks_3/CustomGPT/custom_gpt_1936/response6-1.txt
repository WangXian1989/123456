To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings (interest, dividends, capital gains) are taxed in the year they occur.

2. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, if eligible, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Assess Individual Goals:**
   - **Short-term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need in the near future.
   - **Long-term Goals**: Focus more on maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions for retirement.

4. **Consider Investment Options:**
   - **401(k)**: Typically limited to the plan’s selections; choose low-cost index funds if available.
   - **IRA**: Broader investment choices; consider a diverse mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use ETFs and tax-efficient funds to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance:**
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts, adjusting as needed.

6. **Monitor and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance to maintain your desired level of risk.

By carefully considering these factors, you can optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
