To provide you with tailored advice on distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I'll need to understand a bit more about your financial situation. Could you please share your age, risk tolerance (conservative, moderate, aggressive), and any specific financial goals you have (retirement, purchasing a home, etc.)? This information will help me give you personalized guidance.
