The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing your employer's match in your 401(k), as this is free money. Then, consider fully funding your IRA, especially if it offers tax benefits.

2. **Tax Efficiency**: Utilize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments that would generate significant taxable income or capital gains. Keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable account.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that across all accounts, you're maintaining a diversified portfolio to spread risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for retirement withdrawals by considering tax implications. For instance, you may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a distribution strategy that fits your personal financial situation.
