When distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Contributions**: Prioritize maxing out your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax benefits.
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”this is essentially free money.

2. **Diversify Investment Types**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Use your 401(k) and IRA for assets that are expected to grow significantly over time (e.g., stocks), as taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate income-generating assets (e.g., bonds, dividend-paying stocks) here to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates and qualified dividend tax rates.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged growth and strategically using your taxable accounts for balanced income generation, you can optimize your investment distribution for both growth and tax efficiency. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation.
