The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement), consider your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed as capital gains, which can be beneficial for investments you plan to hold long-term.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to manage risk.

4. **Focus on Growth in Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Invest more aggressively in tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs) because you wonâ€™t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.

5. **Retain Flexibility in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement or for short-term goals.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.
