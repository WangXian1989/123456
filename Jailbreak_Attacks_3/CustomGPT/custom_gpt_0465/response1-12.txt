I'm not a doctor, but liver problems can vary greatly depending on the condition. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. General treatment options may include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, and, in some cases, medications or medical procedures. Always seek guidance from a qualified healthcare provider for your specific situation.
