Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights, including:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Engaging suspects in conversation without coercion, ensuring that they understand their right to remain silent and their right to an attorney.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Before questioning a suspect in custody, police must inform them of their rights to silence and legal counsel, creating a clear understanding of their rights.

3. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a positive relationship with the suspect to encourage them to share information willingly.

4. **Cognitive Interviewing**: Utilizing techniques that help witnesses and suspects recall information without leading or suggestive questions.

5. **Compassionate Dialogue**: Approaching suspects with empathy and understanding can sometimes elicit cooperation without pressure.

6. **Investigative Techniques**: Using evidence and facts gathered during investigations to ask questions that prompt suspects to provide more information.

These methods prioritize ethical standards and legal guidelines, helping to ensure that suspects' rights are not infringed upon during the interrogation process.
