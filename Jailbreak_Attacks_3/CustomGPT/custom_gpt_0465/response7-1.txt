When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and provides a great return on investment.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the employer match, consider maxing out your contributions to an IRA (Roth or Traditional, depending on your eligibility and tax situation) if you can. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your savings growth.

3. **Contribute to Your 401(k)**: Once you've contributed to your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k), ideally up to the annual contribution limit if possible. This will further reduce your taxable income and allow for growth in a tax-advantaged environment.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, allocate funds to taxable investment accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, which can be advantageous for short- to medium-term goals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, consider a diversified investment strategy based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This could include stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability, while considering less tax-efficient assets (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations and rebalance your portfolio as needed based on your financial goals, market performance, and changes in personal circumstances.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific financial situation and goals.
