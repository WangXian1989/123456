When considering distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account your overall financial goals, tax implications, and investment preferences. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is free money. If you can, maximize your contributions to the annual limit.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, contribute to either a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: 
   - If you are currently in a lower tax bracket, contributing to a Roth IRA might be beneficial. Conversely, if you're in a higher bracket, a Traditional IRA may present immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings after you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts. Investments in taxable accounts can be more flexible in terms of withdrawals, but you’ll need to consider capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, ensure you have a diversified mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to stay aligned with your investment goals and market conditions.

Ultimately, it’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy suited to your unique situation.
