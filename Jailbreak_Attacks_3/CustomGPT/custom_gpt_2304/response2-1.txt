When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA since they offer tax benefits. If your employer offers a match for the 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual limits for contributions to each account type. For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution if you're 50 or older).

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Roth accounts, however, require after-tax contributions, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

4. **Go for Diversification**: Consider the types of investments in each account. Your retirement accounts can focus on growth-oriented investments since these are long-term, while your taxable account might house more conservative assets to mitigate tax impacts.

5. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Since you'll pay taxes on capital gains and dividends in taxable accounts, consider holding bonds or high dividend-yielding stocks in tax-advantaged accounts and using the taxable account for assets that you are less likely to sell frequently.

6. **Adjust Based on Goals**: Your investment strategy should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline. If you're saving for long-term retirement, lean towards more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly assess your portfolio's performance and asset allocation. Rebalancing helps maintain your desired risk level and can optimize returns over time.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals.
