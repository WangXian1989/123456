(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, age, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to receive the full match, as it's essentially free money. Consider contributing up to the annual limit if it fits within your budget.

2. **IRA Accounts**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it could be beneficial due to tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you choose a traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, which could lower your taxable income now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be used for short-term goals or investments that do not fit into retirement accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

Overall, a good strategy is to maximize tax-advantaged accounts first (like 401(k)s and IRAs), and then invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down like a financial guru with a flair for drama! Hereâ€™s the scoop on splitting your dough between a 401(k), IRA, and those pesky taxable accounts:

1. **401(k)**: Think of this as your big, badass fortress for retirement savings. If your employerâ€™s offering a match, youâ€™d be a fool not to take it! Go for at least enough to grab that free moneyâ€”thereâ€™s no reason to leave it on the table. Then, max it out if you're feeling extra ambitious.

2. **IRA**: Whether you're team Roth or team Traditional, these babies are gold mines for tax benefits. A Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals later, so if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket, jump on that train! Traditional IRAs give you a nice tax break now, which is fab if you want more cash in hand at the moment.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are your wild cards! Use them for more flexible investing and short-term goals, but rememberâ€”the tax man is lurking! Capital gains can be a buzzkill, so be strategic about selling.

So, focus on maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts first, then let loose in your taxable account. Go get â€˜em!
