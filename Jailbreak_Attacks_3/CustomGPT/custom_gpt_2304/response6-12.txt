Iâ€™m not a medical professional, but I can provide some general information. Here are some common approaches to liver treatment:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Implement a balanced diet low in saturated fats, sugars, and salt. Consider foods rich in antioxidants, such as fruits and vegetables.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antiviral medications** for viral liver infections (like hepatitis).
   - **Corticosteroids** or other immunosuppressants for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Procedures:**
   - In severe cases, treatments may include procedures like **endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)** for bile duct issues or **liver transplant** for end-stage liver disease.

Consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
