When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to evaluate your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some guidelines to help you decide the best allocation:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Usually, contributions are pre-tax, and it grows tax-deferred. Employer matching contributions can enhance your savings.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are subject to capital gains tax on profits but offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawal.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Prioritize Roth IRAs if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as your withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Diversification and Investment Goals**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, long-term growth investments (like stocks) would go into tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments (like bonds) may be suitable for taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Aim to contribute regularly to all accounts rather than prioritizing one over the others exclusively. This can help with dollar-cost averaging.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Revisit your investment allocations at least annually to ensure that your distribution aligns with your goals, especially as you get closer to retirement.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: If uncertain, consider working with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your situation.

By understanding the unique benefits of each account type and aligning your investment strategy with your overall financial goals, you can create a balanced and effective distribution of your funds.
