Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as it is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed annually. Suitable for shorter-term goals or if you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Establish an Emergency Fund**: Before allocating investments, ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Diversification is crucial to managing risk. Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) both within and across your accounts.

5. **Choose Based on Time Horizon**:
   - For short-term goals (0-5 years), consider keeping funds in a taxable account or less volatile investments.
   - For medium to long-term goals, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to grow your investments tax-free or tax-deferred.

6. **Investment Strategy**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Stocks may be suitable for higher risk tolerance, while bonds may suit conservative investors or lower-risk profiles.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your investment goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

By considering these factors, you can create an effective strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
