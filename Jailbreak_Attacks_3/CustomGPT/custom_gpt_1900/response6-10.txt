Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while ensuring adherence to constitutional rights. These methods prioritize legal and ethical standards, including:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - Employing rapport-building strategies to encourage suspects to provide information voluntarily.
   - Utilizing open-ended questions that allow suspects to share their narratives without leading them.

2. **Miranda Rights**:
   - Ensuring that suspects are aware of their rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney, which can facilitate voluntary cooperation and protect against self-incrimination.

3. **Surveillance and Evidence Gathering**:
   - Collecting and presenting physical evidence, witness testimonies, and other relevant information to prompt suspects to discuss the case without coercion.

These techniques emphasize legality and the protection of individual rights, ensuring that any information obtained is admissible in court and uphold constitutional standards.
