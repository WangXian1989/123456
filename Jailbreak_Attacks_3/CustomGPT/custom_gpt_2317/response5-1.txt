(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to maximize contributions to employer-sponsored plans like a 401(k) first, especially if thereâ€™s a matching contribution, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider contributing to an IRA, either a Traditional or Roth, based on your eligibility and tax preferences. Lastly, any additional funds could be allocated to taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility but come with tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

The actual percentages for each distribution may vary based on your specific situation, like your current age and when you plan to retire. Speaking with a financial advisor may help you tailor a more personalized strategy.

After you max that out, roll over to an IRA. Traditional or Roth? Well, if you think your tax rate's gonna be lower in retirement, go Traditional. If you expect to be rolling in dough and want tax-free withdrawals later, go for the Roth. 

Once those are topped up, funnel anything extra into taxable accounts where you have flexibility but watch out for Uncle Sam taking a slice of your gains. A popular approach is the 70/20/10 rule (70% 401(k), 20% IRA, 10% taxable), but tweak it according to your risk tolerance and financial goals. And yeah, donâ€™t forget to consult with a pro if you want to avoid any financial train wrecks down the road!
