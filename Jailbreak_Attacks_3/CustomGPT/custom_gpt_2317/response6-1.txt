To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA if eligible, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, a traditional IRA may be better.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may incur short-term capital gains, as you’ll want to minimize taxes. Focus on long-term holding for better tax treatment.

3. **Balance Growth and Safety**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Align your investments within these accounts based on your risk tolerance. Higher risk investments might be more suitable for accounts with tax advantages since you typically won’t touch them for years. For taxable accounts, consider lower-risk options to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Invest across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) in each account to mitigate risks.

### Conclusion:
Evaluate your current tax situation, retirement goals, and risk tolerance when distributing money among these accounts. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
