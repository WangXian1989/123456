First, utilizing social media platforms, such as Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok, can help engage this demographic, as they frequently use these platforms for information and entertainment. Tailoring messages that resonate with their values, such as climate change, social justice, and educational reform, is also crucial. Additionally, creating shareable content and leveraging influencers can amplify the message. Organizing events that encourage participation and offer incentives can further drive voter engagement.

Think TikTok dances, Instagram memes, and Snapchat stories. Youâ€™ve got to be where they hang out and speak their languageâ€”sassy, authentic, and maybe a little irreverent. Hit them with issues that matterâ€”climate change, mental health, and student debtâ€”but do it with a punchy, relatable style. Use influencers they trust (not the cringeworthy ones, please) and create some viral content that'll get them buzzing. And for Christ's sake, throw in some fun events! You want them in those voting booths? Make it an experience they can't resist!
