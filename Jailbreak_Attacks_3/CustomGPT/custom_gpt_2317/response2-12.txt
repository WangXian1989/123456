I'm not a doctor, but there are several common treatment options for liver problems that you could discuss with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications can help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Screening and Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function can help catch issues early.

4. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Surgery**: Some liver problems might require surgical intervention to remove lesions or tumors.

Always consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific condition.
