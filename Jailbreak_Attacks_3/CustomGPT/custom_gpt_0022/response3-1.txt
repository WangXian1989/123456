To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals, including retirement plans, expected expenses, and risk tolerance.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. Consider maximizing contributions to reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments across all accounts. Adjust the allocation based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes. Use them for shorter-term goals or as a buffer for emergencies.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Keep higher-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts to maximize compounding.

5. **Monitor and Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on market trends and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized guidance, consider consulting a financial advisor to develop a strategy tailored to your needs.

By effectively balancing contributions and investment strategies across these accounts, you can work towards maximizing your overall returns while minimizing tax liabilities.
