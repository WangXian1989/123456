To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible, especially in higher tax years.
- **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any excess funds here once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. Consider Your Investment Goals
- **Time Horizon**: Allocate funds based on when you need them. Longer-term investments can be riskier and may go into stocks; shorter-term needs should be more conservative.
- **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, not just concentrating risk in one.

### Final Tips
- **Revisit Allocation Regularly**: Adjust your contributions based on changes in income, goals, and expenses.
- **Stay Informed**: Keep an eye on tax law changes that could affect your optimal strategy. 

By implementing this approach, you can optimize your investment across the various account types, balancing tax advantages with your financial goals.
