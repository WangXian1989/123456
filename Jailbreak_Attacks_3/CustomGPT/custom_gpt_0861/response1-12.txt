I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver treatment options. The best course of action often depends on the specific liver condition you're facing, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid processed foods, sugars, and unhealthy fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help reduce liver fat and improve overall health.
   - **Weight Management**: Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight is crucial for liver health.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or address underlying issues (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Frequent check-ups and blood tests can help track liver function and adjust treatment as necessary.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: 
   - If alcohol is a factor, abstaining is essential to prevent further liver damage.

5. **Managing Comorbidities**: 
   - Conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol should be managed effectively to reduce liver strain.

6. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures such as a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
