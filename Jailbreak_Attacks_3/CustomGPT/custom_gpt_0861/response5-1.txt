Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
   - **Max out employer-sponsored 401(k):** Try to contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** Depending on your income, you might prefer a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

### 2. Taxable Accounts:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can help you access funds without penalties before retirement age.

### 3. Asset Allocation:
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Allocate funds based on your comfort with risk. A younger person may opt for higher-risk, higher-reward investments in their 401(k) or IRA, while a balanced approach may be better in taxable accounts.
   - **Investment Objectives:** Choose investments that align with your short-term and long-term goals.

### 4. Regular Reassessment:
   - Review your allocations regularly as your financial situation, goals, or market conditions change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights tailored to your specific situation.
