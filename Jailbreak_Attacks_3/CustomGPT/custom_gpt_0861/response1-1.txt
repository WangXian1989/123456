Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions (if possible), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages.

### 2. Assess Emergency Savings:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a low-risk, easily accessible account, usually a savings or money market account.

### 3. Taxable Accounts:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts. These are flexible and can be used for goals beyond retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. Asset Allocation:
   - **Equities vs. Bonds:** Younger investors might lean more towards stocks for growth in retirement accounts, while older investors might prefer bonds for stability.
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust the mix according to your comfort level with risk. 

### 5. Diversification:
   - Diversify within accounts to spread risk across different asset classes and sectors.

### 6. Regular Rebalancing:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure you stay aligned with your goals.

### 7. Consider Professional Advice:
   - If you’re unsure, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

#### Key Considerations:
- Tax implications, investment goals, and time horizon are essential in determining your distribution strategy.
