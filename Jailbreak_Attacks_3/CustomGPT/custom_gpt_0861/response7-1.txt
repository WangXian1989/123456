Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money. If you're under 50, the limit is $22,500 in 2024, plus a $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're over 50. 
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. The contribution limit is $6,500 for 2024, with a $1,000 catch-up for those 50 and older.

2. **Debt Considerations**:
   - If you have high-interest debt, it may be wise to pay that off before maximizing retirement contributions, especially if the interest rate exceeds potential investment returns.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. Think about tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs that minimize capital gains distributions.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Decide on an appropriate asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Consider having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all account types.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when you'll withdraw funds. Generally, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to minimize tax liability over time.

6. **Reevaluate Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations annually or after significant financial changes (like a job change, market shifts, etc.) to ensure they align with your ongoing financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies specifically to your situation.
