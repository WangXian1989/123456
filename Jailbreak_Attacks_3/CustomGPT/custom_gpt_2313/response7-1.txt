Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income; tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement (if conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Taxed on dividends and capital gains, but provide flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debts**:
   - If you have high-interest debts, consider paying those down before maximizing contributions.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it’s beneficial to draw down taxable accounts first to let tax-deferred accounts continue growing.

6. **Tax Planning**:
   - Be mindful of your current and expected future tax brackets. A strategic approach can help minimize taxes.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically reassess your contributions and investment strategy based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
