To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

### 1. **Understand Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Tax-deferred growth; employer matches can enhance contributions.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages but offer flexibility; capital gains and dividends are taxable.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Goals:**
   - Determine your retirement goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance.
   - Consider immediate liquidity needs versus long-term growth.

### 3. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match—it’s essentially free money.

### 4. **Contribute to IRAs:**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. Max out contributions if possible to leverage tax benefits.

### 5. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts for short- to medium-term goals, such as buying a home or funding children’s education.

### 6. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk. Balance stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your investment strategy.

### 7. **Review Regularly:**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or investment goals.

By systematically applying these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for growth and tax efficiency.
