To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Good for pre-tax contributions and potential tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if eligible, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Balance Contributions**:
   - Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
   - Max out your IRA contributions (if possible) for tax advantages.
   - Any remaining funds can go into your 401(k) or taxable accounts based on your overall financial goals.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower tax implications, like municipal bonds or long-term investments, to minimize capital gains.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Adjust your portfolio based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. This includes stocks, bonds, and other assets to spread risk.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review your accounts regularly to ensure your investment strategy aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Think about your expected tax situation in retirement. Traditional accounts may lead to higher taxable income in retirement, while Roth accounts will allow for tax-free withdrawals.

8. **Consult a Professional**: Consider talking to a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and effective strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
