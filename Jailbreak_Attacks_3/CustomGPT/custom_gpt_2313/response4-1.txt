Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a Traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. This allows your investments to grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed at your ordinary income rate in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type, contributions may be tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-free (Roth) or tax-deferred (Traditional).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax and dividend taxes, but you have flexibility in withdrawals.

4. **Evaluate Your Investment Strategy**: Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, it's wise to hold more aggressive investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow, periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure alignment with your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary widely, so getting tailored advice can help you make informed decisions.

Make sure to consider your specific situation and goals, as these suggestions can vary based on individual circumstances.
