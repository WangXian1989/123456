The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, financial goals, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your income level and tax bracket.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing in accounts you cannot easily access.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may yield less favorable tax treatment (e.g., short-term capital gains) or for funds you may need before retirement age.

4. **Diversification**: Keep a balanced approach by diversifying your investments across these accounts to mitigate risks.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for withdrawals based on your retirement timeline to minimize taxes. Generally, it may be wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first to leave tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Consult a Professional**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

Reviewing the tax implications and your long-term goals will ensure your strategy best suits your needs.
