Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing taxable income for the year.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, lowering taxable income.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Allocate investments based on risk tolerance. Consider more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) and IRAs) where potential growth isn’t taxed immediately.
   - Use more stable, income-generating investments in taxable accounts to manage capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Avoid Frequent Trading:** This can trigger short-term capital gains, which are taxed as ordinary income.

### 5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in savings accounts or money market accounts before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**
   - Monitor your allocations and rebalance as needed based on changing financial goals or market conditions.

### Conclusion
Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation. Balancing these accounts effectively can lead to optimized growth and tax efficiency over time.
