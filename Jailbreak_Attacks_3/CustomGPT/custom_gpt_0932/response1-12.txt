Iâ€™m not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options that are often recommended for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid high-fat, sugary foods and alcohol.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), doctors might prescribe antiviral medications or other drugs.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function are crucial.

4. **Avoid Toxins**: Steer clear of alcohol and other substances that can harm the liver.

5. **Supplements**: Some people benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but consult your doctor before taking any.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis or tumors, surgical options might be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.
