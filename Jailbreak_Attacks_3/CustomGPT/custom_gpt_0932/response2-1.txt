Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions if you can, as 401(k) contributions are tax-deferred.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.
   - A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts.
   - Taxable accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals and can be useful for short-term savings goals.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments to balance risk and return. Typically, equities can be more aggressive, while bonds tend to be more conservative. 
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) and place stocks with capital growth potential in taxable accounts.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations annually or as your financial situation changes.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - If you're uncertain, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs.

Balancing these accounts effectively can help optimize growth while managing tax implications over time.
