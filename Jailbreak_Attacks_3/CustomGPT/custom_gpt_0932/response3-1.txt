Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer matching funds first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: If youâ€™re under 50, you can contribute up to $22,500 (as of 2023), allowing for significant savings.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50) for 2023. Consider using this account for investments with high growth potential.
   
3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals or as an emergency fund.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider holding investments for more than a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to secure any employer match.
- **Utilize Tax Advantage**: Depending on your tax situation, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA.
- **Taxable for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for liquidity if you anticipate needing funds sooner or want to invest in taxable assets.

### Suggested Distribution:
- **Initial Focus**: Max out the 401(k) match, then contribute to an IRA until you reach the annual limit.
- **After Maxing IRA**: Return to the 401(k), contributing as close to the maximum as you can. Invest additional savings in taxable accounts for liquidity.

### Review Regularly:
- Regularly reassess your financial situation, investment performance, and needs to adjust your distribution strategy as necessary. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
