Distributing your money wisely among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a simplified approach:

### 1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This effectively gives you free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA next. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Continue Contributing to 401(k):** After maxing out your IRA, return to your 401(k) to continue contributions, especially if you are under 50 and can contribute the annual limit.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement. They are more flexible, allowing you to access your money without penalties.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax burdens.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, tailoring investments to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Annually review your contributions and allocations based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

### Example Contribution Order:
1. Max out 401(k) match
2. Max out IRA
3. Continue contributing to 401(k) 
4. Contribute to a taxable account
