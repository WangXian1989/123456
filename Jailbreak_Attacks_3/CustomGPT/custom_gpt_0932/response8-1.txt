Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. Focus on Tax-Advantaged Growth
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it may be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. Consider Tax Implications
- **Taxable Accounts**: After funding your retirement accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional investments. This is especially useful for funds you may need before retirement, as they don’t have withdrawal penalties.

### 4. Diversification and Asset Allocation
- Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts. Your risk tolerance and time horizon should guide your allocation.

### 5. Monitor and Adjust
- Reassess your strategy regularly based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals. Make adjustments as needed to stay aligned with your objectives.

### 6. Work with a Professional
- Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

### Conclusion
A good rule of thumb is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA) and then look at taxable accounts for additional investing. Each person's situation is unique, so tailor your approach as necessary.
