Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions to a traditional IRA (if eligible) for tax-deductible benefits, or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments after maxing out retirement accounts. They offer more flexibility.

### 2. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on target-date funds or a mix of stocks and bonds aligned with your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Consider individual stocks or ETFs that fit your long-term strategy; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize taxes on capital gains.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (like 401(k) and traditional IRA): Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Withdrawals are tax-free if conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; long-term investments can be more tax-efficient.

### 4. **Adjust for Timing and Goals**
   - If you're closer to retirement, consider shifting more funds to conservative investments (bonds, etc.) in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - For long-term growth, maintain a higher allocation in stocks within your taxable account.

### 5. **Review and Rebalance**
   - Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution
- **Employer 401(k)**: 15% of income (up to the match)
- **Traditional/Roth IRA**: 10-15% of income (max funding)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 10-20% of income (remaining funds)

### Conclusion
Consider your overall financial picture, seek advice from a financial advisor if necessary, and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or goals.
