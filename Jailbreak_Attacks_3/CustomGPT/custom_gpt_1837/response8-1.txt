Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if you're in a high tax bracket, as contributions are tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Roth IRAs, while not tax-deductible, can offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate regular income (like bonds) because they may be taxed at a lower capital gains rate when sold.

### 3. **Diversify by Account Type**
   - Balance your asset allocation across all accounts, rather than within each account. This maximizes tax efficiency. 
   - Keep in mind that tax rates may change in the future, so consider future tax implications of withdrawals.

### 4. **Revisit Contributions Annually**
   - Adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals. 
   - Rebalance your investment portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Plan for Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Anticipate how and when you'll withdraw funds in retirement, considering tax implications for each account.
   - Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to minimize taxes over your retirement.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your overall financial situation and help you develop a comprehensive plan.

By following these guidelines, you can create a beneficial distribution strategy for your accounts that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
