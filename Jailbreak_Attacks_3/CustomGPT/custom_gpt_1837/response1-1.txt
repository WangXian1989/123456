Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: If possible, max out your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA ($7,500 if youâ€™re over 50).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are similar to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement after contributing with post-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These provide more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Use your 401(k) and IRAs for long-term growth with a mix of stocks and bonds.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding investments that generate tax-efficient income, like index funds or municipal bonds.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund outside of these accounts.

6. **Review Periodically**: Reassess your distribution strategy regularly based on your changing financial circumstances and goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
