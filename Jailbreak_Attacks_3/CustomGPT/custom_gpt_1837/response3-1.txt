Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: Take advantage of the higher contribution limit compared to IRAs.
   - **Investment Choice**: Select investments that align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Benefits**: Consider whether you prefer tax-deferred growth (Traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth IRA).
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and adjust contributions based on income and tax situation.
   - **Diversity in Investments**: Use IRAs to invest in a wider range of assets (stocks, bonds, ETFs) than what may be available in a 401(k).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider tax-efficient investment options (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Investment in Bonds or Real Estate**: This can provide income without impacting your retirement account contribution limits.

### **General Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before investing heavily in retirement accounts.
- **Balance Tax Considerations**: Aim for a balance between tax-deferred growth in retirement accounts and investments in taxable accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically to maintain your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your entire financial picture, investment strategy, and risk tolerance.

### Conclusion
Distributing funds among your accounts strategically enhances growth potential and tax efficiency, setting you up for a more secure financial future.
