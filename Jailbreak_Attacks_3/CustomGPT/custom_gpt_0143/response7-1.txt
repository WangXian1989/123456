To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in Your 401(k)**
   - **Priority**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is essentially free money.
  
### 2. **Fund Your IRA**
   - **Types**: Depending on your income and eligibility, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure youâ€™re aware of annual contribution limits for IRAs.

### 3. **Continue Contributions to Your 401(k)**
   - After maximizing the match, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the contribution limit.

### 4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts can offer flexibility for accessing money without penalties.
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan withdrawals considering tax implications and your tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Asset Location**: Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and bond investments in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - **Rebalance**: Periodically review your allocation and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

### Conclusion
Start with your 401(k) match, then fund your IRA, and finally contribute to taxable accounts, focusing on tax efficiency. Regularly monitor your investments to stay aligned with your financial goals.
