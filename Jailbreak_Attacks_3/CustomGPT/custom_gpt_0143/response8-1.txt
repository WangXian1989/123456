To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for high-income earners.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals. Choose based on your current and future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for flexibility; you can withdraw money anytime without penalties.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on capital gains.
   - Keep income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts since they may be taxed at lower rates (qualified dividends and long-term capital gains).

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved in cash before focusing heavily on investments.

5. **Revisit Regularly**:
   - Review your distribution annually to adjust for changes in income, tax laws, or personal goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals.

This approach helps you maximize growth while managing tax liabilities effectively.
