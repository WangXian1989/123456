Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and age. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, making them ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might want to access before retirement. They provide flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stocks typically offer higher growth potential, suitable for long-term accounts, while bonds may be better for more conservative, short-term needs.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, and hold tax-inefficient assets (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your contributions and allocations based on changes in financial goals or market conditions.

Consult a financial advisor for a personalized strategy that fits your specific situation.
