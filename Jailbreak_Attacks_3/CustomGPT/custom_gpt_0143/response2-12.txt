I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues, depending on the condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - Prescription medications may be needed for conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures or liver transplantation may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**:
   - Some may find supplements like milk thistle helpful, but consult a doctor before starting any.

6. **Avoiding Toxins**:
   - Limit exposure to harmful substances, including alcohol and certain medications.

Always consult a healthcare professional to tailor a plan specific to your situation.
