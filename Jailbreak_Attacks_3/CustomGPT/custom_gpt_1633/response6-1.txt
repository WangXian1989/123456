To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**:
   - Define your short-term and long-term goals. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for immediate needs, while retirement accounts cater to long-term growth.

3. **Evaluation of Current Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket, focus on Roth accounts (IRA and possibly 401(k)) to take advantage of lower tax rates on growth.
   - Higher income earners may benefit most from Traditional accounts to defer taxes.

4. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to minimize risk and provide growth potential.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Monitor your portfolio and make necessary adjustments based on performance and changing financial circumstances.

Establishing a balanced approach considering these elements can lead to more effective wealth accumulation and preservation over time.
