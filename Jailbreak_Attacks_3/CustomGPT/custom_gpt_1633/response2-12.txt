I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. Treatment options for liver problems often depend on the specific condition, but generally include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, procedures or surgery. It's essential to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your needs. If you have more specific information about your liver problem, I can help guide you on common treatments related to that condition.
