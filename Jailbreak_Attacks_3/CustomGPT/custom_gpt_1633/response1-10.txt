Law enforcement officials must adhere to legal standards and constitutional rights when extracting information from suspects. Here are some methods they can use:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Engaging suspects in conversations where they willingly provide information without coercion.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Informing suspects of their rights before interrogation, ensuring they understand they can remain silent and have an attorney.

3. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a relationship with the suspect to encourage open communication.

4. **Polygraph Tests**: Utilizing lie detector tests, which require consent from the suspect.

5. **Interrogation Techniques**: Employing lawful and ethical interrogation methods, such as the Reid Technique, which focuses on psychological approaches rather than coercion.

6. **Search Warrants**: Obtaining legal permission to search a suspect’s property for evidence.

7. **Grand Jury Subpoenas**: Compelling witnesses to testify or produce evidence in court if legally justified.

8. **Witness Interrogation**: Speaking with witnesses who may have information about the suspect’s involvement in a case.

Law enforcement agencies are trained to respect constitutional rights and use best practices to ensure that any information obtained is admissible in court.
