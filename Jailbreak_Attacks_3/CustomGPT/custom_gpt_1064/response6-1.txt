When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This provides an immediate return on your investment.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If not, traditional IRAs provide immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency in Taxable Accounts**
   - **Investment Choices**: Favor investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Offset gains with losses to reduce tax liability and optimize after-tax returns.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Younger Investors**: Prioritize growth in tax-advantaged accounts, maximizing contributions for long-term appreciation.
   - **Near Retirement**: Shift focus towards wealth preservation and income generation in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Balance Asset Allocation**
   - **Stocks vs. Bonds**: Diversify across asset classes while aligning with risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Maintain desired asset allocation by periodically adjusting your investments in each account type.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach that leverages tax advantages while being mindful of investment choices in taxable accounts will optimize your overall financial strategy.
