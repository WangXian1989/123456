The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on a few key factors such as your age, financial goals, tax situation, and employer matching programs. Here’s a general breakdown:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the contribution limits to get the most out of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. If you want tax deductions now, a Traditional IRA might be better.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Fund your IRA up to the limit to take advantage of the tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, which can be useful for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Approach:
- **Prioritize the 401(k)** up to the match.
- **Contribute to an IRA** for additional tax advantages.
- **Invest in taxable accounts** for liquidity and other financial goals.

### Consider Seeking Professional Advice:
It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your personal situation.
