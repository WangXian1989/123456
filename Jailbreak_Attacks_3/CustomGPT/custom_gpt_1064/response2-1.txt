Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum limit, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket, since contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a traditional IRA or Roth IRA next, depending on your tax situation. A traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility and access to funds when needed.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: You can hold tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs here. Avoid high-turnover funds to minimize tax impact.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like municipal bonds, index funds, etc.) to reduce capital gains taxes when you sell.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review your investment allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to managing your investments across these accounts.
