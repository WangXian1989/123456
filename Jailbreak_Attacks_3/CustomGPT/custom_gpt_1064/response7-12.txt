I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), medications may be prescribed to treat the underlying issue.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and tests to monitor liver function can help manage any ongoing issues.

4. **Nutritional Support**: Consulting a dietitian can help optimize your diet for liver health.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation might be necessary.

It's crucial to speak with a healthcare professional for a tailored treatment plan.
