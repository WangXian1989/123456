To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching; contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages; contributions can be deducted depending on income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages; investment income is taxed annually.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, which is essentially free money.

3. **Fund IRAs**:
   - After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If eligible, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in retirement accounts (401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio within each account type and consider your overall asset allocation.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to stay aligned with your financial goals.

7. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Younger investors might favor higher-risk, high-reward investments, whereas older investors typically shift to conservative options.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consult a financial professional.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for long-term growth and efficiency.
