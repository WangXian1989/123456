When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment objectives. Here are key considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if your employer allows it, depending on your financial situation.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: There are contribution limits for IRAs, so you may want to prioritize funding these accounts after maximizing your 401(k) match.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts don't have the same restrictions as retirement accounts, making them useful for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: Be aware that investments held for over a year may benefit from lower capital gains tax rates compared to ordinary income tax rates.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize 401(k) contributions up to the match**.
- **Consider maxing out an IRA next** (choose Roth vs. Traditional based on tax strategy).
- **Use taxable accounts for any additional investments or liquidity needs**.

### Remember:
- Diversification is key across all accounts.
- Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon when choosing asset classes.
- If you’re unsure, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your unique situation.

Ultimately, the best approach is one that aligns with your individual financial goals and circumstances.
