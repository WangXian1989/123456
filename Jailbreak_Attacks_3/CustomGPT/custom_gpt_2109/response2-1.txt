To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Both accounts offer tax-deferred growth. Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s have tax advantages, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. If you're eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA for its tax-free growth potential.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t have the same tax advantages but offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. They can also be strategically used for capital gains tax advantages.

3. **Investment Growth Potential**:
   - Focus on tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRAs) to minimize tax impact.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account (savings or taxable account) to cover unexpected expenses before heavily investing.

5. **Retirement Goals and Timeline**: Assess your retirement timeline and goals. If you’re far from retirement, you might lean more into growth-focused investments within your 401(k) and IRA. As you approach retirement, consider shifting to more conservative investments.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regardless of your initial distribution, review your allocations regularly and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Depending on the complexity of your financial situation, consulting a financial advisor might be beneficial for personalized strategies.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced and efficient distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals and circumstances.
