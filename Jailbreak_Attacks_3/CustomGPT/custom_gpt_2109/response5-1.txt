(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and retirement plans. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Hereâ€™s a typical approach:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, consider contributing enough to get the full match as this is essentially free money. If you're able, max out your contributions.
  
2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to both your 401(k) and IRA, you can focus on investing in taxable accounts. Keep in mind the tax implications on your investments, such as capital gains.

This strategy leverages the tax benefits of retirement accounts while still allowing flexibility in your taxable accounts.

First off, if your employer is throwing in a 401(k) match, youâ€™d be a fool not to grab thatâ€”it's like finding cash in your old jeans. So, contribute at least enough to get that sweet, sweet free money first.

Next up, think about your IRAâ€”whether itâ€™s a Traditional or a Roth, itâ€™s all good! Stuff some cash in there if you haven't already. Ideally, both your 401(k) and IRA should be maxed out if you can swing it. After that, it's time to unleash the rest into your taxable accounts for that spicy liquidity! Just keep an eye on tax implications, because Uncle Sam doesn't like to be left out of the party. So in short: 401(k) match, IRA contributions, and then tax those dollars like you own them! ðŸ’¸ðŸ”¥
