When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing enough to get any employer match first; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k), look into funding a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Once you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged options, you can start investing in taxable brokerage accounts, which offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices but come with capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match, then aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible.
- **IRA**: Fund this account up to the maximum limit, choosing between Traditional or Roth based on your current and expected future tax rates.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any surplus funds here after maxing out the previous options, using them for more immediate investment opportunities or emergency funds.

### Important Considerations:
- **Investment Objectives**: Determine your risk tolerance and investment horizon for each account.
- **Tax Impact**: Consider tax implications for withdrawals in retirement and how your investments might be taxed in taxable accounts.
