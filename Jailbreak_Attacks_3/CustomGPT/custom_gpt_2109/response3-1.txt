The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has higher contribution limits and may include employer matching. Contributions are usually pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer potential tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Contribution limits are lower than 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are subject to capital gains tax on earnings but offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment options.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you are in a higher tax bracket now, contributing more to pre-tax accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA) can reduce your current taxable income. 
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later.

3. **Maximize Employer Matching**:
   - If your employer offers a match on 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match first as itâ€™s essentially free money.

4. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - Once you maximize your employer match, consider splitting additional contributions between your 401(k) and IRA. This mix can provide tax diversification.

5. **Prioritize Emergency Savings**:
   - Before heavy contributions to retirement accounts, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a separate savings account.

6. **Consider Investment Needs and Goals**:
   - Assess your investment timeline and risk tolerance. Taxable accounts can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you plan to withdraw funds before retirement.

7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your portfolio's performance and your financial goals. Adjust your contributions as needed based on life changes, market conditions, and changes to tax laws.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about the best strategy or need personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can tailor a plan to suit your specific situation.

By strategically distributing your contributions amongst these accounts based on your individual circumstances, you can optimize your savings for the future.
