The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing the maximum amount to your 401(k). This is especially beneficial if your 401(k) has lower fees or good investment options.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your tax situation. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, while a Traditional IRA is good for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out your accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This offers flexibility but be mindful of tax implications, particularly on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate.

6. **Fund Allocation**: Allocate funds based on risk tolerance—more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts where you're less likely to need quick access, and more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

7. **Tax Considerations**: Remember to take tax implications into account. For example, placing taxable bond funds in tax-advantaged accounts can help minimize taxes.

8. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that works best for your personal financial situation.
