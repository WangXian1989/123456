Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Before allocating money to retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of living expenses.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer matches contributions, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to benefit from potential tax advantages. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investment after maximizing contributions to retirement accounts. This is helpful for flexibility, as funds can be accessed without penalties prior to retirement age.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts. Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable accounts and higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.
