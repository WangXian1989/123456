Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income in the year you contribute. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is a good option if you believe your tax rate will be higher in the future.

3. **Diversify Across Accounts**: 
   - Use the 401(k) for pre-tax contributions and potentially match contributions.
   - Fund a Roth IRA if you're eligible, which allows for tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity for investments that may not benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have adequate liquid savings before maxing out retirement accounts. Generally, having 3-6 months of living expenses is recommended.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stocks may be suitable for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments could be placed in taxable accounts.

6. **Review Annually or Semi-Annually**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contribution levels as your financial situation, goals, and investment performance change.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, it's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can help tailor a plan to your specific circumstances.

The right allocation will depend on your unique situation, so consider these factors carefully when planning your contributions.
