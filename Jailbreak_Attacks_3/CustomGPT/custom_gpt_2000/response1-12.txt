I'm not a doctor, but I can share that treatment options for liver problems can vary widely depending on the specific condition you're facing (like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.). Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medication, or in severe cases, surgery. It's crucial that you consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice based on your medical history and current health status. Always prioritize speaking with a doctor for accurate guidance!
