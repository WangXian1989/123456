Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Focus on maximizing contributions to benefit from tax-deferred growth, particularly if you're in a higher tax bracket now.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Assess whether a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) or a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) is better for your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Diversification of Tax Impact**: Having both a taxable account and tax-advantaged accounts can provide flexibility in managing withdrawals and tax implications in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Consider keeping funds in taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you expect to need access to your money before retirement.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Opt for tax-efficient investments in these accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **Contribute Enough to 401(k) for Maximum Match**: Initial focus on this for the employer contribution.
- **Prioritize IRA Contribution**: Max out your IRA if possible; it offers valuable tax benefits.
- **Allocate Remaining Funds to Taxable Accounts**: Use any leftover funds for short-term needs or flexible investments.

### Final Thoughts:
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in financial goals or circumstances.
- Consult a financial advisor to personalize the strategy further based on your specific situation.
