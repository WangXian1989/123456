Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations and recommendations:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with tax-deferred contributions. Often includes matching contributions from your employer.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Also tax-advantaged but with different contribution limits and options (Traditional versus Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but offer flexibility for withdrawals. Capital gains tax applies to earnings.

2. **Determine Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) to benefit from any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Contribute to an IRA if eligible, considering both Traditional and Roth options based on your income level and tax strategy.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth accounts (Roth IRA or after-tax contributions in your 401(k)).
   - For lower current income, Traditional accounts may provide immediate tax benefits.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Align your investments with your risk tolerance and timeline. Generally, more aggressive investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts due to deferred taxes.
   - For taxable accounts, consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or tax-exempt bonds).

5. **Diversify Across Accounts**:
   - Ensure diversification within each account, spreading investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, alternatives).
   - Maintain a holistic view of your entire portfolio for effective asset allocation.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio as your financial situation changes, including changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

**Sample Distribution Strategy**:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize employer match, then assess further contributions based on tax advantages.
- **IRA**: Max out if eligible, particularly Roth IRA if expecting a higher future tax burden.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Consider this as a secondary savings option after retirement accounts, focusing on long-term growth.

In summary, maximize tax-advantaged contributions first, diversify your investments, and reassess your strategy regularly based on your financial goals.
