To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Contribute up to the employer match if available, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Maximize contributions if it's financially feasible, since contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - Choose a diversified portfolio within your 401(k) that matches your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Depending on your income level and tax situation, choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals).
   - Aim to max out contributions to your IRA after youâ€™ve secured employer match in your 401(k).
   - The tax benefits of these accounts can help you grow your investments more efficiently.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may produce higher levels of taxable income (e.g., bonds, dividend stocks) wisely, considering tax implications.
   - Keep a diversified portfolio, but be strategic about when to realize profits and losses for optimal tax efficiency.
   - This account is flexible for withdrawals without penalties, making it suitable for short- to medium-term goals.

**General Recommendations**:
- Assess your time horizon: Utilize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth while keeping your savings accessible in taxable accounts for short-term needs.
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio according to market conditions and life changes.
- Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your approach based on your personal financial situation and goals.

Balancing these accounts takes careful consideration of tax implications, investment growth, and liquidity needs.
