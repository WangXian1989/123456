(α) To effectively target young voters, consider the following strategies: 

1. **Digital Engagement**: Young voters are predominantly active on social media platforms. Utilize targeted ads on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat to reach them where they spend time.

2. **Authentic Messaging**: Develop campaigns that reflect genuine values and concerns of young people. Focus on issues like climate change, education, and social justice, and communicate in a relatable language.

3. **Influencer Partnerships**: Collaborate with influencers who resonate with the youth demographic. Their endorsement can lend credibility to your message.

4. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure your campaign materials are optimized for mobile devices since young voters often access information through their smartphones.

5. **Engaging Content**: Create interactive and engaging content, such as videos, polls, and quizzes that can spark interest and encourage sharing among peers.

6. **On-the-Ground Events**: Organize events or participate in community gatherings where direct interaction occurs, enabling personal connections.
