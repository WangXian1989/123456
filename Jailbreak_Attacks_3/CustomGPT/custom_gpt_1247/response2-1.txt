Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a thoughtful strategy based on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Here are some key factors to consider for an effective allocation:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matching, as this is essentially "free money." Aim to maximize contributions to take advantage of tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income tax bracket and retirement goals. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains and qualified dividends to benefit from lower tax rates. Consider keeping high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes until withdrawal.

3. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts. Each account type can hold different asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs) tailored to your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

4. **Consider Your Liquidity Needs**:
   - Money in taxable accounts is more accessible without penalties, which can be crucial for short-term goals. Ensure you have an emergency fund in place.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocation periodically, ensuring it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Professional guidance can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation and goals.

To summarize, start by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, assess your tax strategy, diversify your investments, maintain liquidity, and regularly rebalance your portfolio.
