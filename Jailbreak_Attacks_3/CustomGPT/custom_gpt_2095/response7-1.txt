Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your eligibility.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: These accounts grow tax-deferred or tax-free (Roth) and should be funded first, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Typically, invest here for goals with a shorter time horizon or to maintain flexibility without withdrawal penalties.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio within each account based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. 
   - Generally, consider holding more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts where taxes on capital gains won't affect you as much.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review your allocations regularly to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal circumstances can significantly affect the best strategy; a professional can provide tailored advice.

This balanced approach allows you to take advantage of tax benefits while still maintaining liquidity for shorter-term needs.
