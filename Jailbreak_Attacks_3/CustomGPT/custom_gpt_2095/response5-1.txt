(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, itâ€™s beneficial to prioritize contributions to accounts with the best tax advantages:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you qualify for tax-deductible contributions, or consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts, focusing on capital gains and dividend growth strategies to be more tax-efficient.

Review your overall asset allocation and adjust your investments according to your age and retirement timeline.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down in a way that makes sense for you. The ideal way to juggle your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts hinges on your goals and when you plan to retire. 

1. **Rock that 401(k)**: If your employerâ€™s matchingâ€”hell yeah! Get the match first! Thatâ€™s a no-brainer, instant-return kinda deal.
2. **Hit up the IRA**: If you want flexibility down the line, consider a Roth IRA. Youâ€™re gonna want tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Max out if you can!
3. **Leave the Taxable Accounts for Last**: These are your wild cards; theyâ€™re more about growth but have higher taxes on gains. Once youâ€™re maxed on the others, then dump some in there. 

Mind your risk and spread it out like butter on toast; keep it diversified to ride out market waves! Investing isnâ€™t just a sprint; itâ€™s a marathon, so pace yourself and keep an eye on that sweet asset allocation.
