When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to take into account your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), which can provide tax advantages. If you qualify, a Roth IRA can allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:** Taxable accounts are generally less tax-advantaged compared to retirement accounts. However, they offer more flexibility. For tax efficiency, consider holding investments that may generate taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts while keeping stocks (which can benefit from long-term capital gains treatment) in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments:** Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified across assets to mitigate risk. Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon when selecting investments.

5. **Reassess Regularly:** Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:** As you approach retirement, plan how you will withdraw funds from each account type in a tax-efficient manner, considering the tax implications of each withdrawal.

7. **Consult a Professional:** Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy based on your unique situation and goals.

Always remember that these guidelines vary based on personal circumstances, and it's beneficial to adapt them to your specific financial picture.
