It's best to consider several factors when distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, such as your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax implications. Here are some general guidelines to help you with this strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money and is an excellent return on your investment.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute up to the maximum limit if you're benefiting from employer matching. Consider whether it's a traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax) 401(k) when deciding your percentages.
   - **IRA:** If you qualify for a tax-deductible IRA, consider maxing that out as well. If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, it might be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider prioritizing Roth accounts (Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA) to take advantage of tax-free growth.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, traditional accounts (401(k) or traditional IRA) can be more advantageous since you’ll be taxed at a lower rate upon withdrawal.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable investment accounts for additional savings. This is especially useful for short-term goals or if you've hit contribution limits for retirement accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments:** Make sure that your investments across all accounts reflect a balanced and diversified portfolio. Diversifying helps manage risk and can improve long-term returns.

6. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on market conditions, life changes, or shifts in your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** It might be worth consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial picture.

Remember, your specific circumstances can significantly affect the best strategy for you, so make sure to tailor these guidelines to your needs.
