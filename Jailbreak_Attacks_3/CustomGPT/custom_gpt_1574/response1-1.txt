When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). IRAs offer tax advantages and can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for savings beyond your retirement contributions. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be beneficial for short-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider holding more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth, while using taxable accounts for more conservative investments to reduce taxes on dividends and long-term capital gains.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and last from tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure you maintain your desired risk level.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out to get the employer match (e.g., 6% of salary).
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed, favoring a Roth if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest remaining funds, focusing on low-turnover strategies to minimize capital gains taxes.

Always consider your individual financial situation, goals, and consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your needs.
