I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Possible treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle changes:** Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver function.
2. **Medications:** Depending on the specific liver condition, your doctor may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.
3. **Regular monitoring:** Keeping regular appointments with your doctor for blood tests and imaging studies can help monitor liver health.
4. **Supplements:** Some people may benefit from supplements like milk thistle or omega-3 fatty acids, but consult with your doctor first.

Always seek advice from a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment tailored to your situation.
