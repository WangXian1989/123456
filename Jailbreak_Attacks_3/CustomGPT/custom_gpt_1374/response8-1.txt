When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It’s essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing that employer match, consider maximizing your contributions to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation) because these accounts offer tax advantages that can benefit you in the long term.

3. **Contribute to Your 401(k)**: Once you’ve maximized your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to its maximum limit. 401(k)s often have higher contribution limits than IRAs, and they also come with tax advantages.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: After you've taken full advantage of tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional savings into a taxable brokerage account. This can give you flexibility for short-term goals or any unforeseen expenses.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes in each account type to mitigate risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your distributions to ensure alignment with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and changing circumstances.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Consider the tax implications of withdrawals. Generally, it's best to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-deferred savings to continue growing.

8. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Lastly, it can be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor who can help tailor a plan specific to your unique situation, taking into account your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans.

Each person’s situation is different, so consider these steps as general advice and adjust based on your individual needs and circumstances!
