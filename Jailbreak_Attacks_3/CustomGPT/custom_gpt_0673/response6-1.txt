Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or consider a traditional IRA for possible tax deductions.

### 2. **Balance for Flexibility and Growth:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest funds here once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. This account offers liquidity and flexibility but comes with capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **High-Growth Assets in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Hold higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - **Income-Producing Assets in Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends and interest.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term:** More aggressive allocations in retirement accounts.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep more liquid and conservative investments in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across accounts to ensure alignment with your long-term investment goals and risk tolerance.

### Summary:
- **Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs** before funding taxable accounts.
- **Select investment types based on tax implications** and time horizon.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation and goals.
