To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max out employer-sponsored 401(k)** contributions, especially if thereâ€™s a matching contribution. This is essentially "free money."
   - After your 401(k), focus on funding a Roth or traditional IRA, which offer significant tax advantages.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Use taxable accounts** for investments that produce interest income or short-term capital gains, as these are taxed at ordinary income rates.
   - Consider holding **dividend-paying stocks** or long-term investments in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Reserve safer investments (like bonds) for taxable accounts to avoid high taxes on interest income.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balance of asset classes across all accounts to optimize growth potential while managing risk.

By following these strategies, you can maximize growth and minimize tax liabilities effectively. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.
