I'm not a medical professional, but the best course of action for liver problems often depends on the specific condition you're facing. Generally, treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This can include a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, certain medications may be prescribed.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and the progression of the disease.
4. **Supportive Treatments**: This might involve managing symptoms and complications.
5. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgical interventions like liver transplant may be necessary.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plans. Please take care of your health!
