To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**: Define your short-term and long-term financial goals, including retirement plans, major purchases, or education funding.

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions and tax advantages. It's generally suitable for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax benefits and can be a good supplement to a 401(k). Traditional IRAs may provide tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More flexible for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes on earnings. Ideal for short-term savings or investment goals.

3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. Maximize contributions to employer-sponsored plans (like your 401(k) with a match) before diverting funds to IRAs or taxable accounts.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to minimize immediate tax liabilities.
   - Assess whether a Roth IRA conversion makes sense based on your current vs. future tax bracket.

5. **Strategize for Diversification**: Distribute investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts for balanced risk.

6. **Review Investment Options**: Each account may have different investment options. Ensure that the choices align with your overall investment strategy.

7. **Adjust Based on Life Changes**: Periodically review and adjust your account distributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

In conclusion, a balanced approach could involve maximizing your 401(k) contributions for employer matching, contributing to an IRA, and then using any additional funds for taxable accounts, depending on your financial situation and goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor your strategy effectively.
