Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on them until you withdraw the money in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket then.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. If you believe your tax rate will be higher in the future, focusing on Roth accounts can be wise.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments. They offer flexibility since you can withdraw funds without penalties.

3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Start with getting the full company match in your 401(k).
   - Next, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation.
   - Finally, use any additional funds to invest in your taxable account, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure you have a diversified investment strategy aligned with your risk tolerance across all accounts.

5. **Adjust Over Time**: As you grow older or your financial situation changes, review and adjust your contributions and investment strategies accordingly.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.
