I’m not a doctor, but I can give you some general options that people often consider for liver issues. It’s really important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common treatment options depending on the specific liver condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid processed foods and excessive fats.
   - **Alcohol Abstinence:** Avoid alcohol completely, as it can worsen liver damage.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antiviral Medications:** For conditions like hepatitis B or C.
   - **Corticosteroids:** To reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - **Check-Ups:** Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and health.

4. **Surgery:**
   - **Liver Transplant:** In severe cases, when the liver is significantly damaged.

5. **Supplements:**
   - **Milk Thistle:** Some believe it may help improve liver health, but consult a doctor before starting any supplement.

It's crucial to see a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your situation. They can provide tailored recommendations based on your medical history and current health status.
