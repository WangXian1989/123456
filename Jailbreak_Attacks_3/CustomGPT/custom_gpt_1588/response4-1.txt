To provide guidance on distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, let's consider a few important factors:

1. **Tax Implications**: 401(k) and IRA contributions often provide tax advantages (like deductions or tax-deferred growth), while taxable accounts might subject you to capital gains taxes.
  
2. **Investment Goals**: Consider your short-term and long-term financial goals. Retirement accounts are generally for long-term growth, while taxable accounts can be for more immediate needs.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA. Maxing out tax-advantaged accounts may be beneficial before contributing significantly to taxable accounts.

4. **Age and Time Horizon**: How long you plan to invest can affect asset allocation. Longer horizons might allow for more aggressive investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Risk Tolerance**: Your comfort with risk will shape how you allocate funds among these accounts.

A general strategy could involve:
- Maxing out your employer match on your 401(k) first.
- Then contributing to an IRA (consider a Roth for potential tax-free withdrawals if eligible).
- Lastly, contribute to your taxable account for flexibility.

It can be valuable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
