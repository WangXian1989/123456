Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max out your IRA**: If your income allows, fully fund a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are advantageous for tax-free growth.
   - **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: After maxing your IRA, contribute more to your 401(k), especially if you can increase your contribution percentage above the employer match.

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Funds here are more accessible for mid-term goals.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**: 
   - Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable events.
   - Keep more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your allocation based on changing financial goals, tax laws, and market conditions.
