Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be strategic for optimizing growth and minimizing taxes. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match and IRA contributions, increase your 401(k) contributions. This plan usually has higher annual limits than IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity. This is also beneficial if you've maxed out retirement accounts but want to keep investing.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to balance risk and return. Consider asset allocation based on age, risk tolerance, and financial goals.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications. For instance, interest from bonds in taxable accounts can be less favorable than in tax-advantaged accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor is often beneficial for tailored advice based on your specific situation.
