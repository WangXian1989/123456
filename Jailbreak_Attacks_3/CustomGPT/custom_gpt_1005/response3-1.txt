To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out your employer match first.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and projected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income, like dividends or interest.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term vs. long-term needs. Taxable accounts are better for goals within 5 years, while retirement accounts are suited for long-term growth.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Stay aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000, and the IRA limit is $6,500 (with catch-up contributions for those over 50).

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify across account types based on risk tolerance. Higher-risk investments may be better in tax-advantaged accounts to shield gains from taxes.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review asset allocations and adjust based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider how and when you will withdraw funds in retirement. Strategies may differ based on account types and their tax implications.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation, ensuring it aligns with your financial goals and tax circumstances.
