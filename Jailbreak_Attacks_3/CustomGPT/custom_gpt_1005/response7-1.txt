To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Are you saving for retirement, a home, or another major purchase?

### 2. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Generally offers higher contribution limits and potential employer matches. Contributions are pre-tax or Roth after-tax.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Lower contribution limits, but offers tax advantages. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but provide flexibility for withdrawals and investing.

### 3. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 4. **Prioritize Roth IRA if Eligible**
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider funding this account after maximizing your 401(k) match. This allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Evaluate the tax implications of each account. For example, placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in a Roth IRA can be beneficial since you wonâ€™t pay taxes on gains.

### 6. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure you diversify your investments across all accounts. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets, aligning with your risk tolerance.

### 7. **Regular Contributions**
   - Set up automatic contributions to ensure consistent funding. Regularly review and adjust based on changes in income and financial goals.

### 8. **Periodic Rebalancing**
   - Regularly assess the performance of your investments and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Summary
A common strategy could be:
- Max out your 401(k) to get the employer match.
- Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible.
- Use any remaining funds for a taxable account, especially for investments you might need to access sooner.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation can also be helpful.
