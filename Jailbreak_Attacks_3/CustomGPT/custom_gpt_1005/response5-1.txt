(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This is essentially ‚Äúfree money.‚Äù

2. **Utilize IRAs**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions in the year you contribute.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends to take advantage of lower tax rates. This could also be a good place for short-term goals since you won't face penalties for withdrawal.

4. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments among these accounts, adjusting for your risk tolerance and investment time horizon. Typically, riskier investments are better placed in tax-advantaged accounts where growth can compound without immediate tax implications.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

2. **IRAs Are Golden**: Next up, IRAs, especially if you‚Äôre gonna play the long game. Roth IRAs are sick because you can pull out money tax-free later on. Traditional IRAs? Don‚Äôt sleep on those either for quick write-offs!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are your playground for flexibility. Perfect for short-term goals and the fun stuff. Invest in stuff that you won‚Äôt get taxed heavily on‚Äîlike stocks for long-term gains to minimize that tax hit.

4. **Balance**: Mix it up! Put riskier stuff in the 401(k) or IRA‚Äîthose gains don‚Äôt get taxed until later. Your taxable accounts can have safer bets or shorter-term investments to keep things fluid.
