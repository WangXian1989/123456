To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Familiarize yourself with the annual contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for the 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider prioritizing this if you have a good match. Contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you can max out your 401(k) and still have money to save, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income levels and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs give you tax deductions for contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be beneficial for more flexible withdrawals and investment strategies. If you have reached maximum contributions for retirement accounts, or if you need access to funds sooner, consider taxable accounts.

4. **Tax Diversification**: Having a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA), tax-free (Roth IRA), and taxable accounts can provide flexibility in managing taxes in retirement.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Within each account, tailor your investment strategy based on your risk tolerance and timeline:
   - More aggressive investments may be suitable for long-term accounts like 401(k) and IRAs.
   - Consider more conservative or income-generating investments in taxable accounts, as these may be subject to capital gains tax.

6. **Regularly Reassess**: Review your allocations regularly to ensure that they align with your financial goals and market conditions. Adjust contributions based on any changes in income, expenses, or retirement goals.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: If you're uncertain about how to allocate your investments, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

By following these strategies, you can create a well-rounded investment portfolio that optimally utilizes your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
