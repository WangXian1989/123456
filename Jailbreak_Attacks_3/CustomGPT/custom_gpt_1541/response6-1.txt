When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account your individual financial goals, timeline, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy you can consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions for additional tax benefits. Depending on your income, you might choose between a Traditional or Roth IRA.

2. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to a taxable account for more accessible funds. This can be beneficial for short-term goals or emergency savings.
   - Keep in mind that investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes, so focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds).

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. For long-term accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA), you might lean towards growth-oriented assets like stocks.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding lower-turnover investments like ETFs or index funds to minimize tax impact.

4. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

By strategically distributing your investments across these accounts, you can optimize growth while managing tax implications. Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific needs.
