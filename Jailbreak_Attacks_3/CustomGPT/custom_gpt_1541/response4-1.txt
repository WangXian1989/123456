To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize any employer match first, if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing up to the annual limit if it fits within your budget, as 401(k)s often have higher contribution limits than IRAs.

2. **Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA**:
   - If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, consider using a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA might be beneficial for tax-deferred growth.
   - Keep in mind the contribution limits for both types of IRAs and your eligibility based on income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for money you may need in the short term, or for investments that may benefit from capital gains taxes which are often lower than ordinary income tax rates.
   - Consider holding investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in taxable accounts to minimize the tax hit.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Determine your risk tolerance and investment goals to create a balanced allocation among stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - Generally, you may want to hold more aggressive assets like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred, while bond-heavy investments may be better placed in a taxable account where interest may be taxed at higher rates.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals, especially after significant market movements.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy ahead of time, considering the tax implications of withdrawing from different accounts at various stages in retirement.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your unique situation and goals.
