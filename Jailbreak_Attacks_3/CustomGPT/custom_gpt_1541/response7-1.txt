When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to keep in mind. 

1. **Tax Considerations**: Contributing to a 401(k) or traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits as contributions can often be made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) grow tax-free, but contributions are made post-tax. A taxable account offers no tax benefits now but allows for more flexibility later.

2. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, it's often wise to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match before directing funds elsewhere. This is essentially “free money.”

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Consider your investment goals and time horizon. If you are saving for retirement, long-term growth may be prioritized in tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, a taxable account may provide the liquidity you need.

4. **Withdrawal Rules and Penalties**: Be mindful of the withdrawal rules and penalties associated with each account. Early withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs can incur penalties, while funds in a taxable account can be more readily accessible without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes and account types to help manage risk effectively.

In summary, a general approach is to max out any employer match in your 401(k), then contribute to an IRA for additional tax benefits, and use taxable accounts for more flexibility, especially if you have specific short-term goals.
