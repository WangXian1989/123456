To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the match, then consider your next steps based on investment options and fees.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions for contributions, which may be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid account.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These provide flexibility for withdrawals and can hold investments that generate favorable long-term capital gains.

5. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - **Tax-inefficient investments** (like bonds or REITs) should generally be placed in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Tax-efficient investments** (like index funds) can be kept in taxable accounts.

6. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Monitor your investment performance and asset allocation periodically and adjust based on changes in your financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

Remember, your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals will influence the ideal distribution strategy.
