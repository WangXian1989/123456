Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional) next. IRAs often provide more investment choices and tax advantages.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Best for investments that generate high levels of taxable income (like bonds) since you won’t pay taxes on this income until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Good for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diversified allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.
