Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts may be subject to capital gains tax when sold. They can be used for mid-term goals or emergency funds, as they provide flexibility.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk. For example, consider holding bonds in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact, while keeping stocks in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement carefully to minimize taxes. Generally, draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or Traditional IRA), and finally, tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA).

5. **Review Regularly**: 
   - Periodically reassess your allocations to ensure they align with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - A professional can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation, including tax strategies and retirement planning.

By strategically using these accounts, you can work toward a balanced and tax-efficient investment approach.
