To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:**
     - Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
     - Consider contributing to the maximum limit allowed if financially feasible, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA Contributions:**
     - If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Additionally, Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions.
     - Contribute the maximum allowed to leverage tax benefits.

### 2. **Optimize Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Investments with Lower Tax Impact:**
     - Focus on tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs that will generate lower capital gains.
     - Consider holding bond investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes on interest income.

### 3. **Consider Your Financial Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - Align your investment strategy with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon for each account type.
   - For retirement accounts, consider a longer-term strategy focused on growth.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for shorter-term goals with more liquid, less risky investments.

### 4. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**
   - Monitor the performance of your investments across all accounts regularly and rebalance as necessary to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and investment strategy.
   - Adjust your contributions based on changes in your financial situation or tax laws.

By maintaining a balanced approach and staying informed on tax implications, you can strategically grow your wealth across all accounts. If in doubt, consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique financial situation.
