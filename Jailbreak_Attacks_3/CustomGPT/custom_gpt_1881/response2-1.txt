Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**  
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA (if eligible) to take advantage of tax benefits. For 2023, the contribution limits are $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**  
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** Taxes are paid upon withdrawal, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Youâ€™ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, but you have more flexibility with withdrawals.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**  
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on retirement-focused investments like index funds or target-date funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider using tax-efficient investments like ETFs or municipal bonds to minimize tax impacts.

### 4. **Emergency Funds**  
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity in your taxable accounts for emergencies before fully funding retirement accounts.

### 5. **Long-Term Goals**  
   - Align your investment choices with your timeline. If you're far from retirement, consider a more aggressive strategy. Nearing retirement? Shift to conservative investments to preserve capital.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**  
   - Periodically review your allocation strategy to adjust based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy  
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your income (enough to get the match)  
- **IRA:** Max out at $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50)  
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate funds for short-term needs or additional long-term investments after maxing retirement accounts.
