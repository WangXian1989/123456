I'm sorry to hear you're dealing with liver issues. Itâ€™s essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. However, here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats can support liver health.
   - **Hydration**: Drinking plenty of water helps your liver function efficiently.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and reduce liver fat.

2. **Medications**: Depending on your specific condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver, or cirrhosis), your doctor may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or address the underlying cause.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Alcohol can exacerbate liver problems, so abstaining is often recommended.

4. **Monitoring and Managing Medical Conditions**: Keeping conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol under control can help protect liver health.

5. **Regular Check-Ups**: Regular doctor visits for monitoring liver function tests can help catch any issues early.

For a tailored treatment plan, it's best to speak directly with a healthcare provider.
