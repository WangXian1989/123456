Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, allowing your investment to grow tax-free until retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect your tax rate to rise in the future, prioritize funding a Roth IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income. This is also a good place for emergency savings, as these funds are accessible without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment strategy remains diversified across different asset classesâ€”a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments across all accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investments and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially as market conditions change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can tailor strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a well-rounded investment strategy that maximizes your growth potential while considering tax implications.
