Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, income, investment goals, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) contribution (up to $22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if over 50), consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA (also $6,500 for 2024, or $7,500 if over 50). 

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRAs) for investments that generate high taxable income (e.g., bonds, REITs), as these will grow tax-deferred.
   - Taxable accounts are better for assets that experience lower turnover and may benefit from long-term capital gains treatment (like stock index funds).

### 3. **Diversify Your Investments:**
   - Balance your asset allocation across all accounts based on your risk tolerance. This could include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Reevaluate your asset allocation periodically and adjust contributions to maintain your desired risk level.

### 5. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline:**
   - If you’re close to retirement, prioritize more secure assets in your 401(k) and IRA to preserve capital.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of your salary up to the employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you're eligible.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate remaining funds, focusing on long-term growth investments.

### Final Thoughts:
Tailor your strategy to your unique financial situation. It may be helpful to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your circumstances.
