It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. However, some general treatment options include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and limit saturated fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), different medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help monitor the condition.

4. **Manage Underlying Conditions**: Control diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some patients find relief with herbal supplements or acupuncture, but these should be discussed with a doctor.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a treatment plan tailored to your specific situation.
