To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth; contributions are pre-tax. Some employers offer matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax on profits; provide flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is effectively free money.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Contribute to your 401(k)** up to the employer match first.
   - Then, consider maximizing contributions to an IRA before returning to your 401(k) if you have additional funds. 

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens (like ETFs or index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow, rebalance your portfolio across account types to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Consider tax consequences in retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.

Implementing a balanced approach tailored to your needs and financial goals will help optimize your investment growth and minimize taxes over time.
