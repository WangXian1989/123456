Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations to help guide your decisions:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income. Employers may offer matching contributions, which can enhance growth. Consider maxing out your contribution, especially if there’s a match available.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages either through pre-tax (Traditional IRA) or post-tax (Roth IRA) contributions. IRAs usually have a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These allow for greater flexibility and liquidity. However, you pay taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains. Use these for funds you may need before retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Investment Goals**
   - If your goal is long-term retirement savings, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to harness compounding growth.
   - For short-term goals or needs, consider keeping more money in taxable accounts for easier access.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, favor Roth accounts (like Roth IRA) where withdrawals are tax-free. 
   - Balance your investments to manage tax liabilities; placing income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts can minimize taxes owed.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance across all accounts. Stocks may work well for long-term growth, while bonds can provide stability.

### 5. **Regularly Review Your Strategy**
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation and contributions as your financial situation and market conditions change. 

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. **Fund IRAs**: Contribute to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits.
3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out the IRA, direct additional savings to your 401(k).
4. **Taxable Accounts Last**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts as needed for liquidity or specific investments that don’t fit into tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
Your specific distribution will depend on personal circumstances, including income levels, tax strategies, and financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
