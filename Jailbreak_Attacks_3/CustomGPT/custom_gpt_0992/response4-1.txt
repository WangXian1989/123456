Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—that’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Bracket**: If you are in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement, a Roth IRA may be preferable. Conversely, if you’re in a lower tax bracket, traditional accounts may allow for more immediate tax savings.
   - **Withdrawal Needs**: Keep in mind that taxable accounts are more flexible for withdrawals without penalties.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Allocate a mix of investments across accounts based on risk tolerance and investment horizon. For example, consider holding growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on higher returns.
   - **Bond Holdings**: Bonds might be better suited for taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on capital gains when compared to ordinary income tax rates.

### 4. **Regularly Reassess Your Allocation**
   - **Life Changes**: As your financial situation changes (such as changing jobs, getting married, or nearing retirement), reassess your allocation to ensure it matches your current goals.
   - **Performance Reviews**: Periodically review your investment performance and make adjustments as needed to stay aligned with your strategy.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you’re unsure about your strategy, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances and goals.
