Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to obtain any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Traditional vs. Roth:**
   - **401(k):** If it’s a traditional 401(k), contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If you have a Roth 401(k) option, consider contributing to it for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA:** Similarly, decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). If eligible, max out contributions to either type.

3. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA):** These accounts grow tax-deferred. Prioritize funding these before taxable accounts, especially for long-term investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments likely to generate capital gains or income, as they will be taxed in the year earned. Consider holding tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, in this account.

4. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you maintain an emergency fund outside of these accounts for liquidity. This will prevent you from needing to withdraw from retirement accounts prematurely.

5. **Long-Term Goals:** Adjust your contributions based on your financial goals:
   - If you aim for substantial retirement savings, prioritize 401(k) and IRA accounts.
   - For medium-term goals or liquidity, allocate more to taxable accounts.

6. **Diversification:** Balance your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account for risk management.

7. **Reassess Regularly:** Monitor your portfolio and adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

In summary, focus on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA), then allocate surplus funds to taxable accounts based on liquidity needs and investment goals. It's also wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
