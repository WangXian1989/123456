Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax bracket. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Balance Risk and Liquidity:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term goals or investments that might generate taxable income. They provide liquidity, which is crucial for emergency funds or short-term expenses.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Investment Type:** Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or capital gains, which may be taxed at lower rates.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Future:**
   - Consider your anticipated retirement tax bracket. Allocating more funds into tax-deferred accounts may be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

### 5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This includes balancing between asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risks.

### Summary:
- **Maximize employer match in 401(k)**
- **Consider tax implications for investment types**
- **Diversify across all accounts**

By structuring your investments with these considerations, you can optimize your growth potential while managing risks and tax liabilities effectively. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
