I'm not a doctor, but when it comes to liver issues, treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, quitting alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly impact liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver problem (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), doctors might prescribe antiviral medications or corticosteroids.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation might be necessary.

5. **Supplements and Herbs**: Some people find certain supplements beneficial, but always consult a healthcare provider before starting any.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan.
