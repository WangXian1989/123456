Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA since they offer tax benefits. If your employer matches contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match.

2. **Funds for Immediate Needs**: Utilize taxable accounts for money you may need in the short term. They provide easier access without penalties for withdrawals.

3. **Consider Tax Bracket**: If you're in a lower tax bracket now, it might be beneficial to prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, while higher earners may benefit more from traditional accounts for upfront tax deductions.

4. **Diversification**: Make sure you're diversifying your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance periodically to stay aligned with your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's often best to get personalized advice based on your unique situation.

Consider your long-term goals and consult a financial professional for tailored advice.
