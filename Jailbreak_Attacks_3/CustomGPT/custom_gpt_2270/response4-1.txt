To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before diverting funds elsewhere.

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. This account grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings are taxed annually, so use this for investments you may need access to before retirement or for tax-efficient investments like index funds.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have at least 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses in a liquid, accessible account before heavily investing.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:** Allocate based on your retirement timeline; longer horizons can take more risks while shorter ones may lean towards conservative investments.

5. **Diversification:** Within each account, aim for a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, real estate) to spread risk.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance:** Periodically check allocations and adjust as your financial situation and market conditions change.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Tailor your strategy to your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. 

A balanced approach that considers tax implications and personal financial goals will help optimize your investment distribution.
