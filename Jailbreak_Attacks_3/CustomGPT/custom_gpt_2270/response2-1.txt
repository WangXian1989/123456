Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth.

3. **Max Out 401(k):** After getting the match, consider maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments that may not fit into your retirement accounts, like short-term savings, or if you've maxed out your other accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-managed funds.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, retirement accounts can have more aggressive allocations (like stocks), while taxable accounts can hold more conservative investments or bonds.

6. **Tax Strategies:** Consider the tax implications of withdrawals from each type of account. Generally, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### Example Distribution Strategy

- **401(k):** 15-20% of your salary to max out contributions or get the match.
- **IRA:** $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) annually.
- **Taxable Account:** Any remaining funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### Review Regularly

Reassess your strategy annually based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions. Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a plan to your specific needs and circumstances.
