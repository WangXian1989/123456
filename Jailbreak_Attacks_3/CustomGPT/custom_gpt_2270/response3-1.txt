Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match—it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize this account first. Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. Consider low-turnover index funds or municipal bonds to minimize taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investment portfolio is diversified to manage risk.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

6. **Withdrawals and Taxes**: Plan for your withdrawals to minimize tax impact during retirement. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first may be beneficial.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
