I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver health. Treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition, but here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Avoid alcohol.
   - Follow a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Management of Underlying Conditions**:
   - Control diabetes, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure as needed.

5. **Advanced Treatments**:
   - In severe cases, liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
