Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **401(k):** 
   - **Maximize Contributions:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match firstâ€”it's free money!
   - **Consider Investment Options:** Choose diversified investment options that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** 
   - **Tax Considerations:** If you're eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be better.
   - **Investment Flexibility:** IRAs often offer a wider range of investment choices compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** 
   - **Balanced Approach:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can use taxable accounts for long-term investments. Focus on index funds or ETFs to minimize tax implications.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Utilize tax-loss harvesting and be mindful of capital gains.

### Allocation Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund First:** Ensure you have enough liquid savings before investing.
- **Diversification:** Aim for a balanced portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risks.
- **Re-evaluate Regularly:** Your financial situation and goals may change, so adjust your allocations as necessary.
