The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to help you determine an effective distribution strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), make sure to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this match. This is often considered "free money" and is a great place to start.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income in the current year. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met. Determine if a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA is more beneficial for your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes but can provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices. 

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investment choices in each account type align with your overall risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals. An effective strategy could involve a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets spread out among your accounts to ensure growth and manage risk.

4. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the contribution limits are as follows:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older)
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older)
   - Taxable accounts: no limits, but be mindful of tax implications when trading.

5. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Consider your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Typically, you may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing. However, this can depend on your tax situation at that time. 

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investment distribution periodically and rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about how to allocate your funds effectively, consider consulting with a financial advisor. They can help you create a tailored strategy based on your specific financial circumstances.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your unique financial situation, so itâ€™s important to assess all factors involved in your decision-making process.
