It's essential to consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax implications, and time horizon when distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide on the best distribution strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and should be a priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The choice between the two will depend on your current tax situation and expected tax situation in retirement. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

3. **Continue Funding Your 401(k)**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Additional Investments**: Once you've maximized contributions to your retirement accounts, consider putting extra funds into a taxable investment account. This account offers more flexibility, as you can withdraw funds without penalties, but remember that you’ll be subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider the Investment Strategy**: Decide on the allocation of your investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.) based on the account type. For tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you might want to hold investments with higher growth potential (like stocks), since withdrawals will be taxed later. In taxable accounts, consider holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) or investments with lower expected returns.

6. **Be Aware of Withdrawal Rules**: Remember that there are age restrictions and penalties associated with withdrawing funds from 401(k) and IRAs before retirement age (59½). Therefore, keeping some cash or liquid investments in taxable accounts for short-term needs is crucial.

7. **Revisit Your Strategy Regularly**: Your financial circumstances can change, so it's essential to review and adjust your strategy periodically based on life events (like marriage, children, or career changes) and market conditions.

It may be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your approach based on your unique financial situation and goals.
