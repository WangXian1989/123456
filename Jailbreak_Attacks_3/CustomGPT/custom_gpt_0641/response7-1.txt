Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) with matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. It’s essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions to your 401(k) if you are in a higher tax bracket since contributions are made pre-tax and can reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - Contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) can offer additional tax advantages. A Traditional IRA may offer tax-deductible contributions depending on your income, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA (income limits apply), consider contributing after securing any employer match in your 401(k), as this may provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Taxable investment accounts provide flexibility and access to your funds anytime without penalties. They may be a good option if you foresee needing access to your investments before retirement.
   - Use these accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or ETFs, which tend to have lower capital gains distributions.
   - Be mindful of tax implications when investing in taxable accounts and consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting to minimize tax liabilities.

**Overall Strategy**:
- Start with getting the full employer match in your 401(k).
- Max out your IRA contributions if possible.
- Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts.
- Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a specific strategy based on your individual circumstances.

**Investment Profile**:
- Risk Tolerance: Low, moderate, high?
- Time Horizon: Short-term or long-term goals?
- Financial Goals: Retirement, buying a home, education funding?

These factors will guide the allocation within and between these accounts.
