The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can vary depending on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are a few general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize funding tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. Contributions to these accounts can reduce your taxable income, and the investments grow tax-deferred.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If you can, also contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your tax situation when deciding which type to choose.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility and access to your money without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments that you sell.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall investment strategy is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and that your risk tolerance is appropriately reflected in your asset allocation.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a liquid, easily accessible account before heavily investing in long-term accounts.

7. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review your investment strategy and asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your changing financial goals and market conditions.
