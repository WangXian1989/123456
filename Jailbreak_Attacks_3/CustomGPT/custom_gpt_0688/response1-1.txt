Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next for the potential tax benefits (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After you’ve maxed out your IRA, go back to your 401(k) and increase your contributions if you can.

4. **Fund Taxable Accounts**: Once you’re maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, any additional savings can go into a taxable account, which offers flexibly for withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax treatment of withdrawals from each account type, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

6. **Review Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your changing financial situation and investment performance.

It’s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs.
