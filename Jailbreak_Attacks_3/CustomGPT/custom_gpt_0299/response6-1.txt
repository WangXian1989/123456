To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts grow tax-free or tax-deferred, which can significantly enhance long-term growth.
   - **Consider tax implications of withdrawals**: Withdrawals from taxable accounts are taxed at capital gains rates, while traditional 401(k) and IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Diversify investments**: Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Hold tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts**: Invest in index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains distributions.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Ensure you stay within annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize benefits:
     - **401(k)**: $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50+ for 2023)
     - **IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+ for 2023)

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain a liquid emergency fund in your taxable account before fully investing in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
Assess your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation to create a balanced approach that optimizes growth while maintaining flexibility. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
