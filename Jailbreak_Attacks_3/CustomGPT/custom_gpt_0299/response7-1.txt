The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute the maximum to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation.

2. **Invest for Growth**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth investments, such as stocks or equity mutual funds, since these accounts grow tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Any additional funds can be allocated to taxable accounts. Consider using these for short-term goals, as they provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize traditional accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) for tax deferral. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider Roth options.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Keep track of asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level across all accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial planner who can help assess your specific situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of income
- **IRA**: 10% of income
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remainder of savings

Ultimately, tailor your approach to fit your financial situation, goals, and preferences.
