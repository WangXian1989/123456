Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several key strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. Aim for the maximum annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. 

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate income (like bonds) to minimize tax burdens if youâ€™re in a higher bracket. 

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts to balance risk.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review and adjust your portfolio allocation regularly, considering market performance and your financial goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement to optimize tax efficiency, withdrawing from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help tailor a strategy suited to your financial situation.

By following these strategies, you can effectively manage your investments and optimize your portfolio.
