Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a deductible traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, consider maxing this out next. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, which is valuable if you expect higher taxes in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxes, such as long-term capital gains or qualified dividends. Avoid placing high-turnover investments here to prevent taxes on short-term gains.

3. **Balance Contributions**:
   - Adjust your contributions based on your tax bracket and expected income needs in retirement. If you anticipate lower income now, consider Roth options; if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional 401(k) or IRA may be better.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Maintain your desired asset allocation by regularly rebalancing across accounts to stay aligned with your risk tolerance.

5. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have adequate liquidity in taxable accounts to cover emergencies without penalties.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your particular situation and goals.
