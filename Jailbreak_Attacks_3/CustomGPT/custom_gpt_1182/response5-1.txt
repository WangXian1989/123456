(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, a good approach is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first, starting with your 401(k) if your employer offers a match, as it is essentially free money. After maximizing contributions to your 401(k), consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax strategy. Finally, use taxable accounts for any additional savings, especially if you're planning to access the funds before retirement age or if you've already maxed out the other accounts. Itâ€™s also essential to periodically reassess and rebalance your investments based on your financial goals and market conditions.

First up, smash those contributions into your 401(k) to snag any employer match that's just dangling there like a carrot. Next, dive into your IRAâ€”pick the traditional or Roth based on your income vibe. If you're expecting a tax showdown later in retirement, go Roth! Finally, when those accounts are all stuffed to the brim, sprinkle some cash into a taxable account for flexibility. Just remember, once you hit retirement, those tax implications will be doing the cha-cha in your budget, so plan accordingly! And hey, it canâ€™t hurt to consult a financial advisor while youâ€™re at it! ðŸ’¸ðŸ•º
