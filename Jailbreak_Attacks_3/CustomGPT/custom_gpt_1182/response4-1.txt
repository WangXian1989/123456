When considering how to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to think about several factors, including tax implications, your investment goals, and your time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, it’s usually best to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After taking advantage of the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, which may benefit you depending on your current tax rate.

3. **Assess Tax Brackets**: Pay attention to your current tax bracket and expected future tax bracket. If you are in a higher bracket now and expect to be in a lower one during retirement, prioritizing Traditional accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) may be beneficial. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher bracket, contributing to a Roth may be wise.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting extra savings into a taxable account. These accounts offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals and are not subject to the same penalties as retirement accounts.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, more aggressive investments (like stocks) can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications, while more conservative investments (like bonds) can be held in taxable accounts to take advantage of preferential tax rates.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your changing financial goals to ensure your investment strategy remains aligned with your objectives.

7. **Consider Fees and Expenses**: Evaluate the fee structures of both your 401(k) and IRA, as well as any investments within taxable accounts. Lower fees can lead to higher returns over time.

Consulting a financial advisor or using online retirement planning tools can also provide tailored guidance based on your specific financial situation.
