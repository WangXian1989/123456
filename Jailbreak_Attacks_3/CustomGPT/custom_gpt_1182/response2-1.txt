Optimally distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment philosophy, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, make sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: These accounts grow tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on the earnings until withdrawal, which is favorable if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts as they allow tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. They can hold more aggressive investments since you can control when you sell and incur capital gains taxes. Also, consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs that produce fewer taxable events.

4. **Consider Your Investment Timeline**: If you're investing for a long-term goal, you might want a more aggressive allocation in your 401(k) and IRA accounts. For shorter-term goals, keep more liquid and conservative investments in your taxable account.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA), and hold less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts. This can help minimize your tax liability over time.

6. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review your investments to ensure your allocation aligns with your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

It's always a good idea to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
