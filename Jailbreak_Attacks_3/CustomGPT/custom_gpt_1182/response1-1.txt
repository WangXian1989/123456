To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, meaning they reduce your taxable income. However, you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs function similarly to 401(k)s in terms of tax benefits. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals, but contributions are made with after-tax money.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Any gains are subject to capital gains taxes, but you have flexibility in withdrawal since there are no age penalties.

2. **Investment Goals**: Determine your short-term vs. long-term goals. If youâ€™re saving for retirement, a 401(k) or IRA might be best. If you need access to funds sooner, taxable accounts are more accessible.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type and prioritize contributions to accounts that offer employer matching, such as with a 401(k).

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified across different asset classes and account types to balance risk and returns.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, funds in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) should be tapped last to maximize tax efficiency.

A common strategy is to:
- Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially if there's an employer match.
- Contribute to an IRA, focusing on a Roth if you qualify and tax-free withdrawals are appealing.
- Use taxable accounts for any additional savings or investments that offer liquidity.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your unique financial situation.
