Distributing your money among various account types—401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts—depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out contributions in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) since they can provide tax benefits either on the upfront contributions (traditional) or on withdrawals (Roth).

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings in a liquid form (like a savings account) before overloading on investments, as this is crucial for financial security.

4. **Diversification**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on risk tolerance. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider putting additional savings into taxable accounts. These are more flexible but come with different tax implications, particularly on capital gains.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about your withdrawal strategy for retirement. Depending on your situation, it might make sense to draw from one account first over another to minimize taxes over time.

7. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your accounts to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Professional**: It can be wise to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your individual circumstances.

Be sure to evaluate your specific situation and adjust these recommendations accordingly!
