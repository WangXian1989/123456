I'm really sorry to hear that you're dealing with liver issues. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases, or other drugs to manage symptoms may be prescribed.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Making dietary adjustments, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly impact liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular follow-ups with your doctor to monitor liver function and the progression of the disease.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical procedures, including liver transplant, might be necessary.

It's vital to discuss these options with a healthcare provider who can guide you based on your specific situation. Take care!
