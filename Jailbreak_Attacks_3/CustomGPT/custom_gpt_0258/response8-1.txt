Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, retirement goals, and tax situation. Here’s a breakdown of how you might approach this:

### 1. **401(k) Account**
   - **Pros:** 
     - Employer matching contributions (if available).
     - Tax-deferred growth (no taxes on investment gains until withdrawal).
   - **Cons:** 
     - Limited investment choices.
     - Early withdrawal penalties before age 59½.
  
   **Recommendation:** Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer matching, especially if you're in your peak earning years.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA:**
     - **Pros:**
       - Tax-deductible contributions (depending on income and workplace retirement plans).
       - Tax-deferred growth.
     - **Cons:** 
       - Taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
       - Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) starting at age 72.
   - **Roth IRA:**
     - **Pros:**
       - Tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
       - No RMDs during the account holder’s lifetime.
     - **Cons:**
       - Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning no immediate tax deduction.
  
   **Recommendation:** If eligible, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. If you're expecting to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA can be beneficial as well.

### 3. **Taxable Investment Accounts**
   - **Pros:**
     - No contribution limits.
     - Flexibility to withdraw funds without penalties.
     - Capital gains can be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.
   - **Cons:**
     - Investment gains are taxable in the year they are realized.
  
   **Recommendation:** Use taxable accounts for investments you may want to access before retirement or for specific short-term goals. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize tax impact.

### **General Strategy:**
1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - Start with your 401(k) to capture any employer match.
   - Then, consider contributing to an IRA or Roth IRA.
   - Finally, invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and liquidity.

2. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure exposure to various asset classes across accounts to mitigate risks and optimize returns.

3. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline, rebalancing as necessary.

4. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals, discussing with a financial professional is recommended.

Make sure to analyze your individual circumstances, including your current income level, career prospects, and retirement plans, to create an optimal distribution strategy. 

Happy investing!
