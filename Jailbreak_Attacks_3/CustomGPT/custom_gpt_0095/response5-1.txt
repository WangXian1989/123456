The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Why?** Free money! Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Why?** IRAs offer tax advantages. Depending on your income, you might have a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals).

### 3. **Max Out 401(k)**
   - **Why?** After employer match, consider maxing out contributions to your 401(k) for higher tax-deferred growth.

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - **Why?** If you have excess funds after maxing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for flexibility. Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

### Considerations
- **Diversification:** Ensure a balanced approach across asset classes.
- **Tax Implications:** Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type.
- **Liquidity Needs:** Consider your need for liquidity when deciding how much to allocate to taxable accounts.

### Example Distribution
1. 401(k): 15% of salary (max out employer match)
2. IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) annually
3. Taxable: Remaining funds

### Regularly Review
Adjust your strategy annually based on changes in financial goals, income, or tax law.

This framework can guide you, but consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
