Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Use this account for higher-income periods since contributions reduce taxable income.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Consider Roth IRA for Tax-Free Withdrawals:** If you expect your income to increase, consider a Roth IRA, where contributions are made after tax but grow tax-free.
   - **Traditional IRA for Tax Deductions:** Useful if you want tax deductions now, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits:** Keep track of the annual limits for both types of IRAs.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility and Accessibility:** Use for investments you may need to access before retirement age without penalties.
   - **Long-Term Capital Gains:** Hold investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.
   - **Diversified Investments:** This can include stocks, bonds, or other investment vehicles that align with your goals.

### **General Strategy:**
1. **Emergency Fund First:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a savings account.
2. **Debt Management:** Pay off high-interest debts before investing aggressively.
3. **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk.
4. **Review Regularly:** Adjust your allocation based on changing life circumstances, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals.
