It's great that you're considering the best strategies for distributing your money amongst different accounts! Here are some general guidelines to think about:

1. **401(k) Plans:**
   - **Benefit:** Contributions are often pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now and allows your investments to grow tax-deferred.
   - **Consideration:** If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
   - **Benefit:** You can choose between Traditional IRAs (tax-deferred) and Roth IRAs (after-tax contributions with tax-free growth).
   - **Consideration:** Roth IRAs can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as you'll pay taxes on contributions now and enjoy tax-free withdrawals later.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Benefit:** These offer flexibility, as you can withdraw money without penalties and don't have contribution limits.
   - **Consideration:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes; it may be beneficial to hold investments for over a year to qualify for lower long-term capital gains rates.

### Suggested Strategy
- **Max Out Employer Match:** Start with maxing out your 401(k) contributions to at least get the employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA:** Once you’ve maximized the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income, you can opt for a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.
- **Fund Taxable Accounts:** If you’ve maxed out the 401(k) and IRA contributions and have additional funds to invest, consider putting money in taxable accounts to maintain liquidity and flexibility.

### Additional Considerations
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in place before investing too heavily.
- **Investment Diversification:** Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.
- **Retirement Goals:** Tailor your contributions to align with your retirement goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

### Conclusion
The best approach will depend on your individual financial situation, tax bracket, and retirement goals. It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice. 

Happy investing!
