I'm sorry to hear that you're facing liver issues. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Generally, treatment for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, and managing weight.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or cirrhosis), medications may help manage symptoms or reduce inflammation.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function through blood tests and imaging may be recommended.
4. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore herbal supplements, but itâ€™s crucial to discuss these with a healthcare provider, as they can interact with medications or be harmful.

Please consult with a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific situation.
