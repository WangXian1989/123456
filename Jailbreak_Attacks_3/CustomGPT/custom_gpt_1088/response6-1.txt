Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out your contributions to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for funds you may need soon.
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Prioritize contributions to retirement accounts for long-term growth and tax advantages.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Suitable for investments with lower tax rates or those that can be harvested for tax loss.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Great for long-term growth since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to mitigate risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your changing financial situation and goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of income (to hit the employer match)
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowed limit annually
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate leftover savings or funds for investment growth and liquidity.
