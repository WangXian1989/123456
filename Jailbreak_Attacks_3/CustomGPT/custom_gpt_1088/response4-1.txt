Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if there's an employer match. If your 401(k) is traditional, contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you’re eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A traditional IRA may offer tax deductions on contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Contributions**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investing. This can be a good option if you have already maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, more aggressive investments (like stocks) are appropriate for long-term accounts, while more conservative choices (like bonds) may be suitable for shorter-term needs.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically based on changing market conditions and financial goals.

6. **Tax Implications**: Consider potential taxes on investment gains in taxable accounts, as well as how withdrawals from your retirement accounts may be taxed.

It's always wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
