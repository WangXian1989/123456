Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (if qualified) are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends are taxable in the year they are received.

3. **Consider Liquidity Needs**:
   - If you may need access to your money before retirement, prioritize savings in taxable accounts since retirement accounts can impose penalties for early withdrawals.

4. **Assess Investment Options**:
   - Look at the investment choices within each account. If your 401(k) has high fees or limited options, consider focusing on IRAs or taxable accounts for investment diversity.

5. **Long-Term Growth**:
   - Generally, invest for growth in tax-advantaged accounts to reap the benefits of compound growth without immediate tax consequences. Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments like bonds that generate regular income subject to taxes.

6. **Rebalance and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market performance, and retirement goals.

It’s always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
