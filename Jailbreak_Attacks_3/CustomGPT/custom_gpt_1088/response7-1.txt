Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are general guidelines to help:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often tax-deferred, helping you to reduce your taxable income now.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred like 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These don’t have tax advantages, but you can access funds at any time without penalties.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth contributions may be beneficial.
   - If you're currently in a lower tax bracket, consider contributing to traditional accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Maintain a diverse portfolio across accounts. This includes stocks, bonds, and other investments suited to your risk tolerance.
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on the account type and your overall investment strategy.

### 5. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - Consider your withdrawal strategy for retirement. Taxable accounts may offer more flexibility without penalties for early withdrawal.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from your retirement accounts, typically covering 3-6 months of expenses.

### 7. **Investment Horizon**
   - Younger investors might favor aggressive growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement may prioritize capital preservation.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out employer match, then contribute up to the limit.
- **IRA:** Consider maxing out a Roth if eligible or a traditional IRA for tax benefits.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional investments once retirement accounts are maximized, especially if you need flexibility.

### Regular Review
- Periodically reevaluate your allocation as your financial situation and markets change, adapting your strategy for life transitions or market conditions.
