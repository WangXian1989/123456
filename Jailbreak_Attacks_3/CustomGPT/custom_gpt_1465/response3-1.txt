Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the maximum limit, especially if your employer matches contributions. 
   - **IRA**: If you can, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA (prioritize based on your tax situation).

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term needs or investments that generate capital gains or tax-efficient investments (like index funds).

4. **Balance Risk and Growth**: 
   - Consider your risk tolerance when allocating investments within these accounts. Generally, retirement accounts can be more aggressive since they have a longer time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your asset allocation annually to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances by getting professional advice.

This strategy can help you grow your wealth while considering tax implications and retirement readiness.
