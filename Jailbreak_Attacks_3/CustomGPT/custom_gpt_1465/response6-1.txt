Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Tax-deferred growth until withdrawals.
- **IRA**: Individual account that allows for tax-deferred or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible, accessible funds, but subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. Contribution Priorities
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full company match.
- **Fund IRAs**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. Investment Strategy
- **Long-Term Growth**: Favor stocks in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term tax deferral.
- **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Use taxable accounts for tax-efficient investments, like index funds or municipal bonds.

### 4. Monitor and Rebalance
- Regularly review your asset allocation across these accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach is key. Prioritize employer matches and tax-advantaged accounts, and strategically use taxable accounts for flexibility.
