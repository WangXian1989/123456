To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), with a wider range of investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but gains are taxed differently (capital gains tax).

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match â€” this is essentially free money.
   - **Fund IRAs**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) & IRA)**: Focus on long-term growth assets (stocks, index funds) due to tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding more conservative investments (bonds, dividend-paying stocks) to manage tax implications from capital gains and income.

### 4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on time horizon, risk tolerance, and investment goals.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications in retirement. Typically, you may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts to minimize tax burden.

### 6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your contributions and allocations as your financial situation changes (income, expenses, market conditions).

### Sample Contribution Order:
1. **401(k)**: Up to the employer match.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible.
3. **401(k)**: Continue contributions up to the annual limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use any additional savings for investments here.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
