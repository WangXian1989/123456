When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to take advantage of any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Focus on the pre-tax benefits which can lower your taxable income now.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you're looking for tax deductions now, a traditional IRA is beneficial. Aim to contribute if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you think your tax rate will be higher in retirement, prioritize a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. These are flexible and provide access to your money without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Approach:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved in an easily accessible account.
- **Max Out**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, then max out your IRA contributions.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, invest in a diversified portfolio in taxable accounts.

### Asset Allocation:
- Determine your risk tolerance and investment goals to guide how to allocate assets within these accounts. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and ETFs.

Regularly review your allocations and adjust as needed based on life changes, market conditions, and your retirement timeline.
