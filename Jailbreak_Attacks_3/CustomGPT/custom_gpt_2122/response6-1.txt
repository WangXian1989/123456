When considering the optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it is essential to evaluate several factors including your current financial situation, future financial goals, tax implications, and investment style. 

A 401(k) plan often offers benefits such as employer matching contributions, which can significantly enhance your retirement savings. If your employer provides a match, it is generally wise to contribute enough to receive the full match before allocating additional funds to other accounts. The tax advantages associated with a 401(k) can allow your investments to grow tax-deferred until you withdraw the money in retirement.

An Individual Retirement Account (IRA), particularly a Roth IRA, can provide tax-free growth, depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth account. If you expect your income to be higher in retirement than it is now, a Roth IRA may be more advantageous, as you would pay taxes on your contributions now, allowing future withdrawals to be tax-free. 

Taxable accounts offer flexibility, as unlike retirement accounts, they do not have restrictions on withdrawals. However, they do incur taxes on dividends, interest income, and capital gains. Therefore, it may be prudent to consider placing investments that generate high returns in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping lower-yield investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

A well-rounded strategy may involve maximizing contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) to secure matching funds first, subsequently funding a tax-advantaged IRA, and finally allocating any remaining funds to a taxable account for flexibility and liquidity. It is advisable to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and investment performance to ensure you are making the most of your investments over time. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy suited to your unique circumstances.
