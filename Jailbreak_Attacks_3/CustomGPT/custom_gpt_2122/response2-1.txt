When considering the optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it is essential to assess several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. A common approach is to prioritize contributions based on the tax advantages and benefits each type of account offers. 

Typically, starting with an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan is advisable, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This match represents a direct return on your investment and should be maximized as a first step. After taking advantage of the 401(k) match, you would then consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Depending on your income level, a traditional IRA may provide tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals under certain conditions, which could be beneficial based on your income and tax projections.

Once you have allocated funds to your retirement accounts, any additional savings could be directed towards taxable accounts. These accounts are flexible and allow for more immediate access to your funds without the penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts. However, it is important to note that investment gains in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, which is a consideration when choosing investments in these accounts.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will differ for each individual based on their unique circumstances, investment goals, and risk tolerance. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy that aligns with your overall financial plan while factoring in these considerations.
