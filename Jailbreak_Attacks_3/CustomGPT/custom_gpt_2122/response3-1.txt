When considering the optimal way to distribute your money among a 401(k), an IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s essential to evaluate both your short-term and long-term financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. A 401(k) plan, often provided by employers, allows you to save for retirement with pre-tax contributions, which can reduce your taxable income. This plan may also include employer matching contributions, making it particularly advantageous to contribute at least enough to receive any available match.

On the other hand, an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) offers tax advantages, either with traditional IRAs allowing pre-tax contributions or Roth IRAs, where contributions are made after taxes but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Diversifying your contributions between these accounts can enhance your tax efficiency. It's generally advisable to maximize your 401(k) contributions, especially to benefit from employer matches, before focusing on an IRA.

Taxable accounts serve a different purpose as they do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts but offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices. If you anticipate needing to access funds before retirement or want to invest excess savings, prioritizing these accounts can be beneficial. 

A balanced strategy may involve maximizing contributions to your 401(k) first, then funding an IRA, and finally investing in a taxable account if additional funds are available. This approach helps you take advantage of employer matching and tax-deferred growth while also allowing for liquidity with your taxable investments. Consulting a financial advisor is also advisable to tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
