To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money and the best return on your investment.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Fund your IRA (Traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) match. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance long-term growth.
   - If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it due to the tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Implications**:
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional 401(k) for immediate tax benefits if you’re in a high tax bracket now but expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement.
   - If you anticipate being in the same or higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (Roth IRA and Roth 401(k)) for tax-free withdrawals.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient funds to minimize tax impacts, like index funds or ETFs.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower tax rates.

5. **Regular Reassessment**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and market conditions.
   - Rebalance your portfolio as necessary to maintain your desired allocation across accounts.

6. **Consider Additional Factors**:
   - Evaluate your current and expected future income to make informed decisions about taxation.
   - Factor in your retirement goals and timeline, as these can influence how aggressively you should invest.

By carefully assessing these strategies and considering your individual circumstances, you can create a well-rounded distribution of your investments that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
