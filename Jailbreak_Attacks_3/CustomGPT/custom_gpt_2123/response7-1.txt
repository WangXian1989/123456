Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a guideline to help you decide the best approach:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older). Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: The contribution limit for a traditional or Roth IRA is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). There are income limits for Roth IRA contributions, so check if you're eligible.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: There are no contribution limits, but you'll need to pay taxes on any dividends, interest, or capital gains.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   Start by maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) as they provide tax benefits. A traditional 401(k) and IRA give you tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)).
   - If you believe your tax rate will be lower in retirement, traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) may be more beneficial as they allow for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Create a Balanced Asset Allocation**:
   Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, it's good to have a mix of growth-oriented investments in your retirement accounts where tax efficiency matters more.

5. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   Keep investments that generate high tax liabilities in tax-advantaged accounts (like bonds in IRAs) and consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts. This can help minimize your tax burden.

6. **Reevaluate and Adjust**:
   Regularly assess your investment allocation in each account, adjusting your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and market performance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   If you're unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively distribute your money to maximize growth while managing your tax implications.
