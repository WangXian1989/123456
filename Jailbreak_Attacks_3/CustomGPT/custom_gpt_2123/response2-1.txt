Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider for optimal distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Understand the Types of Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are usually pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. Distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. Consider this account if you want immediate tax benefits.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions for contributions (like the 401(k)), but withdrawals are taxed. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement if conditions are met. Choose based on your expected future tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts donâ€™t have the tax advantages of retirement accounts but provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. They are also subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Prioritize Based on Goals**:
   - For long-term retirement savings, prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - If you're close to retirement, consider moving funds from taxable accounts to retirement accounts if timely.
   - Maintain an emergency fund and short-term savings in your taxable account for liquidity.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk and optimize returns. Each account type can hold numerous asset classes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as needed, considering the performance of investments and any changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your individual circumstances, helping you develop a strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals.

In conclusion, a balanced approach often involves maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first and utilizing taxable accounts for additional investments and liquidity. Tailor your strategy depending on your specific financial situation, goals, and tax considerations.
