When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match since it’s essentially “free” money. After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, as they also offer tax advantages.

2. **Consider Account Types for Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, meaning you won’t pay taxes on this money until you withdraw it, typically in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. Consider maximizing this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Since they don’t offer tax advantages, consider using them for short-term savings or investments that generate capital gains or qualify for lower tax rates, like long-term investments.

3. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your time horizon for each account type. If you’re saving for retirement, a mix of tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) might be preferable. For shorter-term goals, prioritize your taxable accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to reduce risk. The allocation may differ depending on whether the account is tax-advantaged or taxable.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As markets fluctuate, ensure your asset allocation reflects your risk tolerance and investment goals. This might involve shifting funds between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.

6. **Consider Fees and Expenses**: Different accounts and investment options can have varying fees. Be mindful of these, as high fees can eat into your returns over time.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax laws and financial planning, consider seeking advice tailored to your specific situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your investment accounts.
