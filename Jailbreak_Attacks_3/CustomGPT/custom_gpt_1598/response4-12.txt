I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes, medication, or more advanced therapies, depending on the severity and cause of the issue.
