When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match—it's essentially free money!
   - **Tax Deferral**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, and investments can grow tax-deferred.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose between a Roth IRA (tax-free growth) or a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions). Roths are great if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and make sure you’re maxing out if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow you to access funds anytime without penalties, making them useful for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they’re taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Tax Considerations**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts and income-generating assets in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

Always consult a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation!
