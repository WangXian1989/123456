I'm not a doctor, but it's really important to consult a healthcare professional for any liver issues you may have. They can provide personalized advice and treatment options based on your specific condition. Common treatments can include medication, lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, and sometimes surgical options, depending on the severity of the problem. Always best to get a professional's opinion!
