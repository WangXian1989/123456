Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match before focusing on other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages. Roth IRAs can offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which may be beneficial depending on your future tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for savings beyond tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts can be useful for short-term savings and offer flexibility, though youâ€™ll want to be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep an eye on how your investments will be taxed. Generally, you should place your investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and those with capital gains potential (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws. Rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired risk level.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your individual circumstances.
