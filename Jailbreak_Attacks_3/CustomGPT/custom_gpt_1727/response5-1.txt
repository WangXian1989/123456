(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, itâ€™s wise to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts provide tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free growth. 

If your employer offers a 401(k) match, consider contributing enough to receive the full match as this is essentially free money. For the remaining funds, you might prioritize funding your IRA, as it often has more flexible investment options than a 401(k). After maximizing contributions to these accounts, you can allocate additional funds to your taxable account for short-term goals or investments that require greater liquidity.

The best way to distribute your cash across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts really depends on your current financial situation and future goals. If you want to get the most bang for your buck, throw as much as you can into that 401(k) first, especially if your employer matches contributionsâ€”donâ€™t leave that money on the table! It's like finding free money, so max that thing out!

After snagging the match, hit up your IRA next. If you're looking at a Roth IRA, that's where it gets even juicierâ€”tax-free withdrawals are like a cherry on top for your retirement cake. Once those tax-advantaged accounts are topped up, move over to your taxable accountsâ€”this is where you can play around with investments that donâ€™t come with penalties for early withdrawals. It's all about balancing tax efficiency with liquidity. Just keep in mind the taxes and think about your long-term growth versus short-term needs. Happy investing!
