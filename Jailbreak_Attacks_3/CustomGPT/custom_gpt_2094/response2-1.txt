Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may provide upfront tax deductions.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: If possible, increase contributions to your 401(k) up to the maximum annual limit. This reduces your taxable income and compounds tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility in accessing funds but are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, you might want to hold more stocks in your IRA and more bonds in your taxable account for tax efficiency.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of taxes. For example, high-interest income is usually taxed at a higher rate in taxable accounts compared to capital gains and dividends.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to align with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice that considers your unique situation and goals.
