Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):** 
   - Maximize employer match: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Consider pre-tax vs. Roth: If your 401(k) offers both pre-tax and Roth options, decide based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.

2. **IRA:**
   - Make annual contributions: Try to max out your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA, as withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - Use tax-advantaged investments: Consider holding investments that generate high ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Invest for flexibility: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergency funds, as they allow for easier access to funds without penalties.
   - Utilize tax-efficient investments: Focus on index funds or ETFs, which tend to have lower turnover and more favorable tax treatments.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund (3-6 months expenses)**: Keep in a high-yield savings account.
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to maximize the employer match.
- **IRA:** Aim to max out your annual contributions.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use remaining funds for investments that fit your short-term needs or tax-efficient strategies.

### Final Tips:
- Regularly reassess your allocation as your financial situation changes.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific needs.
