Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**:
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your eligibility. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**:
   - Once youâ€™ve contributed to your IRA, focus on maxing out your 401(k) contributions. The contribution limits are generally higher than for IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds in taxable accounts. These can offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and allow for investments in a broader range of securities.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure you maintain a solid asset allocation across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment objectives. For example, you might choose stocks in a taxable account for potential long-term capital gains, while reserving bond investments for tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Monitor Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of taxes on capital gains, dividends, and interest. Consider your current tax bracket and how withdrawals from your 401(k) or IRA may affect your taxable income in retirement.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments to ensure your portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure how to proceed, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and effective distribution plan for your investments.
