When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Prioritize contributions to these accounts, especially if your employer offers a match. They provide tax advantages that can maximize growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments not conducive to tax-advantaged accounts, such as stocks held long-term to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Retirement**: Allocate a higher percentage to your 401(k) and IRA for retirement-focused investments.
   - **Short-term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for any funds needed in the near term, allowing more liquidity and flexibility.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as they have annual limits. Once those are maxed out, direct additional funds to taxable accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diverse your holdings across all accounts but consider putting higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts where gains can be shielded from taxes.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changing financial goals.

This strategy can provide a balanced approach to growth while optimizing tax implications.
