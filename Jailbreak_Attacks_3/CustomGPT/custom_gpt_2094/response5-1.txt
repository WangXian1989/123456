Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - If you're in a high tax bracket, prioritizing contributions can provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **IRA**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals will be tax-free.
   - A traditional IRA may be beneficial if you're looking for immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for additional savings once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out.
   - Consider investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Tips:
- **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
- **Rebalancing**: Periodically reassess your asset allocation based on performance and changing goals.
- **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how you'll withdraw from each account in retirement for tax efficiency.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
