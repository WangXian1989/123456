To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer match first. Contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money. Focus on tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: If eligible, prioritize contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer immediate tax deductions, consider a traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or after maxing out retirement accounts. Focus on investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize employer match in 401(k)**.
- **Contribute to IRAs** (traditional or Roth based on your tax situation).
- **Invest additional funds in taxable accounts** for flexibility.

### Considerations:
- **Tax implications**: Understand tax benefits of each account type.
- **Investment goals**: Align your strategy with your time horizon and risk tolerance.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced investment portfolio across all accounts.
