To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Consider whether a traditional or Roth option best suits your tax situation.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates. This can include stocks or index funds.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk. Consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline when choosing assets.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Think about how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Tax-efficient withdrawal strategies can minimize taxes over the long term.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice that considers your financial situation, goals, and tax implications.

This balanced approach helps optimize growth while managing risk and taxes effectively.
