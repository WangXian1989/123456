To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Fund Your 401(k)**: If you haven't maxed out your 401(k) contributions (the annual limit is $22,500 for 2023), continue to contribute to it for tax benefits and potential growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This is suitable for short- to mid-term goals or to maintain liquidity.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments within these accounts according to your risk tolerance and timeline. For instance, consider placing higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and lower-risk investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of placing tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to reduce capital gains taxes.

7. **Adjust as Needed**: Periodically review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
