Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is free money and a great return on investment.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have the match, prioritize maxing this out. Consider traditional contributions for pre-tax benefits or Roth contributions for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA next. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.

3. **Taxable Accounts Last**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These accounts are more flexible but may have tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across these accounts based on risk tolerance, goals, and time horizon. Generally, stocks may be favored in tax-advantaged accounts due to their potential for higher growth.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on performance, fees, and changes in your financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.
