It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Incorporate a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while avoiding alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Weight Management**: Achieving a healthy weight can reduce strain on the liver.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to reduce symptoms or manage underlying issues.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests and imaging may be needed to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**:
   - Minimize exposure to harmful substances, including alcohol and certain medications.

5. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some may explore supplements or herbal remedies, but it's essential to consult a doctor before starting any new treatment.

6. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases or for specific conditions (like tumors), surgical options may be necessary.

Always discuss your options with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
