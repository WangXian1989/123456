To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer tax advantages. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and for an IRA, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

2. **Employer Match**: Prioritize your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

3. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for high-growth investments (like stocks), which can be taxed at a higher rate in taxable accounts.
   - Call derivatives or bonds in taxable accounts as they may be taxed at a lower rate or could benefit from tax-exempt status.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance and investment goals, determine how to allocate assets across accounts. For example:
   - **401(k)**: Higher-risk assets
   - **IRA**: Mix of growth and stable investments
   - **Taxable Account**: More stable investments for liquidity

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation as necessary, considering market conditions and your financial goals.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement. Consider the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type, aiming to minimize tax burdens over time.
