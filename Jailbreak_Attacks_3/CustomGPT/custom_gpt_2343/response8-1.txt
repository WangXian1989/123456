Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing growth, tax efficiency, and your financial goals. Here are some strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions if possible. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.

2. **Consider Income Tax Impact**:
   - Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), where they wonâ€™t be taxed annually.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate little or no income, like growth stocks.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts to manage risk.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals smartly based on your tax bracket during retirement. Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow.
