Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA depending on your tax situation and eligibility. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
   - Taxable accounts are taxed on capital gains and dividends, so focus on investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds or tax-efficient funds) in these accounts. 
   - Hold bonds or high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity for emergencies, ideally through a savings account separate from investments.

4. **Long-Term Growth vs. Short-Term Needs**: 
   - Allocate more aggressive growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts due to their long-term potential. 
   - Place more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts if you need access to them sooner.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocation based on changes in the market or your personal situation.
