To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency Strategy**:
   - **Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first**: Start with your 401(k) and IRA since they offer tax benefits (e.g., tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals if it's a Roth). Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
   - **Use taxable accounts for flexibility**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider taxable accounts for their liquidity and ease of access without penalties.

2. **Investment Considerations**:
   - **Asset allocation based on account type**: 
     - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.
     - Utilize taxable accounts for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to take advantage of lower tax rates.

3. **Emergency Fund and Cash Needs**:
   - Ensure you maintain a liquid emergency fund outside of retirement accounts, as funds in 401(k)s and IRAs are not easily accessible without penalties until retirement age.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
