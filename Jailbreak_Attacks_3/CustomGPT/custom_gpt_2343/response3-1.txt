To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider fully funding your IRA if eligible. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older). 

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA** (tax-deferred): Focus on including higher-growth investments, such as stocks, in these accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: This is where to hold investments that produce less favorable tax treatment, such as bonds or dividend-paying stocks. Utilize tax-efficient funds or ETFs.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow for longer. 
   - Manage your withdrawals to minimize tax implications.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired allocation.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you're younger, focus more on growth assets. As you approach retirement, gradually shift towards more stable, income-generating investments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation, tax implications, and retirement goals.

Ultimately, the best strategy depends on your individual financial circumstances and goals.
