To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

### 1. **Understand the Account Types**  
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching; traditional or Roth options.
   - **IRA**: Traditional offers tax-deferred growth; Roth provides tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible, but capital gains taxes apply.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**  
   - **Long-term growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-term needs**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 3. **Maximize Contributions**  
   - Fully utilize employer match in your 401(k).
   - Contribute to your IRA, prioritizing the type that aligns with your tax situation.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency**  
   - Place high-growth investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Hold income-generating investments (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts where possible.

### 5. **Diversification**  
   - Diversify investments within each account to manage risk.
   - Consider asset allocation strategies based on your risk tolerance.

### 6. **Review and Adjust**  
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on performance and life changes.
   - Rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Sample Distribution Strategy  
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to max out employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the annual limit.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

By balancing these accounts based on your personal financial situation, you can optimize growth while minimizing taxes. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
