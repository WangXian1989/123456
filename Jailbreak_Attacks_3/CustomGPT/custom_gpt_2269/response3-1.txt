### Best Strategies for Distributing Money Among 401(k), IRA, and Taxable Accounts

To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

#### 1. **Understanding Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored; often includes matching contributions; tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Individual retirement account; Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts not designated for retirement; subject to capital gains tax but offer flexibility in access.

#### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing match, consider funding your IRA (traditional or Roth) depending on tax situation and retirement goals.

#### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable vs. Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Ideally, place higher-interest-bearing investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or eliminate taxes.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like municipal bonds).

#### 4. **Consider Investment Growth Timelines**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Invest for growth (stocks) in retirement accounts. 
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more liquid, conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

#### 5. **Regularly Reevaluate**
   - **Adjust for Changes**: Revisit your investment strategy periodically based on changes in income, employment, and market conditions.
   - **Tax Law Changes**: Stay informed about changes in tax laws that may affect your strategy.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions to receive employer match.
- **Roth IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed if eligible.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds in accordance with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### Closing Thoughts
