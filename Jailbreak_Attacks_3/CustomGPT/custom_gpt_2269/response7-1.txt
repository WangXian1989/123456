To effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Assess Your Retirement Goals**
   - Determine your retirement timeline and financial goals.

### 2. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored; often has matching contributions and tax advantages.
   - **IRA**: Individual retirement account with tax benefits; Traditional IRAs have tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages; suitable for short-term goals but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first.
   - **Maximize IRA Contributions**: After the match, contribute to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth depending on your situation).
   - **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out your IRA, return to your 401(k) to maximize it if possible.

### 4. **Consider Asset Allocation**
   - Decide on a diversified investment strategy based on your risk tolerance across all accounts.

### 5. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments in your taxable accounts (e.g., index funds, ETFs) and allocate income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to keep your investment strategy aligned with your goals.
  
### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 50% of the total allocation (focus on maximizing employer match).
- **IRA**: 30% (max out contributions yearly).
- **Taxable Account**: 20% (for liquidity and non-retirement goals).
