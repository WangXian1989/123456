Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50+). Consider contributing up to the limit if you can afford it.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose a diversified mix of investments aligned with your risk tolerance.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Types of IRA**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions but taxed upon withdrawal) and a Roth IRA (contributions taxed, but tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if youâ€™re 50+). Consider maxing this out, especially with a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Invest in a Broader Selection**: IRAs often provide a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquid Assets**: Use these for short-term goals or as an emergency fund since they are more accessible.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxable events.
   - **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced approach between stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### Overall Strategy
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with employer match in your 401(k), then fund your IRA, and lastly, contribute to taxable accounts.
- **Tax Considerations**: Consider the tax implications of each account type and how withdrawals will impact your tax situation in retirement.
- **Regular Reviews**: Reassess your strategy annually based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: 30%
- **Taxable Account**: 20%
