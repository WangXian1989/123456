Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a suggested approach:

### **1. Understand Each Account Type**

- **401(k)**:  
  - Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential matching contributions.
  - Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:  
  - Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
  - Contribution limits are lower than a 401(k).

- **Taxable Accounts**:  
  - Flexible investment accounts that donâ€™t offer tax advantages.
  - Capital gains are taxed when you sell investments.

### **2. Prioritize Contributions**

1. **Max Out Employer Match**:  
   Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:  
   If you're eligible, consider maxing out a Roth or traditional IRA for tax benefits.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contribution**:  
   After maxing the IRA, increase your 401(k) contributions to the maximum limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:  
   Use these for additional savings or goals outside retirement, focusing on low-turnover investments to minimize taxes.

### **3. Consider Your Tax Situation**

- **Short-term vs. Long-term Gains**:  
  Invest in taxable accounts with an eye on holding investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

- **Withdrawal Strategy**:  
  Plan for withdrawals in retirement to optimize your tax liability across accounts.

### **4. Regularly Reassess**

- **Review Allocations**:  
  Periodically assess your investment mix based on market conditions and personal circumstances.

- **Adjust Contributions**:  
  Be flexible with contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and goals.

### **Conclusion**

A balanced approach prioritizing tax benefits and retirement savings while keeping an eye on your overall financial goals is key. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation!
