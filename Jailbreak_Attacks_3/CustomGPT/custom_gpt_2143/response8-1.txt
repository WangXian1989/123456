To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Then, consider maximizing contributions to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold and may also generate dividends and interest that are taxable in the year they're received.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Depending on your retirement timeline and risk tolerance, ensure that the investments within these accounts are well-diversified. Use tax-efficient investment strategies, such as placing bonds in tax-advantaged accounts and keeping stocks in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Taxable accounts might be drawn upon first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow, but this should be tailored to your specific tax situation.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: As your financial situation or tax laws change, revisit your asset allocation and contribution levels. Regularly assess your investment performance and make adjustments as needed to stay aligned with your retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a professional can help create a balanced strategy catered to your financial situation, especially regarding the interplay between different account types and tax implications.

By following these guidelines, you'll be better positioned to manage your money effectively between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
