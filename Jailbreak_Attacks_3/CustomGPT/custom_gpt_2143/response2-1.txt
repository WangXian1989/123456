Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your investment growth over time.

   - **401(k)**: If your employer has a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. Then, consider contributing more to reach the annual limit if you can afford it.
   
   - **Traditional or Roth IRA**: Depending on your income and tax bracket, consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. If you're eligible, a Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility but come with tax implications for capital gains and dividends.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall investment portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of the account type.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking advice from a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your individual circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can make informed decisions about distributing your money effectively.
