I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Treatment options may vary based on the specific liver condition you have. Some common treatment approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This can include adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight.
2. **Medications**: Your doctor may prescribe medications to help manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause of liver disease.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping track of liver function through regular check-ups and blood tests may be recommended.
4. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgical interventions may be necessary, such as a liver transplant.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice based on your situation.
