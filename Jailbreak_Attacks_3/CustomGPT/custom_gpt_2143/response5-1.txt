Generally, a good strategy is to maximize your employer's match in your 401(k) first, then consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can fund your taxable investment account as needed. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial circumstances.
