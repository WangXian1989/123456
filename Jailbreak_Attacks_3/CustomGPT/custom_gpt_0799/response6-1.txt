When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to maximize your returns and tax efficiency:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500, with an additional $1,000 catch-up for those aged 50 and older.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Focus on tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) for higher income years to lower your taxable income.
   - Use Roth IRA conversions in lower income years to gain tax-free growth later.

3. **Consider Investment Vehicles**:
   - For your **401(k)** and **IRA**, opt for a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - In your **taxable accounts**, consider investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly assess and adjust your asset allocation among accounts to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals. 

By strategically distributing your contributions across these accounts, you can enhance your overall investment growth and minimize taxes over time.
