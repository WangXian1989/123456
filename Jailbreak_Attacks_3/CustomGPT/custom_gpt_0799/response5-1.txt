(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income level, retirement goals, and tax situation. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially "free money." After maximizing any employer match, contributing to an IRA can be a good next step, especially if you are eligible for tax-deductible contributions. Taxable accounts can be beneficial for short-term investment goals or if you are looking for liquidity. It can also serve as a flexible investment vehicle if youâ€™ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts. A typical distribution might look like this:

1. Max out employer 401(k) match.
2. Contribute to IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).
3. Invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts, focusing on long-term investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

First off, if you've got a 401(k) match at work, grab that like itâ€™s the hottest ticket at a concert â€“ donâ€™t leave free money on the table! Once youâ€™ve claimed that sweet perk, think about a traditional or Roth IRA next. People overthink this a lot. If you want the tax deductions now, go traditional; if you want to pay taxes now for tax-free withdrawals later, then hello Roth! 

Beyond that, taxable accounts are like your investment wild cardâ€”use them for what youâ€™d like, but grab a beer and relax; just remember that youâ€™ll have to pay taxes on those gains as they come rolling in. A simple game plan? Max out that 401(k) match, dump some cash into that IRA, and anything left over? Pour it into your taxable accounts for a future investment party. Balance it based on your goalsâ€”long-term growth versus short-term needs, got it? Boom, balanced portfolio!
