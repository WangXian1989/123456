To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Tax Efficiency in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, such as index funds or long-term capital gains. This helps minimize tax liability.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Place high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Use tax-exempt or tax-advantaged investments (like municipal bonds) in your taxable accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in any account. This should cover 3 to 6 months of expenses.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

7. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Consider how long you plan to keep your money invested. Longer horizons may allow for more risk in tax-advantaged accounts.

8. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Overall, a balanced approach is often best, focusing on maximizing growth while minimizing taxes and ensuring liquidity for short-term needs.
