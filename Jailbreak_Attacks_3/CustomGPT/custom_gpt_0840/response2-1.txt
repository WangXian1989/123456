Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits:**
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth Accounts:**
     - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now; you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 3. **Emergency Savings First:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### 4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** These accounts are typically for long-term growth. Consider a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your age and risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These can be more flexible for short- to medium-term goals. Focus on investments that minimize capital gains taxes, such as index funds or ETFs.

### 5. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Favor tax-efficient investments (like index funds) and consider holding investments for over a year to qualify for lower long-term capital gains tax rates.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place higher-growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes until retirement.

### 6. **Regular Contributions:**
   - Set a schedule for regular contributions to all accounts in alignment with your cash flow and financial goals.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically reevaluate your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you're unsure, consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

By carefully considering these elements, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, optimizing for both growth and tax efficiency.
