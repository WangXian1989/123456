To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, max out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions — beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
  
### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high capital gains or dividends. Since you can access these funds without penalty, they provide liquidity and investment flexibility.
   - Consider holding more conservative or less tax-inefficient investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. Different accounts may house different asset types (stocks in tax-advantaged accounts, bonds in taxable accounts).
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset mix and risk tolerance.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy Planning:**
   - Think ahead about how you’ll withdraw from each account during retirement. Typically, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

By diversifying your investments and making the most of tax-advantaged accounts, you can maximize growth while managing your tax liabilities effectively. Always consider your specific financial situation and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
