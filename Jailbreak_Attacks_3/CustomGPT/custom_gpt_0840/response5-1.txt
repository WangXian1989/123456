Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions if possible, especially if you're in your peak earning years.
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds if available.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. A Traditional IRA may be better if you expect your tax rate to decrease.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual limits (e.g., $6,500 for individuals under 50 as of 2023).
   - **Diversification**: Use IRAs for a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for investments that are expected to generate capital gains or interest in the long term.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Favor tax-efficient investments, such as municipal bonds or index funds, to minimize the impact of taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a separate savings account.
- **Prioritize Growth**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and use taxable accounts for income-producing investments.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust allocations as market conditions change and as you approach retirement.
