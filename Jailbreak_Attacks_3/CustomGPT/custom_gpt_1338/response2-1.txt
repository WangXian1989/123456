When it comes to distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors should be considered, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA**: After the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Roth or Traditional) based on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) and increase your contributions up to the maximum limit if you can afford it.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you still have money left to invest, consider a taxable account for additional investments. This can provide more flexibility for withdrawals compared to retirement accounts but comes with different tax implications.

5. **Asset Allocation**: How you allocate your investments should also depend on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Think about diversification among stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your financial situation and adjust your contributions as needed based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

It's always good to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice that considers your unique financial situation and goals.
