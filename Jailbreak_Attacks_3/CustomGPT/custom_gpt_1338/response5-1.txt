(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Generally, it's advisable to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider focusing on your IRA, which often offers more investment options and tax advantages. Finally, taxable accounts can be a good place for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends that could be taxed at a lower rate.

When determining the specific allocation among these accounts, consider your overall retirement strategy and the tax implications of each account type. For personalized advice, it might be best to consult with a financial advisor who can take into account your unique situation.
