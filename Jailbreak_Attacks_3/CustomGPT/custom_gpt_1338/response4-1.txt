I'm glad you reached out for information on distributing your money among different investment accounts. However, please remember that my advice is based on general information and should not replace professional financial consultation.

That said, a balanced approach is often recommended:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. If you're under 50, you can contribute up to $22,500 (as of 2023). If you're 50 or older, you can contribute an extra $7,500 as catch-up contributions. Prioritize maxing out contributions if possible for tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, contributions are made with after-tax dollars but can grow tax-free. For 2023, the contribution limit is up to $6,500 or $7,500 if you're over 50. Choose based on your current tax situation and future expectations.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting any additional savings into a taxable account. This can provide flexibility as funds are not subject to early withdrawal penalties. Just be mindful of capital gains taxes when you sell assets for a profit.

A potential distribution strategy could be: prioritize employer matching in your 401(k), then max out your IRA, and finally, utilize any additional funds for taxable investments. Always review your personal financial situation, investment goals, and risk tolerance, and consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
