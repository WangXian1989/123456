The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money" and a great return on investment.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains, such as stocks, which are generally taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. You might also want to keep assets that generate qualified dividends in taxable accounts for the same reason.

3. **Prioritize Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in any account. This fund should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account type. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Age and Retirement Horizon**:
   - Adjust your investment strategy based on your age and how close you are to retirement. Younger investors might lean more heavily into stocks, while those nearing retirement might shift towards more conservative investments.

6. **Roth Conversions**:
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future, consider Roth conversions, which can allow you to pay taxes now at a lower rate.

7. **Ongoing Reassessment**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws.

It's often advisable to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that takes into account your individual circumstances and goals.
