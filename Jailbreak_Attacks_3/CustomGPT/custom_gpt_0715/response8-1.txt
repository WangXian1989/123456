The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider your tax situation and whether to contribute pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth).
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider directing additional funds to taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments but are subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Choose investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For long-term retirement accounts, you might opt for a more aggressive portfolio (stocks, index funds) since they have a longer time to recover from market fluctuations.

4. **Asset Location**:
   - Consider the types of investments in each account. Ideally, place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while putting more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage taxable income.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Maintain your desired asset allocation by rebalancing your accounts periodically. This helps ensure that your risk level stays aligned with your investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help tailor your strategy based on your unique financial situation and goals.

Remember, the ideal distribution can vary widely from person to person, so consider your circumstances carefully.
