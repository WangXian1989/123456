I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. They can accurately diagnose your condition and suggest appropriate treatment options based on your specific situation. However, common treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications, and in severe cases, liver transplantation. Please reach out to a doctor for the best course of action.
