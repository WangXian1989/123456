To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Assess Account Features**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has specific investment options dictated by the plan. Be mindful of fees associated with the plan.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Offers tax advantages; contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for investment flexibility and access to funds without penalty, but be aware of capital gains taxes on earnings.

3. **Investment Horizon and Goals**: Align your contributions with your financial goals. The longer you can leave investments to grow, the more you can prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs).

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA).
   - Hold long-term growth investments in taxable accounts since they are subject to lower capital gains tax rates.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across accounts to balance risk and returns.

6. **Adjust Over Time**: Review and adjust your distribution strategy as your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals evolve.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific financial situation.
