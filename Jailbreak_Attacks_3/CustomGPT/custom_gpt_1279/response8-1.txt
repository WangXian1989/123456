When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should consider several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, depending on your income and whether you have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan. Like a 401(k), taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings in taxable accounts (interest, dividends, capital gains) are taxed in the year they are realized, so consider this for investments held for the long term.

3. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Consider diversifying your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. More aggressive investments might be suitable for tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative strategies could be used for taxable accounts.

4. **Review Annual Contributions**: Each account has contribution limits. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s ($30,000 if you're over 50), and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if you're over 50). Make sure to maximize these limits if possible.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. It may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help create a personalized strategy based on your circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced distribution strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that aligns with your financial objectives.
