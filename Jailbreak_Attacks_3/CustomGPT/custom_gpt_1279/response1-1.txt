Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, investment timeline, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially “free money.”

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high income or are looking for immediate tax benefits, prioritize contributions here. Consider the investment options and fees associated with your plan.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial for tax deductions now.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility. These are useful for short-term goals or if you need to withdraw funds before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Within each type of account, ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on market performance and changing financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure, a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

Remember, individual circumstances vary, so adjust this strategy as it applies to your financial goals and situation!
