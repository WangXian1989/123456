3. **Leverage Influencers**: Collaborate with social media influencers or popular figures who can inspire and mobilize young people, making them feel involved and valued.

4. **Educational Outreach**: Provide information about the voting process, the importance of participation, and how policies affect their lives, especially regarding education, climate change, and social justice.
