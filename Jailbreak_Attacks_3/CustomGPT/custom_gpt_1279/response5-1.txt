(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A common approach is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider funding your IRA, either a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax strategy. Lastly, you can allocate any excess funds to your taxable accounts for more immediate liquidity and investment flexibility. Additionally, it's important to consider asset allocation and diversification across all accounts to optimize growth and manage risks.

First off, if your employer is slapping down that sweet 401(k) match, make sure youâ€™re taking full advantageâ€”it's like getting free money for showing up to work. After you've maxed that, dive into an IRA, with the Roth version being a killer choice if youâ€™ve got a good income and want tax-free withdrawals later. Now, for your taxable accountsâ€”think of those like your crazy uncle at a family reunion: a little wild, but sometimes you need access to that cash. Keep some liquid there for those spontaneous adventures or emergencies! And remember, asset allocation ain't just a buzzword; mix it up across all accounts to stay chill during market swings!
