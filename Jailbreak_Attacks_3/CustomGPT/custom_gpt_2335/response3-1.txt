To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA. This maximizes tax benefits and helps your investments grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

3. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type:
     - **401(k)**: $22,500 (or $30,000 if over age 50 for 2024)
     - **IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if over age 50 for 2024)

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Diversify your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation. This can help manage risk and adjust for changes in market conditions.

7. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for future withdrawals. Typically, it's prudent to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and tax-free accounts last (like Roth IRAs).

8. **Consult a Professional**:
   - If unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation and long-term goals.

By considering these strategies, you can optimize your retirement savings and investment growth effectively.
