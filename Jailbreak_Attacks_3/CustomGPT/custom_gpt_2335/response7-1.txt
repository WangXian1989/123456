To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**: Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first.
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions depending on your income.

2. **Investment Types**:
   - Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate interest or short-term gains, as these can incur higher taxes annually.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for the long term. Usually, youâ€™ll want to draw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Always keep an emergency fund in cash or low-risk accounts, separate from these investment accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk. 

6. **Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, life changes, and tax laws.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals.
