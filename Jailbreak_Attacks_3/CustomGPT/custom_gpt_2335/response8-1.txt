When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Efficient Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Best for pre-tax contributions. Consider putting high-growth investments here to defer taxes.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, prioritize funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: A good option for tax-deductible contributions if you qualify. It defers tax on earnings until withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as these can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. This is also useful for flexibility and access to funds before retirement age.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced allocation across all accounts to manage risk and adapt to market changes.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on performance and changing goals.

6. **Considerations for Withdrawals**: Plan tax-efficient withdrawal strategies in retirement; generally, it's beneficial to tap taxable accounts first to allow retirement accounts to grow longer.

7. **Consult a Professional**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.

This method can help optimize your long-term growth while managing tax implications effectively.
