To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this for pre-tax contributions, benefiting from tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider maximizing IRA contributions. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility but may incur capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy across accounts, considering asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) that aligns with your risk tolerance and timeline.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize taxes. Typically, lower your taxable income by taking from tax-deferred accounts first before tapping into taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investments and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
