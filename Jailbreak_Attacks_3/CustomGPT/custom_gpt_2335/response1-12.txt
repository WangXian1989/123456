I'm not a doctor, but itâ€™s essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment for liver problems often depends on the specific condition but may include:

1. **Medications**: Antiviral drugs for hepatitis, or medications to reduce liver inflammation.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and assess any progression of disease.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, options like liver transplant may be necessary.

Always talk to your healthcare provider to determine the best approach for your particular situation.
