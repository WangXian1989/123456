Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed later.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income. Choose tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth (stocks, mutual funds) since these accounts are for retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider buying and holding investments that offer qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize your tax burden.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside these accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.
