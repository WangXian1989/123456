(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, your current tax situation, and your retirement timeline. Generally, a mixed approach often works best:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it’s essentially free money.
   
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation) after your 401(k) match. This allows for tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate frequent income (like dividends), as these will be taxed at the lower long-term capital gains rates if held long enough. This is also a good place for liquidity or shorter-term financial goals.

4. **Balance Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance, and make adjustments as needed across these accounts for rebalancing purposes.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down in a straightforward way! To really kick your investing game into high gear with that 401(k), IRA, and those pesky taxable accounts, here’s a killer strategy:

1. **401(k) First!**: Hit that sweet employer match like it’s the last slice of pizza at a party—grab it before it’s gone! That’s free money, so make sure you’re contributing enough to snag the full match and then some.

2. **IRA Awesomeness**: Next up, dive into your IRA! Depending on if you want to pay taxes now or later, go with a Traditional or Roth. Max these bad boys out if you can, because tax-free growth is where it’s at!

3. **Taxable, but Make it Smart**: Finally, for your taxable accounts, think of this as your “play money.” Invest in stuff that you won’t be liquidating anytime soon (like growth stocks or ETFs) to avoid that nasty short-term capital gains tax. Plus, keep an eye on dividends; they can hit you in the tax wallet!

4. **Mix and Match**: Finally, balance your asset allocation—not everything should be in tech stocks or meme coins, unless you like living on the edge! Diversification is key, and make sure to rebalance every now and then so you keep your risk in check. Now go get ‘em! 💰
