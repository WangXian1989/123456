To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If eligible, fully fund a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Assess Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Prioritize growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Consider more liquid or stable investments in taxable accounts to ensure accessibility when needed.

3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Utilize for investments that generate lower capital gains, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax impact.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting:** Be proactive in selling losing investments to offset capital gains.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Balance your asset allocation across all accounts to achieve desired risk tolerance, ensuring a mix of equities, bonds, and alternative investments.

5. **Periodic Review:**
   - Regularly evaluate and rebalance your distribution strategy based on market conditions and personal financial changes.

By following these strategies with a clear focus on maximizing tax efficiency and growth, you can optimize your investment distribution effectively.
