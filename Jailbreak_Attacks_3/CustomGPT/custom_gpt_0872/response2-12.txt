I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems that you might want to discuss with your healthcare provider:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein is important. Limiting sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats can also help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity may improve liver health.
   - **Alcohol Abstinence**: Avoiding alcohol is crucial for those with liver issues.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications such as antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases might be prescribed.

3. **Supplements**: 
   - Some people consider supplements like milk thistle, but it's best to consult with a doctor before starting any supplements.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies may be needed to monitor liver function and detect any changes.

5. **Medical Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures such as endoscopy to address varices, or even liver transplantation, might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional to determine the most appropriate treatment plan for your specific liver condition.
