When it comes to dividing your cash among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it really depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general framework to consider:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s free money! After that, consider how much you can afford to contribute while balancing other needs.

2. **IRA:** Both Traditional and Roth IRAs have great tax advantages. If you're eligible, consider maxing out your contributions here as well. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth might be the way to go. If you think your tax rate will be lower, then the Traditional IRA might be better.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've optimized your tax-advantaged accounts, use a taxable account for funds you may need access to before retirement age or for short-term goals. 

**Distribution Strategy:**
- Prioritize the 401(k) up to the match.
- Max out your IRA contributions.
- Allocate any excess savings to your taxable account. 

Consider your investment horizon and risk tolerance for asset allocation. Always good to have a solid mix of stocks, bonds, and perhaps even some alternative investments in the mix. 

And don’t forget to periodically review and adjust based on performance and changing goals!
