Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money. After that, consider the following:
     - **Traditional 401(k)**: Lower your taxable income now but pay taxes during withdrawal.
     - **Roth 401(k)**: Pay taxes now, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

   - **IRA**: Similarly, contribute to either a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth) or Roth IRA (tax-free growth). Keep contribution limits in mind.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to a taxable account. This is attractive for flexibility and access to funds without penalties.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - Diversify your investment portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.
   - Generally, aggressive growth investments (like stocks) might be suited for Roth IRAs, while more stable investments (like bonds) could work well in a 401(k).

### 4. **Consult a Professional**
   - Individual circumstances vary widely, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

### Key Takeaways
- **Max out tax-advantaged accounts** first, then invest in taxable accounts.
- Tailor your asset allocation based on your retirement timeline and risk appetite.
- Stay informed on contribution limits and tax implications.
