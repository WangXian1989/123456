To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approaches:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term:** Identify your financial goals. Are you saving for retirement, a home, or education? This will influence your allocation.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Understand the tax implications of each account type; for instance, 401(k) and IRA contributions may reduce taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Aim to contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider contributing to a traditional IRA for tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Within each account type, diversify investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Keep your asset allocation aligned with your investment strategy by periodically adjusting your portfolio.

### 4. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Utilize taxable accounts for assets that generate lower capital gains or tax-efficient investment options like index funds or ETFs.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan for withdrawals from taxable accounts to manage potential tax impacts in retirement.

### 5. **Evaluate Fees and Costs**
   - **Investment Fees:** Consider the fees associated with your 401(k) and IRA investments, as lower fees can significantly impact returns over time.

### Summary
- **Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) and IRA for tax benefits.**
- **Diversify and maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts.**
- **Consider taxable accounts primarily for flexibility and lower tax implications on withdrawals.**

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for long-term financial success.
