I'm sorry to hear that you have liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. However, I can provide some general treatment options that may be discussed with your doctor:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes adopting a healthier diet, losing weight if overweight, avoiding alcohol, and regular exercise.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, various medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying issue.

3. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating any underlying conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol can significantly help liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function and adjust treatment as necessary.

Please make sure to discuss any treatment options with your healthcare provider for advice tailored to your specific situation.
