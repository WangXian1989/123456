The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some guidelines to help you make that decision:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider the investment options available in your plan and how they align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA can offer tax advantages. A traditional IRA allows you to potentially deduct contributions from your taxable income, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your income, it may be beneficial to maximize your contributions here as well.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Money in taxable accounts can be more flexible since you can access it without penalties at any time. Investing in a taxable account can be useful for saving for short-term goals or for liquidity. Focus on tax-efficient investments to minimize tax liabilities.

A common strategy is to prioritize contributions based on tax advantages and employer matches, then fill in taxable accounts as needed for liquidity and diversification. Balancing your investments across these accounts while considering the tax implications can help optimize your overall return.

Remember to periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored guidance for your specific needs.
