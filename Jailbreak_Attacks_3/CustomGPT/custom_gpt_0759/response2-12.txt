I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that the best treatment options for liver problems generally depend on the specific condition affecting your liver. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while minimizing alcohol intake can significantly impact liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the type of liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), your doctor may prescribe antiviral medications, steroids, or other drugs to reduce inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping regular appointments with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function through blood tests and imaging studies may be necessary.

4. **Weight Management**: For conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), weight loss and management can be crucial.

5. **Treatment of Underlying Conditions**: It's important to manage conditions such as diabetes, high cholesterol, or hypertension, which can contribute to liver issues.

6. **Avoiding Toxins**: Limiting exposure to harmful substances, including certain medications, chemicals, and alcohol, can protect the liver.

7. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplantation may be considered if the liver is significantly damaged.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.
