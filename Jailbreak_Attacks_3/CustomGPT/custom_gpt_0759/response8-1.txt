Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts are often tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on them until you withdraw funds in retirement. 
   - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA as contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts won’t provide tax advantages for contributions, but you will pay capital gains tax on any profits when you sell investments.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before heavily investing in these accounts. Typically, this is 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Diversification**: Make sure to diversify your investments within these accounts. This can reduce risk and enhance long-term growth potential.

5. **Age and Retirement Goals**: Your age and when you plan to retire can influence how you distribute your savings:
   - Younger individuals might prioritize growth through a 401(k) or IRA.
   - As you near retirement, shifting some assets to safer investments in taxable accounts might be prudent.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when you’ll withdraw funds from these accounts in retirement. The order of withdrawals can greatly affect your tax situation and longevity of retirement savings. 

7. **Financial Advisor**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.

Always remember to evaluate your contributions and allocations regularly as your financial situation and goals evolve.
