(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, you may want to prioritize your contributions based on tax advantages:

1. Maximize your 401(k) contributions if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially free money. 
2. Next, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now.
3. After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can focus on your taxable accounts, which offer flexibility and access to funds, although they may be subject to capital gains taxes.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your unique situation.

Itâ€™s like finding cash in your couch cushions! Then swing over to your IRA; if you can rock a Roth, do it! Tax-free growth is like a party without the cleanup. After you fill your tax-advantaged accounts more than a candy jar, you've got a taxable account sitting there like that last slice of pizza. Itâ€™s great for flexibility and all, but remember, Uncle Sam wants his cut when you cash out. So, get your financial ducks in a row and maybe grab a financial advisor for extra flair to your money moves! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’¸
