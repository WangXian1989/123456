Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guide to help you allocate your funds effectively:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA:** After securing the match, consider putting money into a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your taxable income and tax preferences.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional contributions once you've maximized your 401(k) and IRA (as per contribution limits).

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax money, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You’ll pay capital gains tax on profits, so consider the tax implications of selling investments.

### 3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-term:** Focus on growth-oriented investments within retirement accounts that provide tax advantages.
   - **Short-term:** Consider more liquid and lower-risk investments in taxable accounts to meet near-term goals.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing risk based on your overall investment strategy.

### 5. **Regular Reviews:**
   - Periodically review your allocation as your financial situation changes and adjust contributions accordingly.

### Sample Allocation Strategy:**
- **401(k):** 10-15% of your income until you meet the company match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions up to the limit ($6,500-$7,500 depending on age).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate surplus funds after maxing out retirement accounts.

### Conclusion:
Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals. Regularly assessing your investment strategy will help you stay on track for retirement and other financial objectives.
