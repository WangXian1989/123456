Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a structured approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k)):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to maximize this benefit. It’s essentially “free” money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA and 401(k)):** Prioritize funding tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. Contributions may lower your taxable income, and the investments grow tax-free until withdrawal.

3. **Roth Options:** Consider a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide more liquidity and flexibility, especially if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:** Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider the tax implications of different investments; for instance, holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts can be more beneficial due to interest income being taxed at ordinary rates.

6. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your investment strategy and distribution based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.
