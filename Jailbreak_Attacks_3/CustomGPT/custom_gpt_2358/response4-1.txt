Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to get the full benefit.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), providing immediate tax advantages or tax-free growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Income Limits**: Consider any income limits that may affect your ability to contribute to a Roth IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these accounts for shorter-term goals or if you want to access funds without penalties before retirement age.
   - **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes, especially on frequently traded investments.

### General Strategy:
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate savings in liquid form.
2. **Debt Management**: Prioritize paying off high-interest debt before investing.
3. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on risk tolerance across your accounts.
4. **Tax Consideration**: Invest higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating assets in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

### Suggested Allocation:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to secure the employer match, then assess any remaining capacity.
- **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, contribute up to the max limit in your chosen IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional funds can go towards a taxable account for flexibility.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this approach based on your specific circumstances and retirement goals.
