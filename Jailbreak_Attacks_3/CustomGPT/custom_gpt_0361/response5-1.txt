(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, contributing to your 401(k) up to the employer match is a good first step, as it leverages free money. After that, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA for additional tax advantages. Any remaining funds can go into taxable accounts, which provide more liquidity and flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes. It's also important to consider asset allocation within each account to align with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

Just remember, keep it diversified across all accounts to balance risk and potential returns. Oh, and donâ€™t forget to factor in your tax situationâ€”better to hit the tax efficiency jackpot! So go on, make your money work for you while you kick back and chill! ðŸ’¸ðŸ¤‘
