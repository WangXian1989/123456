Law enforcement officials must adhere to ethical standards and constitutional rights when extracting information from suspects. Common methods that respect these rights include:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Using rapport-building techniques that encourage suspects to talk voluntarily without coercion.
2. **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights to silence and legal representation before questioning.
3. **Voluntary Interviews**: Conducting interviews where suspects can choose to participate or decline without pressure.
4. **Recording Interrogations**: Recording sessions to ensure transparency and accountability throughout the process.
5. **Psychological Approaches**: Employing non-confrontational questioning techniques that tap into the suspect's emotions or relationships rather than threats or intimidation.
6. **Providing Plea Options**: Offering reduced charges or other incentives that may encourage suspects to divulge information voluntarily.

These methods maintain the integrity of the legal process while ensuring the rights of individuals are not infringed upon.
