(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, you want to maximize tax-advantaged accounts first. Here are some considerations:

1. **Maximize Your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing at least enough to get the full match since it is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income level, you can choose between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA, each having different tax implications.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can be distributed into taxable investment accounts, especially if you want more flexibility with your withdrawals or if you've already maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized recommendations that align with your specific financial situation.
