Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Gains grow tax-deferred or tax-free if using a Roth 401(k).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual limits ($6,500 for IRA contributions in 2023, with a $1,000 catch-up for those over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Perfect for short-term goals, liquidity, and if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

### Recommended Strategy

1. **Maximize 401(k)**: Prioritize contributions up to the employer match.
2. **Max Out IRA**: If eligible, prioritize Roth or traditional IRA contributions next.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest additional funds in a taxable account.

### Additional Considerations

- **Investment Goals**: Align portfolio allocation with your goals (retirement, education, etc.).
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust the proportion of stocks, bonds, and cash according to your comfort with risk.
- **Time Horizon**: The longer until you need the money, the more you might favor growth investments.
