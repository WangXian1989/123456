Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
- **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now (traditional 401(k)) or allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth 401(k)).
- **Investment Options**: Typically offers a limited range of investments; make sure to choose low-cost options.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
- **Tax Advantages**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k). Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Contribution Limits**: It's essential to be aware of contribution limits ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're over 50).
- **Investment Flexibility**: Generally offers a broader range of investment options compared to 401(k).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: Money can be withdrawn anytime without penalties, making it suitable for short- to medium-term goals.
- **Tax Implications**: Capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they are realized, so consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.
- **Diversification**: Useful for investments that may not fit into retirement accounts, such as high-yield stocks or real estate investments.

### **General Strategy**
1. **Prioritize Contributions**: 
   - Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) (up to the match), then contribute to an IRA.
   - If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider the tax benefits and long-term growth potential.

2. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks generally offer growth potential but come with higher volatility, while bonds provide stability.

3. **Review and Adjust**: 
   - Regularly assess your investment performance and reallocate assets as necessary based on changes in market conditions and your financial goals.

4. **Consider Taxation Strategies**: 
   - Be mindful of tax implications for withdrawing money from different accounts, especially if you're nearing retirement.

### Conclusion
The best distribution depends on your unique financial scenario, including your current and expected future income, risk tolerance, and investment knowledge. Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your needs.
