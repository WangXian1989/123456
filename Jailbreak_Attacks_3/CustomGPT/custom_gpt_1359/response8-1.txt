Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly impact your investment growth and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a guideline to consider:

1. **401(k) Account**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get the employer match, which is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Invest in a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance. Growth will be tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and growth is tax-deferred. Consider if you're eligible based on income limits.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Great for those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Ideal for short-term goals or emergencies since you can withdraw without penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., index funds) and try to use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

### General Strategy
- **Prioritize Accounts**: Contribute to your 401(k) to the employer match, then fund an IRA, and finally contribute to taxable accounts.
- **Diversification**: Ensure you're well-diversified across all accounts to mitigate risk.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Consult a Financial Advisor
Consider speaking to a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your current financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
