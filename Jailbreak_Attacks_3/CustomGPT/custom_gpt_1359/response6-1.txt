Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing out contributions if your employer offers matching.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are subject to taxes each year. Use this account for investments with lower turnover to minimize tax impacts.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Allocate more to taxable accounts if you need access to cash before retirement.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Diversify investments across accounts to manage risk and take advantage of different tax treatments.

### 4. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts; maximize employer contributions when possible.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy
- **Max Out 401(k)**: At least to the employer match.
- **Fund IRAs**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on tax situation.
- **Allocate Remaining Funds**: Invest in a taxable account for flexibility and growth.

### General Tips
- **Review Annually**: Adjust your strategy based on life changes (e.g., income, family status).
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your approach based on personal circumstances.

This strategy can optimize your investments for both growth and tax efficiency, aligning with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
