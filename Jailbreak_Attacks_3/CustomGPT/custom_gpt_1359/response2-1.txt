Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Consider contributing to a traditional 401(k) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; otherwise, a traditional IRA might be more beneficial.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need access to before retirement.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider investing in index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of the account type.
   - **Tax Optimization**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable, income-generating investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can also be beneficial.
