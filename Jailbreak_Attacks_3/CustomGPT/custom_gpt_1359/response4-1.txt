To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: This is typically a pre-tax account, meaning you can reduce your taxable income by contributing. Prioritize maxing out contributions to take advantage of employer matches if available.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Like a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This can be a valuable option for tax diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income (e.g., dividends, interest). Investments in this account should be managed carefully to minimize taxes.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Assess your short-term and long-term goals. Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth investments (like stocks) and more stable investments (like bonds) for shorter-term goals in taxable accounts.

3. **Asset Location**:
   - Place high-growth investments like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or eliminate taxes. Consider holding income-generating investments like bonds or REITs in taxable accounts to utilize lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. In 2023, the limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if youâ€™re over 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50).

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts. This ensures adherence to your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation, income level, tax bracket, and financial goals.

By strategically distributing your money among these accounts, you can maximize your investment growth while managing tax implications effectively.
