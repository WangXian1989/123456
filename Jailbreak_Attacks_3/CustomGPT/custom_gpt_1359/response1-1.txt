Distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, current tax situation, investment timeframe, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are typically tax-deductible now, with taxes owed upon withdrawal. Useful for higher-income years.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in these for flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes. Use strategies like tax-loss harvesting to minimize tax impacts.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) to spread risk.
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on where the money is. For example, you might want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your taxable account to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 4. **Emergency Funds and Liquidity**
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquidity for emergencies. Avoid putting too much into less accessible accounts if you need cash flow.

### 5. **Ongoing Review and Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review your investment performance and asset allocation to ensure they align with your goals and adjust as needed.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized financial advice can help navigate your specific situation, especially regarding tax planning and retirement strategy.

By considering these factors, you can develop a strategy that aligns with your financial goals and maximizes your resources over time.
