(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing your employer match, consider funding your IRA (Traditional or Roth) next, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit, particularly if it offers tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate high taxable income, such as bonds or frequent trading. Accounts can also be beneficial for short-term goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Assess your distribution and performance annually to ensure you're aligned with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.

1. **401(k)**: First off, hustle for that employer match in your 401(k). It's like a freebie from your bossâ€”donâ€™t leave it on the table!

2. **IRA Time**: Next up, if you're eligible, smash some cash into your IRA. A Roth IRA lets you take out the dough tax-free later, which is pretty sweet. But if you want that tax break now, go for the Traditional IRA.

3. **Keep Feeding the 401(k)**: Once those accounts are loaded, keep pumping money into your 401(k) up to the maxâ€”tax-deferred growth is your buddy.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, stash some cash in taxable accounts for flexibility. Theyâ€™re like your emergency snacksâ€”great for short-term needs.

5. **Regular Check-ins**: Donâ€™t forget to regularly check your asset allocations, like a pit stop to tweak the engine. You want everything running smoothly to hit those financial goals!
