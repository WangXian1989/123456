When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it's essentially "free money." The contribution limit for 401(k) accounts is higher than for IRAs, making it a great way to save.
   - **IRA:** After contributing to your 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA if you're eligible (consider both Traditional and Roth IRA options depending on your tax situation). 

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Traditional accounts** (401(k) and Traditional IRA) allow for pre-tax contributions, meaning you won't pay taxes until you withdraw funds, typically in retirement. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in the future.
   - **Roth accounts** (Roth IRA) require after-tax contributions, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Balance Risk and Growth:**
   - Allocate your investments based on your timeframe and risk tolerance. Generally, you might want to have a more aggressive investment strategy in accounts with a longer time horizon to benefit from compound interest.
   - Taxable accounts might hold investments that generate income or short-term gains, while retirement accounts can generally be invested more aggressively since they are designed for long-term growth.

4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of living expenses) in a high-yield savings account for liquidity.

5. **Consider Future Withdrawals:**
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Understand the rules around required minimum distributions (RMDs) for 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs, and strategize to minimize taxes on withdrawals.

6. **Review Regularly:**
   - Reassess your investment strategy regularly or after major life events (like marriage, buying a house, etc.) to ensure your asset allocation still aligns with your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Depending on the complexity of your financial situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Ultimately, the best way to distribute your money will depend on your unique situation, so consider these factors while developing your strategy.
