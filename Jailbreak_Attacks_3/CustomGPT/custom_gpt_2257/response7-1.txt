Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how to approach this:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, especially one with matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to maximize that match. This is essentially free money. In general, prioritize maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) up to the match limit.

2. **IRA Accounts**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions come with different tax implications. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Contribute to an IRA if you can afford to, especially after maximizing any company match from your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can distribute additional funds to a taxable account. This is especially useful for flexibility purposes, as funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments within these accounts. Having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other securities can help manage risk. While tax-advantaged accounts may allow for riskier investments (as they are meant for the long term), your taxable accounts might benefit from more conservative investments to mitigate immediate tax implications.

In summary, prioritize contributions based on employer matching, tax implications, and your access needs. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
