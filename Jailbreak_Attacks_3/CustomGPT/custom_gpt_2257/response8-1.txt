As an AI language model, I can provide some general guidelines for distributing funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. However, it's important to tailor your strategy based on individual circumstances, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, consider contributing enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deferral**: Contributions reduce your taxable income for the year, and growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your choice depends on your current tax rate vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits (as of 2023, it's $6,500 for those under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and older across IRAs).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable investment accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals, but you’ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) in each account type to manage risk effectively.

5. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Before maximizing contributions, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund, typically three to six months’ worth of living expenses.

6. **Future Goals**:
   - Align your contributions with your retirement timeline and other financial goals (such as buying a home or funding education).

7. **Consultation**: 
   - It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy considering your unique financial situation.

A common approach is to prioritize contributions to the 401(k) for the match, max out the IRA for tax advantages, and then focus on the taxable account for additional flexibility. Always reassess your strategy annually or when significant financial life changes occur.
