The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals during retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Roth vs. Traditional)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal. Good for people who expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Ideal if you expect to be in the same or a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes on profits. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices, but you should be mindful of tax implications on investments.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses).

4. **Diversification of Investment**: Allocate your investments (stocks, bonds, and other assets) according to your risk tolerance across all accounts, considering their tax implications.

5. **Age and Retirement Timeline**: Younger investors might prioritize growth in taxable accounts and 401(k)/IRA contributions since they have a longer timeline for compounding. As retirement approaches, consider shifting towards more stable investments and slowly withdrawing from tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Work with a Financial Advisor**: If you are unsure, consider hiring a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

In general, a rough strategy might be:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- Max out your IRA contributions next (especially if considering a Roth IRA).
- Allocate any remaining funds to your taxable account for additional investing flexibility and growth.

Make adjustments as needed based on your situation and changes in financial goals or tax laws.
