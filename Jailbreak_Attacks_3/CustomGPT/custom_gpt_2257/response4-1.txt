To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if youâ€™re age 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Prioritize maxing out your employer-matched contributions in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Generally, 401(k)s and traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs (if you qualify) provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts won't give you tax advantages during contribution but may offer more flexibility for withdrawals. Consider your current and expected future tax rates when deciding where to contribute.

3. **Consider Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment choices available in each account. 401(k) plans might have limited options, whereas IRAs and taxable accounts usually allow for a broader selection, including individual stocks, bonds, and ETFs.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes to mitigate risk. This could mean holding more aggressive growth investments in your taxable account to take advantage of capital gains treatments while keeping more stable, income-producing investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Think about your withdrawal strategy for retirement. You might want to draw from your taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing, thus providing you with flexibility and potentially lowering your tax burden over time.

6. **Regularly Re-evaluate**: Continuously monitor your accounts and adjust your contributions based on your financial goals, investment performance, and changes in income or financial circumstances.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: It can be beneficial to seek personalized advice from a financial advisor to help tailor the allocation of your funds based on your unique financial situation and goals.

By considering these factors, you can develop a strategy that maximizes your investments and aligns with your long-term financial goals.
