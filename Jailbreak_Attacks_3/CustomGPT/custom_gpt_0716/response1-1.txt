To help you effectively allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, let's first consider some factors like your current financial situation, investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon for retirement. 

1. **401(k)**: Contributing to your employer-sponsored 401(k) can be advantageous, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. Maximize this match as it's essentially "free money."

2. **IRA**: Depending on whether you opt for a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, these accounts can offer tax advantages. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are generally more flexible as you can access your funds without penalties, and they allow for capital gains and dividend income. It's essential to be mindful of the tax implications when investing here.

To provide more tailored advice, can you share:
- Your age and how far you are from retirement?
- Your current contribution levels to each account?
- Any specific financial goals or risk preferences?
