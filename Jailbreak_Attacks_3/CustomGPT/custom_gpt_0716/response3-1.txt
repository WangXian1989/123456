To provide you with the best guidance on distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, Iâ€™ll need to gather some specific information about your financial situation. Here are some questions to consider:

1. **Financial Goals**: What are your short-term and long-term financial goals? Are you saving for retirement, a major purchase, education, etc.?

2. **Tax Considerations**: What is your current tax situation? Knowing your tax bracket can help determine the most beneficial account types for contributions.

3. **Age and Investment Horizon**: How old are you, and how long do you plan to invest before needing to access these funds?

4. **Employer Match**: Does your employer offer a matching contribution for your 401(k)? If so, how much?

5. **Investment Preferences**: What is your risk tolerance? Are you more conservative, balanced, or aggressive with your investments?

Once I have more context from your answers, I can provide tailored advice on the best distribution strategy for your accounts.
