To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this for pre-tax contributions. It grows tax-deferred and can be a good option for high-income earners, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, allowing for tax-free withdrawals. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions that can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with lower expected turnover, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. They can also house investments that are not tax-advantaged or for short-term needs.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments in each account are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk effectively.

4. **Retirement Timeline**: If you’re closer to retirement, you might want to be more conservative with your investments. Shift more to bonds and income-generating investments.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement; usually, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-advantaged accounts later to minimize taxes.

Ultimately, the optimal distribution depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.
