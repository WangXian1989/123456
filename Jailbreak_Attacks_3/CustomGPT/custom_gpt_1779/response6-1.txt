Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a structured approach:

How Should I Distribute My Money Among 401(k), IRA, and Taxable Accounts? ðŸ’°

### Market Resolution
- **401(k):** Prioritize contributions to get any employer match (often up to 5-6% of your salary). This is tax-deferred growth and often the best initial step.
- **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next (for 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). This allows for tax-free growth in the case of a Roth IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing the above, use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments. These accounts offer more flexibility but come with capital gains taxes.
