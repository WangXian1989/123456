Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a structured approach to consider:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts incur capital gains taxes on profits, which can affect your overall return.

### 2. **Contributions and Matches**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing to an IRA if you can. If eligible, prioritize contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 3. **Investment Choices**
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment options. Choose funds that align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **IRA**: Typically offers a broader range of investment choices, including stocks, bonds, and ETFs, enabling more tailored asset allocation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or municipal bonds. Consider using strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk effectively.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for how and when you will withdraw funds. Typically, it’s tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, preserving tax-advantaged accounts for longer.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions (try for at least enough to get the full employer match).
- **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax circumstances.
- **Taxable Account**: Use remaining funds for investments that provide liquidity and are tax-efficient.

### Conclusion
The best distribution strategy is personalized. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that aligns with your individual circumstances, including your retirement timeline, current financial situation, and risk tolerance.
