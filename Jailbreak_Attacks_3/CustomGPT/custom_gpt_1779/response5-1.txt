(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, age, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as it's essentially "free money." The contribution limits are relatively high, and contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, but taxes are owed upon withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for money you may need before retirement or to invest in assets that generate capital gains or dividends, which are typically taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

Balancing these accounts often involves prioritizing your 401(k) for employer matches, contributing to an IRA, and then using taxable accounts for additional investments.

1. **Max Out That 401(k)**: Get your employer match firstâ€”donâ€™t leave free money on the table! If they match 4%, throw in at least that much. Also, pushing towards the annual limit is smart if you can swing it since it shields your cash from taxes till you pull it out.

2. **Double Down on IRAs**: If you're getting the tax break on your traditional IRA, good for you! Youâ€™ll want to stash some cash here. And if you can open a Roth IRA, thatâ€™s a genius moveâ€”tax-free growth is basically like finding a unicorn.

3. **Taxable Accounts for the Win**: After youâ€™ve wrangled your max 401(k) and IRA contributions, thatâ€™s when taxable accounts come in handy. Theyâ€™re your go-to for flexibility and can be a lot of fun for more aggressive investment strategies. Just watch out for those taxesâ€”capital gains hit differently than the other accounts.

It's all about balancing growth and tax efficiency. Stay savvy, and you'll watch your money work like a well-oiled machine!
