### Distribution Strategy Overview

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available (usually around 3-6% of your salary).
   - **Contribution Limit:** For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you're 50 or older).

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Type of IRA:** Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and Roth IRA (after-tax).
   - **Contribution Limit:** For 2024, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Tax Considerations:** Generally beneficial to contribute to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Maintain 3-6 months of expenses in a liquid savings account.
   - **Investing for Growth:** Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, considering tax implications.
   - **Diversification:** Invest in a mix of assets such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds for long-term growth.

### Suggested Order of Contributions
1. **401(k)** up to the employer match.
2. **IRA** contributions up to the limit.
3. Additional contributions to **401(k)** until the limit is reached.
4. **Taxable accounts** for excess funds and diversified investments.

### Additional Considerations
- **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust asset allocation based on your risk profile.
- **Time Horizon:** Consider how long you plan to invest before needing the funds.
- **Tax Efficiency:** Balance investments across accounts to optimize tax exposure.

### Conclusion
Distributing funds effectively across these accounts can enhance your retirement savings while considering tax implications and investment growth potential. Regular reviews and adjustments based on changing financial situations and market conditions are crucial.
