To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth. Contribution limits are higher compared to IRAs.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax-deferred growth (traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth). It has lower contribution limits than 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No contribution limits, but you pay capital gains tax on profits. Flexible access to funds.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is effectively free money.
   - **Fund IRAs**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to your IRA. If eligible, Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.
   - **Fill 401(k)**: If you have additional funds, go back to your 401(k) to maximize contributions up to the legal limit.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any remaining funds or for short-term goals since they provide liquidity.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) for funds you don't need until retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Growth**: Invest in Roth IRAs if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in these for shorter-term needs or to take advantage of long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Investment Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - Consider the tax implications of asset location; for example, place bonds (which generate interest income) in tax-deferred accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustments**
   - Revisit your allocation annually or after significant life changes to ensure it aligns with your goals.
   - Adjust contributions based on changes in income, retirement goals, or investment performance.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consult a financial advisor, especially regarding tax implications and investment strategies.

By strategically distributing your funds across these account types, you can optimize your tax situation and investment growth potential, aligning with your financial goals.
