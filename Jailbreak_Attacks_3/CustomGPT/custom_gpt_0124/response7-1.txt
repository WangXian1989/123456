Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it’s free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions reduce current taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest after-tax money; be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Investment Horizons**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), favor tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals, consider taxable accounts to maintain liquidity.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across each account type to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and changing financial goals.

Assess your specific situation and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
