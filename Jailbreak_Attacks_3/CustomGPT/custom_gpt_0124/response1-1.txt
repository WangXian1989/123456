Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; it's essentially free money.
   - **Consider Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Prioritize if Under Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions to take advantage of tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may want to access before retirement age without penalties.
   - **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Focus on investments with lower tax implications, such as index funds and ETFs.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings for emergencies before maximizing retirement accounts.
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.
- **Reevaluate Regularly**: Your situation may change, so reassess your allocations periodically based on life changes or market conditions.

### Consult a Professional:
Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
