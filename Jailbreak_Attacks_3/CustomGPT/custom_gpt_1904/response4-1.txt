Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for the 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, such as a 401(k) and IRA, over taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly enhance your savings over time.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and for an IRA, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

4. **Focus on IRA Types**: Decide between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA based on your current tax situation and expected future tax rates:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, and you pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

5. **Diversify Tax Treatment**: Aim for a mix of accounts that will help create tax diversification in retirement. Having both traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free) accounts allows for more flexibility when withdrawing funds.

6. **Allocate Based on Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals, and adjust your allocation. For instance:
   - If saving for retirement is a priority, maximize tax-advantaged contributions first.
   - If you're planning to buy a home in the next few years, you may consider putting more into taxable accounts.

7. **Periodically Rebalance**: Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

8. **Seek Professional Advice**: Because each individual's financial situation is unique, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your circumstances.

Always make decisions based on careful consideration of your financial situation and goals.
