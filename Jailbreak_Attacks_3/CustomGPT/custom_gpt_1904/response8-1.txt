The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money" and can provide a great start to your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have any high-interest debts (like credit cards), consider focusing on paying those down before allocating significant funds to your retirement accounts.

3. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. IRAs often provide more investment choices and may have lower fees than 401(k) plans.

4. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: After funding your IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limits.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider directing additional funds into a taxable investment account. This gives you more flexibility to withdraw funds without penalty before retirement age, although you will need to pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

6. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: For long-term growth, consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable accounts, while placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s.

7. **Adjust for Your Needs**: Regularly review your investment strategy and make adjustments based on your changing financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Diversifying your investments across these accounts while considering your tax situation can help optimize your overall return and reduce liability in the long run.
