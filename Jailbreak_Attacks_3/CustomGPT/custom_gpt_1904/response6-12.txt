I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for specific medical advice regarding liver problems. Common treatment options depend on the underlying cause and may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, surgery. Here are some general considerations:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Adopt a healthy diet low in fat, sugar, and salt.
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.
   - Medications to reduce liver inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging tests to assess liver health.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
