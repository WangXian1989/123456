To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to maximize that benefit. This is essentially free money.
   - **Traditional IRA:** If you're eligible for a tax deduction, consider funding this account next, as contributions can lower your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize Roth IRA contributions for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Allocate Based on Investment Goals:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity. Invest in funds that generate lower taxable income (e.g., index funds).
   - **Retirement Accounts:** Focus on higher growth investments (stocks, mutual funds) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compounding and tax deferral.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan your contributions keeping in mind how and when you will withdraw funds during retirement. Typically, it might be advantageous to withdraw first from taxable accounts to allow the tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 4. **Balance Risk and Return:**
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds) in all accounts, adjusting based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation within each account, taking into consideration market conditions and any changes in your financial situation or retirement plans.

By strategically allocating your contributions this way, you can optimize tax benefits and investment growth potential.
