Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider putting money into a Traditional or Roth IRA. If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial. Conversely, if you expect higher taxes later, a Roth IRA could be the way to go.

3. **Fund Your 401(k)**: After maximizing the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k), especially if you can benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investment beyond your retirement accounts, particularly for short-term goals or if you want flexibility with withdrawals. These can also be a good place for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

Remember to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these suggestions to your individual situation.
