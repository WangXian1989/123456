To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains in the year they are realized.

2. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Ensure you're aware of annual contribution limits for each account type (e.g., 401(k) and IRA).

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your short-term and long-term goals. Taxable accounts are typically better for short-term goals, while 401(k) and IRA are suited for long-term retirement savings.

4. **Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match before funding other accounts. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: 
   - Consider how soon you'll need access to your money. Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

6. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified in terms of asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.).

7. **Fees**: 
   - Be mindful of any fees associated with these accounts, especially in your 401(k), which may affect your overall returns.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first.
2. **Max out IRA Contributions**: After the match, consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax benefits.
3. **Taxable Investing**: Use any leftover funds for taxable accounts, especially if you have specific goals in mind that require more liquidity.

Lastly, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation and goals.
