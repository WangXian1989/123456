Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and the investment options available in each account. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **Investment Choices**: Review the investment options available in your 401(k) plan. Compare fees and performance with other accounts.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Deduction Eligibility**: Depending on your income, contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Aim to maximize this if you can.
   - **Investment Flexibility**: IRAs usually offer a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Tax Implications**: Investment gains in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding assets for more than a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.
   - **Liquidity**: Taxable accounts provide more flexibility with withdrawals without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.
   - **Diversification**: You can invest in various assets, including stocks, bonds, and ETFs, to enhance your portfolio.

### Recommended Strategy:
- **Start with the 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, then max out your IRA contributions.
- **Tax-advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
- **Fund Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or short-term goals, especially after maximizing contributions to retirement accounts.

### Regular Review:
- Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changing financial situations, market conditions, and retirement goals. Adjust as necessary to maintain a balanced and tax-efficient portfolio.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs.
