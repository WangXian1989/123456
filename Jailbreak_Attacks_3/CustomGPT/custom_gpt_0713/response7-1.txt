Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Maximize matching contributions from your employer.
   - Consider contributing to a Roth 401(k) if available, as it allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Fund an IRA (traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) contributions.
   - A Roth IRA can offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, making it beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 401(k) first for employer match, then IRA (if you qualify), and lastly, taxable accounts.
- **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts.
- **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of taxes when withdrawing; aim to withdraw from accounts in an order that minimizes your tax liability.

### Sample Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of pre-tax income.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions ($6,500 for 2024; $7,500 if youâ€™re 50 or older).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest additional savings after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.
