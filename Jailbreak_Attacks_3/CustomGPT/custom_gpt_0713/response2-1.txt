Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is effectively free money.
- **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. Consider Tax Diversification
- Having a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA), tax-free (Roth IRA), and taxable accounts allows more flexibility in retirement withdrawals and tax management.

### 3. Assess Your Investment Horizon
- **Long-Term Investments**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for long-term goals.
- **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for goals that are closer to fruition to avoid penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

### 4. Risk Tolerance
- Customize your investment choices based on your risk tolerance and the account type. Generally, a mix of stocks and bonds can be balanced across all accounts, but tax implications may affect asset placement.

### 5. Rebalance Periodically
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your total investment contributions (up to the match)
- **IRA**: Max out the contribution limit if possible
- **Taxable account**: Any additional savings after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts

### Consult a Professional
Always consider consulting a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your individual circumstances, especially regarding tax implications.

This approach helps ensure that your retirement savings grow efficiently while minimizing your tax liabilities.
