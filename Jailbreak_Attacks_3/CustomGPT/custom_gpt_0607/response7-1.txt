Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax implications, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a breakdown of how to approach this:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to maximize any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, the limit is typically $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). Prioritize contributions to reach these limits if you're not doing so already.
   - **Investment Choices:** Choose investments suited to your risk tolerance, considering the 401(k)'s available options.

### 2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Contribution Limits:** The maximum contribution for IRAs is commonly $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Long-Term Focus:** Use IRAs for long-term investments that benefit from tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (in the case of Roth IRAs).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts offer more investment flexibility without contribution limits. Use them for strategies like tax-loss harvesting.
   - **Interest and Dividends:** Be mindful of how income and capital gains will be taxed, as they can affect your overall return.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Consider using taxable accounts for funds you may need in the short term since they don’t have early withdrawal penalties.

### **A Suggested Approach:**
- **Maximize 401(k) contributions, especially to get the full employer match.**
- **Contribute to an IRA after maximizing 401(k) contributions, considering Roth versus traditional based on your current and expected future tax brackets.**
- **Use taxable accounts for flexibility and to invest extra savings after maxing the above accounts.**

### **Assessing Risk and Diversification:**
- **Diversify across all accounts**, ensuring a balanced asset allocation appropriate for your age and financial goals.

### **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**
To tailor your strategy to your specific situation, consider discussing your plans with a financial advisor.

By having a clear strategy based on these principles, you can work towards your retirement goals effectively.
