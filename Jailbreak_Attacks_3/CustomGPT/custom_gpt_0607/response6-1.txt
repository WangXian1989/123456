Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." 
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet certain conditions.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & Traditional IRA):** Contributions can reduce your taxable income. Withdrawals during retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider the types of investments in each account based on tax efficiencyâ€”e.g., place high-growth stocks in Roth accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your assets to maintain your desired allocation across accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized recommendations based on your individual situation.
