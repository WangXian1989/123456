To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: If you can afford it, aim to max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions:
   - For 2024, the maximum contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (with extra catch-up contributions for those aged 50+).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide similar tax advantages to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don't provide tax benefits upfront, but capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Investment Allocation**: 
   - **Growth Assets in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Keep higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Income Generating Assets in Taxable Accounts**: Hold bonds and dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts, as youâ€™ll be taxed on these distributions regardless.

5. **Emergency Fund and Other Needs**: Maintain an adequate emergency fund in easily accessible savings accounts before committing all your funds to investment accounts.

6. **Regularly Review**: Continually assess your portfolio and rebalance according to your changing financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, consider working with a financial professional.

This diversified strategy helps you balance immediate tax benefits with long-term retirement growth.
