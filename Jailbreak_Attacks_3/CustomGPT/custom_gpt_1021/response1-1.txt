When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to think about a few key factors, such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Maximize contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Consider funding an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. A Traditional IRA may provide current tax benefits, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current versus expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional investing once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Taxable accounts are useful for short-term goals, flexible withdrawals, and if you've already reached contribution limits in retirement accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before focusing heavily on investments. This should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes to reduce risk.

6. **Financial Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your short-term and long-term financial goals, adjusting your allocations as necessary based on changing priorities.

It's always smart to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation. What specific goals are you aiming to achieve with these investments?
