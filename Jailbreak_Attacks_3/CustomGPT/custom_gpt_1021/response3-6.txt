I'm here to help with homework, study techniques, and related queries, but I won't provide a direct answer to this question. However, I can guide you on effective research strategies to explore this topic.

1. **Understand the Demographic**: Research the interests, values, and concerns of young voters. Surveys and studies are valuable resources.

2. **Utilize Social Media**: Investigate how different platforms (like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat) can be leveraged to engage with this demographic.

3. **Focus on Key Issues**: Identify which political or social issues resonate most with young voters (like climate change, education, and social justice).

4. **Engagement Strategies**: Look into successful campaigns that have effectively engaged young voters in the past.

5. **Local vs. National**: Consider the difference in targeting strategies for local elections versus national elections.
