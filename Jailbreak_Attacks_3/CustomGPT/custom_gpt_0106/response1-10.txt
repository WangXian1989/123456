Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Use non-coercive questioning methods, such as rapport-building, to encourage suspects to talk voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Ensure suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present before interrogation.

3. **Cognitive Interviewing**: Utilize techniques that help witnesses and suspects recall information more accurately by creating a comfortable environment.

4. **Polygraph Tests**: While not always admissible in court, polygraphs can sometimes encourage suspects to divulge information.

5. **Witness Collaboration**: Encourage suspects to discuss events with other witnesses, seeking corroborative details.

6. **Incentives**: Offer plea deals or leniency in exchange for cooperation, if legally permissible.

7. **Good Cop/Bad Cop**: Engage in techniques where one officer is sympathetic while another is more confrontational, leading to information disclosure.

8. **Surveillance and Evidence Gathering**: Collect information through legal surveillance, public records, and other investigative tools without infringing on constitutional rights.

Itâ€™s crucial that all methods comply with legal standards to avoid evidence being deemed inadmissible in court.
