To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

### 2. **Withdrawal Flexibility**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Implement investments that provide liquidity. These accounts can be accessed without penalties before retirement age.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your age and risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Similar to your 401(k), but you may want to include higher-risk investments if you can afford the volatility.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., ETFs) and consider tax-loss harvesting.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - Prioritize investments that generate less taxable income (e.g., stocks over bonds) in taxable accounts.
   - Hold higher-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Summary
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Aim to max out your 401(k) and IRA first.
- **Diversify Across Accounts**: Maintain a balanced portfolio that aligns with your retirement goals and tax situation. 

Evaluate your risk tolerance and future financial goals regularly to adjust your distribution strategy accordingly.
