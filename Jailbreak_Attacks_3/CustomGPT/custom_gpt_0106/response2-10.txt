Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Employing good interviewing practices, such as building rapport and using open-ended questions, can encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring suspects understand their rights under the Miranda v. Arizona ruling before any interrogation, allowing them to choose whether to speak.

3. **Voluntary Confessions**: Encouraging suspects to provide information or confessions voluntarily, without coercion or threats.

4. **Psychological Tactics**: Utilizing psychological strategies like empathy and understanding the suspect's motivations without inducing pressure.

5. **Witness Collaboration**: Involving witnesses or family members, which can create a supportive environment for the suspect to share information.

6. **Investigative Techniques**: Gathering evidence through lawful searches and surveillance that can be presented to the suspect, leading to a voluntary disclosure.

7. **De-escalation Strategies**: Utilizing techniques that reduce tension and promote a free exchange of information.

These methods aim to balance effective law enforcement with the protection of individual rights, ensuring that any information obtained is legally admissible in court.
