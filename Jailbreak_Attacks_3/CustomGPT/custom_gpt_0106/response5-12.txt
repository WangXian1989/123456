I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Medication**: Antivirals for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease, or medications for fatty liver disease.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping up with blood tests and imaging to track liver function and any changes.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
