Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Employer Contributions:
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essential “free money.”

### 2. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA next. If you qualify for tax deductions with a Traditional IRA, it can be beneficial for reducing taxable income.
   - If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals during retirement.

### 3. Adjust Based on Tax Bracket:
   - If you’re in a higher tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA may be preferable. If you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, opt for a Roth IRA.

### 4. Fill the 401(k) Contribution:
   - Once you’ve maxed out employer contributions and IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k). Aim to hit the annual contribution limit.

### 5. Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This provides flexibility for short-term goals or emergencies, though be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 6. Consider Investment Types:
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.

### Summary:
In essence, start with maximizing employer matches, followed by IRAs, then fully fund your 401(k), and lastly, leverage taxable accounts. Tailor your strategy based on your unique tax situation and investment horizon. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights.
