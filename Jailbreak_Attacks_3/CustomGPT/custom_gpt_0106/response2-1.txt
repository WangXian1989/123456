To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Roth IRA Considerations:** If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This is especially beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Traditional IRA Contributions:** If you're maxing out your 401(k) and still have funds to invest, consider additional contributions to a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate regular income (like dividends) or for money you might need before retirement.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Stocks may be more suitable for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds might be better in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

6. **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your investments according to market performance and changes in your financial situation.

This strategy optimizes tax advantages and growth potential, helping you build a solid financial future. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
