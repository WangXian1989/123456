When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Understand Account Types**: 
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income. Consider maxing this out first if you have a good employer match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, decide between a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or a Roth IRA (post-tax). Roths allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts offer more flexibility and liquidity but can incur capital gains taxes when you withdraw funds.

3. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**:
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like a Roth IRA) to minimize tax exposure.
   - Use taxable accounts for assets that generate taxable income (like bonds).

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that suits your unique financial situation.

The key is to align your investment strategy with your financial goals while considering tax implications and account benefits.
