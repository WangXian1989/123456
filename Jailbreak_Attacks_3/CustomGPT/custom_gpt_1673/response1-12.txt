I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for any liver problems. They can provide personalized treatment options based on the specific condition you're facing. Common treatment approaches may include lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet and exercise, medications, or in some cases, procedures to manage liver conditions. Please seek medical advice for accurate diagnosis and treatment.
