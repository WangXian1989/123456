To optimize your investment strategy and distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any company match. This is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a Traditional IRA to reduce your taxable income now.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After funding your retirement accounts, allocate excess funds to taxable accounts. This allows for more liquidity and can be ideal for short-term goals or investments.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selecting investments for these accounts.

**Additional Tips**:
- Evaluate your current tax bracket and future income expectations to determine the best mix of contributions.
- Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk.

Adjust your strategy as your financial situation changes or as you approach retirement. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
