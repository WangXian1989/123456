To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the maximum employer match. This is essentially free money and a great way to kickstart your retirement savings.

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, contribute to your IRA (especially if it offers tax deductions or benefits). Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This provides more flexibility for withdrawals and accessing funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Activities like bonds may be suitable in tax-advantaged accounts due to their lower tax efficiency, while more aggressive growth investments can work well in a taxable account.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, consider how you'll withdraw from these accounts. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Stay Informed**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in tax laws, investment performance, and your financial situation.
