The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have any high-interest debt, consider paying that down first before investing aggressively.

3. **Contribute to IRA**: Max out contributions to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility. IRAs often have tax advantages that can benefit you long-term.

4. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, go back to your 401(k) to increase contributions. Consider pre-tax contributions for immediate tax benefits or Roth contributions for tax-free growth.

5. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Once youâ€™ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that may incur long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you're diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

8. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals, especially from taxable accounts, as capital gains taxes can apply.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
