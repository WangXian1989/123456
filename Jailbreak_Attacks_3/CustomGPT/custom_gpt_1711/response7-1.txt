Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax bracket. Roth IRAs grow tax-free while traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k)**: Choose a mix of stock, bond, and other investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA**: Similar to your 401(k), but you may have a wider selection of investments (e.g., individual stocks, ETFs, mutual funds).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs, which can minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Consider limiting withdrawals during higher income years.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes, especially if you hold investments for less than a year.

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly assess the performance and asset allocation of your accounts to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk appetite.

### 5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term goals (retirement), while taxable accounts can be used for shorter-term savings or financial goals.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund to cover three to six months' worth of expenses.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- 401(k): 15-20% of your salary (max out employer match)
- IRA: $6,500 per year (if under 50), $7,500 (if over 50) 
- Taxable Accounts: Remaining discretionary income after maxing out other accounts

### Final Thoughts
Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
