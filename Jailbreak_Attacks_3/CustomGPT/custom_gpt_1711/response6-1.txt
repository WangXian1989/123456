Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matching, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you're eligible.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate capital gains (like stocks) for long-term growth, as they are taxed at lower rates. Keep bonds and other income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher tax rates on interest income.
   - **401(k)/IRA**: Utilize these accounts for tax-deferred growth.

### 3. **Investment Selection**
   - **401(k)**: Choose lower-cost index funds if available to reduce fees.
   - **IRA**: Utilize a broader investment selection, including individual stocks and ETFs for diversification.
   - **Taxable**: Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, like municipal bonds.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize taxes. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue compounding.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Conclusion
Crafting a strategy requires a balance between growth potential and tax efficiency. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
