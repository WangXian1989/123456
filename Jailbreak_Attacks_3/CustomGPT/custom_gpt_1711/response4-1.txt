To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive the full match, then consider maximizing contributions up to the annual limit.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, so consider this if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
  
3. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower short-term capital gains or for tax-efficient funds, such as index funds and ETFs.
   - **Bonds and High-Dividend Stocks**: These can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce tax burdens.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes to minimize risk.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and personal changes.

6. **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in your taxable accounts. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in a liquid account to avoid early withdrawals from retirement accounts.
