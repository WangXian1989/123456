Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax or Roth Options**: Consider whether you want to contribute on a pre-tax basis (traditional) or with after-tax dollars (Roth), depending on your current tax situation and expected future income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Contributions Limits**: Take advantage of IRAs for additional tax-advantaged savings. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Tax Diversification**: Consider having both a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA to provide flexibility in managing taxes in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for money you may need before retirement. This allows for greater access without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.

### Strategy Suggestion:
1. **Max out 401(k) contributions**, especially to receive any employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**, aiming for the annual maximum if possible.
3. Use any additional funds for a **taxable account**, especially for short-term goals.

### Additional Considerations:
- Regularly reassess your allocation based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal goals.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances. 

This balanced approach will help you build a well-rounded retirement portfolio while considering your tax implications and access to funds.
