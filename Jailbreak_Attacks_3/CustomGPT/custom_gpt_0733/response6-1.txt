Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves optimizing for factors like tax efficiency, investment growth, and your financial goals. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Focus on contributing the maximum allowable amount if possible, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA could be more beneficial.

### 2. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**
   - Reserve contributions to taxable accounts for after maximizing tax-advantaged options. Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, which can erode returns.
   - Use these accounts for investments that generate less taxable income, such as long-term investments that you plan to hold for several years.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and the time left until you need the money. More aggressive investments (stocks) might belong in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Diverse Investment Strategies**: Consider using a mix of equities, bonds, and other assets to balance risk and return.

### 4. **Review Regularly**
   - Monitor performance and adjust contributions or allocations as needed based on changes in income, life circumstances, or economic conditions.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies according to your specific financial situation and goals.
