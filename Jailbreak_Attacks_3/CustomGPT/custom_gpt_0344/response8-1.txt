Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. It's essentially free money.
   - **Invest for Growth**: Typically, 401(k)s have higher contribution limits and can be a good way to save for retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Consider Income Levels**: Depending on your income, you may be eligible for a deduction on a Traditional IRA or may benefit more from a Roth IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals, making them suitable for medium-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Investment Choices**: You can invest in a broader range of assets, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for short-term or emergency funds.
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Fund your 401(k) and IRA primarily for retirement savings, focusing on maximizing tax advantages.
3. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced investment strategy across all accounts, considering risk tolerance and time horizon.
4. **Review Periodically**: Regularly assess your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal circumstances.

### Final Note:
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy suited to your specific situation and to navigate tax implications effectively.
