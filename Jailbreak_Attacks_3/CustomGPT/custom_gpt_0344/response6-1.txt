Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **Tax Loss Harvesting**: Offset gains in taxable accounts with losses to minimize tax impacts.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts (stocks, equity funds).
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Hold more conservative investments (bonds, cash equivalents) in taxable accounts to avoid unnecessary taxes on withdrawals.

### Example Strategy
- **Contributions**: Max out 401(k) up to the employer match, then fund an IRA. Next, allocate remaining savings to a taxable account.
- **Asset Allocation**: Keep higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts. Use taxable accounts for more stable investments.

### Summary
- **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts** to enhance growth and reduce tax liabilities.
- **Balance your investment types** based on time horizons and tax implications for optimal long-term growth.
