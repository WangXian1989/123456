It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver issues. In general, treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** Maintaining a healthy diet low in fats and sugars, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications:** Depending on the specific liver condition (such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Supplements:** Certain supplements, like milk thistle, may support liver health, but you should discuss these with your doctor.

4. **Regular Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function can help in managing liver health effectively.

5. **Surgery or Procedures:** In severe cases, surgical options like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always follow a healthcare provider's recommendations tailored to your medical history and specific liver condition.
