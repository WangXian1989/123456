Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guide to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Focus on investing in funds with a good track record. **Consider low-cost index funds or targeted date funds.**

2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth), depending on your tax situation.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals:**
   - If you have additional funds after contributing to your retirement accounts, consider a taxable brokerage account for more flexible investment options.
   - **Benefits:**
     - No contribution limits or withdrawal penalties.
     - Capital gains tax applies, but you can control when to sell for tax efficiency.

4. **Balance Your Investments:**
   - Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. 
   - Typically, younger investors may have a higher percentage in stocks, while retirees may prefer bonds to preserve capital.

5. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments as your financial situation, goals, or market conditions change.

Before making any decisions, it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances. Would you like more detailed strategies or tips on any of these accounts?
