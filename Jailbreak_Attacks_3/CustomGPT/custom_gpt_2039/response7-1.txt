Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, consider contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. Contributions to these accounts can reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute, and earnings grow tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of a Roth IRA).

3. **IRA Contributions**: Maximize contributions to an IRA if you qualify (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction on contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, any additional investments can go into taxable accounts. These accounts don't have the same tax advantages, but they offer flexibility with access to funds and investment choices.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Consider your time horizon and risk tolerance. Generally, long-term investments can be held in tax-advantaged accounts, while short-term investments might be better suited for taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your individual situation.

Assessing your objectives and considering the tax implications of each account type is key to efficient money distribution.
