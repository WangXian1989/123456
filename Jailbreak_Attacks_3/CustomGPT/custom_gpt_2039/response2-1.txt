To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer matching contributions, if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - Contribute up to the annual limit if possible to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
   - Target investment options that align with your long-term goals, considering risk tolerance and time horizon.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth) Contributions**:
   - Determine whether a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA is more beneficial based on your current tax situation. A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.
   - Contribute the maximum allowable amount to benefit from tax advantages, especially in a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments beyond retirement accounts, focusing on goals with shorter time horizons or for emergency funds.
   - Be mindful of capital gains tax. Consider investing in low-turnover index funds or ETFs to minimize taxable events.
   - Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset capital gains with losses to decrease taxes owed.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts to spread risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your investment strategy.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to ensure it remains aligned with your financial goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an appropriate emergency fund outside of your investment accounts, typically covering 3-6 months' worth of living expenses.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're uncertain about the best strategy for your personal circumstances, consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.

Aim for a balanced approach based on your long-term objectives, tax considerations, and risk tolerance.
