Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some considerations to help guide your distribution strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, consider contributing at least enough to get the full match. This is effectively “free money.”
   - **Contribution Limits**: In 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 for individuals under 50 and $30,000 for those 50 and older.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Types of IRAs**: Consider whether a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA is better for you. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 for those under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and older.
   - **Income Limits**: Be aware of income limits, especially for contributing to a Roth IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for accessing your funds without penalties; however, you'll pay capital gains taxes on earnings.
   - **Investment Choices**: You can choose a wide range of investments, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Consider your risk tolerance and adjust your asset allocation accordingly. Younger investors typically can take more risks than those closer to retirement.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Order of Withdrawals**: Generally, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer. However, this can vary based on tax implications and individual financial situations.

6. **Periodic Review**:
   - **Reassess Your Strategy**: Review your investment strategy periodically or after significant life changes (like a job change, marriage, or having children) to ensure it aligns with your current goals.

It's often best to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the distribution of your money to your specific financial situation and retirement goals, ensuring you maximize growth potential while managing taxes effectively.
