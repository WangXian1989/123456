When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize your investment:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your current taxable income. Withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

3. **Contribution Limits:** 
   - For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). 
   - For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50 or older). Max out contributions based on your eligibility to minimize tax liability.

4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k):** Typically has a limited selection of investment options. Choose a diversified mix that aligns with your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** Offers more flexibility in investment choices. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA to benefit from tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for investments that you might want to withdraw before retirement (like stocks or funds). This account can also be good for tax-loss harvesting.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Rebalance as Needed:** Regularly assess your asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance them to maintain your desired risk profile.

7. **Long-Term Perspective:** Consider each account's timeline and specific goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.) to guide investment decisions.

It's advisable to regularly review your financial situation and consult with a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific needs and circumstances.
