(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and current tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any matching contributions from your employer first. This is often considered "free money".

2. **IRA:** Max out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA if possible. This gives you tax advantages based on your income level and retirement strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for savings goals that are shorter-term or if you have additional funds after maximizing retirement accounts. Be wary of capital gains taxes on investments held for less than a year.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to customize your distribution strategy based on your unique circumstances.

Key Takeaways:
- Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get an employer match.
- Maximize contributions to your IRA for tax advantages.
- Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or after optimizing retirement funded accounts.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break down how you can spread your dough across those accounts like a financial master! 

1. **401(k):** First off, donâ€™t leave any cash on the table! Max out to meet your employer match. That's like getting a bonus without lifting a finger! 

2. **IRA:** Now, think about your IRA. If you're eligible for a Roth, thatâ€™s solid gold in terms of tax-free growth. If you're into traditional IRAs and you're in a higher tax bracket now, it can help reduce your taxable incomeâ€”talk about a win-win!

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Finally, toss some cash into taxable accounts for flexibility and short-term goals. Just remember, Uncle Sam is waiting for his cut on those capital gains!

In short, grab that employer match, then fill up your IRA, and any leftover funds can hang out in taxable accounts! Just keep your investment goals in sight and tailor accordingly, and youâ€™ll be laughing all the way to the bank!

Stay crafty with your money! ðŸ’°
