### 1. Understanding Account Types
- **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan that often includes tax advantages such as pre-tax contributions and potential employer matching. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
  
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax-deferred growth. There are traditional IRAs (tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) and Roth IRAs (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals if conditions are met).
  
- **Taxable Accounts:** Funds are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains. More flexible for withdrawals but lacks the same tax advantages.

### 2. Asset Allocation
- **Determine Goals:** What do you want to achieveâ€”long-term growth, retirement, significant purchases?
  
- **Age and Risk Tolerance:** Younger investors can afford to take more risks, while those nearing retirement may prefer stability. A common suggestion for asset allocation is the 100 minus your age rule, which recommends how much to hold in stocks.

### 3. Distribution Strategy
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Initially prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then fund your IRA, and finally add to your taxable accounts.
  
- **Withdrawal Strategy:** In retirement, consider withdrawing from tax-deferred accounts first (401(k), traditional IRA), then from Roth accounts, and finally from taxable accounts to manage tax implications effectively.

### 4. Regularly Review and Adjust
- Reassess your distribution strategy annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.
