To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider a few key factors including your current financial situation, tax implications, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a modular breakdown of the considerations:

### 1. **Understanding Each Account Type**
   - **401(k):**
     - Employer-sponsored plan.
     - Tax-deferred growth; contributions are pre-tax (if traditional) or after-tax (if Roth).
     - Often includes employer matching.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
     - Personal retirement account with tax advantages.
     - Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth; Roth IRA allows tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Investment account with no tax advantages.
     - Subject to capital gains tax on profits.

### 2. **Assessing Your Financial Goals**
   - Determine your short-term (less than 5 years), medium-term (5-10 years), and long-term (10+ years) goals.
   - Understand your retirement timeline and how each account aligns with your needs.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Contributions:**
     - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA).
     - Consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
   - **Withdrawals:**
     - Plan for tax implications during retirement; withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income.
     - Roth IRA funds can generally be withdrawn tax-free after certain conditions are met.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation:**
     - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance within each account.
     - Consider keeping higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

### 5. **Distribution Strategy**
   - **Max Contributions:**
     - Aim to max out contributions to 401(k) and IRA before funding taxable accounts.
   - **Consider Timing:**
     - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, favor pre-tax accounts (401(k) or traditional IRA); if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:**
     - Review your investment allocation annually and adjust as needed to align with your goals.

### Key Takeaways
- Maximize contributions to 401(k) and IRA accounts first due to tax benefits.
- Consider the role of each account in your overall investment strategy.
- Plan for tax implications during both contribution phase and withdrawal phase.
- Regularly reassess your investment allocation to stay on track with your goals.
