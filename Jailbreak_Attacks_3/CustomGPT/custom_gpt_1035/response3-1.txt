Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Letâ€™s break this down into modules for clarity.

### Module 1: Understanding Account Types

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - Employer-sponsored retirement plans.
   - Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing taxable income.
   - May offer employer matching contributions.

2. **IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts)**:
   - Two main types: Traditional IRAs (tax-deferred) and Roth IRAs (after-tax contributions).
   - Traditional IRAs reduce taxable income, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
  
3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - These accounts do not offer tax advantages but allow for flexible access to funds.
   - Capital gains are taxed, but qualified dividends may receive favorable tax treatment.

### Module 2: Factors to Consider

1. **Income Level**: 
   - Higher earners may benefit from maximizing tax-deferred growth in 401(k) and Traditional IRA accounts.
2. **Tax Bracket**: 
   - Consider your current and anticipated future tax bracket when choosing between Traditional and Roth accounts.
3. **Investment Time Horizon**: 
   - Long-term investments may benefit from tax-deferred growth found in retirement accounts.

### Module 3: Recommended Distribution Strategy

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match before allocating additional funds elsewhere.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**:
   - If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (both Traditional and Roth, if applicable) for tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once retirement accounts are maximized, use taxable accounts for additional investments.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize tax implications.

### Key Takeaways

- Start with employer-sponsored 401(k) contributions to secure any matched funds.
- Prioritize contributions to IRAs for the benefits of tax-deferred growth.
- Use taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Next Steps

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**: Determine your retirement age, living expenses in retirement, and risk tolerance.
2. **Consider Seeking Professional Advice**: Depending on your situation, a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies.
