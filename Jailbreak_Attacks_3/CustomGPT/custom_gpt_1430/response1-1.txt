Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or after-tax investments, ideally for goals that are shorter-term.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you have a mix of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Remember that withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from Roth IRAs are tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes, so consider the timing of selling investments.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and rebalance to keep your risk level in check.

5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth and taxable accounts for short-term needs or for investing in assets that generate taxable income.
