I'm not a substitute for professional medical advice, but I can provide some general information about liver health. Treatment for liver problems can vary widely depending on the specific condition, but here are some common options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains can help. Avoid fatty, salty, and sugary foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver function and overall health.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver health.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Reducing exposure to chemicals and toxins can help protect the liver.

5. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol may require management to protect liver health.

For specific recommendations tailored to your situation, consult with a healthcare professional or a liver specialist.
