Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA can be beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investment flexibility and to hold assets that produce favorable capital gains or qualified dividends.

4. **Debt Consideration**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that off before investing heavily in your retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes to manage risk effectively.

6. **Withdrawals Planning**: Be mindful of how you anticipate withdrawing funds in retirement, as this can impact your strategy for how much to keep in each type of account.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For tailored advice, consider discussing your situation with a financial advisor.
