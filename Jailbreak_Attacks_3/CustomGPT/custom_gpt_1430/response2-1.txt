Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you're looking for more immediate access to funds or if you've already maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility with withdrawals but come with capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or real estate) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize your tax burden, while holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Balanced Diversification**: Regardless of the type of account, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) that align with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Adjust as Needed**: Review and adjust your distribution strategy annually based on changes in income, expenses, tax laws, and life circumstances.
