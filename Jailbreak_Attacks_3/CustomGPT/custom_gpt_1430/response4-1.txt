Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out contributions, especially if you have a high income, as contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a traditional IRA for tax deductions, or to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for shorter-term goals or after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility and no contribution limits, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Invest based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher growth investments in tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Rebalance Annually**: Check your allocation regularly and adjust as needed to stay aligned with your financial goals.
