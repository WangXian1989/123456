To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Max out contributions to your IRA (if eligible), focusing on the tax benefits of each type.

### 2. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA can be taxed as ordinary income. Roth IRA withdrawals are generally tax-free. Consider your future tax bracket when planning withdrawals.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where growth is tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Stable Investments**: Keep more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxable income.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Review and adjust your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

### Additional Considerations
- **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of yearly contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts.
- **Retirement Goals**: Align your distribution strategy with your retirement timeline and financial goals.

Implementing these strategies can lead to more efficient wealth accumulation and tax management.
