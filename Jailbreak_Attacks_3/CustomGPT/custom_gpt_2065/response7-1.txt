To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions lower your taxable income; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax benefits for traditional IRAs; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes; keep less tax-efficient investments like bonds in tax-advantaged accounts.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Aim for a balanced mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth potential investments.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) (especially if there's an employer match) and IRA before funding taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for when and how youâ€™ll withdraw from each account in retirement, considering tax implications. Generally, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, tax-free accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure alignment with your goals and market changes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide tailored advice considering your individual circumstances, tax situation, and long-term goals.

By strategically allocating your assets across these accounts, you can optimize growth and manage taxes effectively.
