To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Max out contributions if eligible. Traditional IRAs offer immediate tax benefits, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Retirement (Long-Term):** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on growth-oriented investments in these accounts.
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for investments with lower anticipated returns that you may need to access sooner.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Assessment:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Allocate based on your comfort with market fluctuations. Higher-risk investments can be placed in your tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-deferred growth.
   - **Asset Allocation:** Maintain a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets aligned with your financial objectives.

### Summary:
- **Maximize contributions** to tax-advantaged accounts first.
- **Diversify investments** according to risk tolerance and time horizon to optimize growth and minimize taxes.

This strategy allows for efficient growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
