Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a concise breakdown:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Contributions**: Max out any employer match first, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Focus on this if you're in a higher tax bracket now.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Like a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible. Consider this if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Prioritize funding these accounts, as they offer tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for investments you want to access before retirement, as they don’t have withdrawal penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains tax; consider holding investments for over a year for favorable long-term rates.

### General Strategy:
- **Balance Contributions**: Initially, focus on maxing out your 401(k) to capture employer matches, then contribute to your IRA.
- **Plan Withdrawals**: As you approach retirement, shift to taxable accounts if needed for liquidity, but aim to let tax-advantaged accounts grow.
- **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts to manage risk and return.

### Conclusion:
Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your unique situation and objectives.
