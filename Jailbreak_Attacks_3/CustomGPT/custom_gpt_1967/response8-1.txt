To optimize your money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Prioritize maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match first.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, making it a great option for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be more flexible since you can access funds anytime without penalties, but youâ€™ll pay capital gains tax on any profits when selling investments.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Hold higher-risk, higher-return investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce your tax burden on gains.
   - Keep more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: The longer you can keep your investments untouched, the more beneficial tax-advantaged accounts become, thanks to compounding.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can be invaluable to tailor strategies to your specific situation.

Balancing between these accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Always keep your long-term goals in mind!
