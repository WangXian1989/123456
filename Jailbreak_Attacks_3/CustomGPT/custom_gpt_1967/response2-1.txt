Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few key factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a clever breakdown to get you thinking critically about your strategy:

1. **Max Out Retirement Accounts First:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match—it's free money! After that, consider maxing out an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation).

2. **Consider Tax Implications:** 
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible, which is great for reducing your taxable income now, but you'll owe taxes on withdrawals later. This is better if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** You pay taxes on contributions now, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is ideal if you expect your tax rate to rise or if you want tax-free income streams in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are great for flexibility and liquidity. Just keep in mind that you'll pay capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell investments. 

3. **Balance Your Investments:** 
   - Consider holding less tax-efficient investments in tax-deferred accounts (like bonds or REITs) and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.
   - Diversify within each account type to mitigate risks and achieve your investment goals.

4. **Revisit Regularly:** Your financial situation, goals, and market conditions will change, so revisit your allocations regularly to ensure they still align with your strategy.

So, in short: start with maxing those tax-advantaged accounts, assess your tax situation, diversify, and don’t forget to keep an eye on it all. Planning ahead can yield some serious benefits down the line!
