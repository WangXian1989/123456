Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors like your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax bracket) before putting extra funds into taxable accounts. This can help lower your taxable income now or let your money grow tax-free for retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, aim for a balanced mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. 

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts. This might help reduce your overall tax burden.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Monitor your investments periodically and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Long-term Focus**: Keep in mind your long-term goals. Money in tax-advantaged accounts is generally meant for retirement, while taxable accounts provide more flexibility for other financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
