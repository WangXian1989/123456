I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information that might help you understand treatment options for liver problems. Itâ€™s essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet low in saturated fats and sugars, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), your doctor might prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Supplements**: Some people find liver supplements, such as milk thistle or Vitamin E, helpful, but it's crucial to discuss this with your doctor first.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: For chronic liver issues, regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function are important.

5. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver biopsy or transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
