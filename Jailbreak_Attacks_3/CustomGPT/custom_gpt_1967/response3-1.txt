When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to help optimize your distribution strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out your IRA (Roth or Traditional, depending on your tax situation). The tax benefits can significantly boost your long-term gains.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Allocate funds to your 401(k) if you are in a higher tax bracket, as it offers tax-deferred growth. If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, Traditional IRAs might be preferable. Conversely, Roth accounts can be beneficial if you expect to be in the same or higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Balance Between Accounts**: After addressing max contributions to your employer’s 401(k) and IRA, use taxable accounts for additional savings. These can provide more flexibility with withdrawals.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Financial situations and tax laws can change—review your asset allocation and contributions regularly to ensure they align with your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial planner who can tailor recommendations based on your specific circumstances.

Remember, these are guidelines; individual circumstances can vary greatly, so tailor your strategy to fit your unique needs.
