Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing your immediate investment goals, tax considerations, and retirement needs. Hereâ€™s a straightforward breakdown:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the match, focus on maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth), depending on your income and tax situation. If eligible, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you have additional funds after maxing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to its limit. This allows for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you hit the contribution limits (for 401(k) and IRA), you can begin investing in taxable accounts. Here, consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts. Adjust your allocations based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your portfolio at least annually to maintain your desired asset allocation and adapt to any changes in your financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also tailor this approach to your specific situation.
