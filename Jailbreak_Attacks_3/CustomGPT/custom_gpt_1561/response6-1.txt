Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your specific financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute the maximum to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Taxable Account Considerations**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds or ETFs, which have lower turnover and capital gains taxes.
   - Consider keeping more aggressive or higher yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to take advantage of their tax benefits.

3. **Balance Your Risk**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts, ensuring you account for risk tolerance and investment strategy. This helps mitigate risk more effectively.

4. **Age and Retirement Timing**:
   - Keep in mind your age and when you plan to retire. Younger investors may prioritize growth accounts, while those nearing retirement might focus on preservation.

It's always beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that suits your unique circumstances.
