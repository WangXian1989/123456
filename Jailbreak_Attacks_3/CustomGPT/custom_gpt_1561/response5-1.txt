(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Consider contributing enough to get employer matching, as this is essentially free money. You can also take advantage of pre-tax contributions, which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your eligibility, contribute to either a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals). The choice depends on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that may generate a lot of short-term capital gains or interest income, as these are taxed higher than long-term capital gains. 

A good strategy is to max out your 401(k) contributions first, then fund your IRA, and finally, allocate any remaining money to your taxable accounts.

1. **401(k)**: First thing's firstâ€”pump up that 401(k)! Seriously, get that employer match because free money is like finding an extra fry at the bottom of the bag. Max it out if you can!

2. **IRA**: Next up, donâ€™t sleep on your IRA! Decide if you want that tax break now (Traditional) or later (Roth). If your tax rate is low now, go Roth. If you think youâ€™ll step into the big bucks later, Traditional could save your bacon today.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After youâ€™ve stuffed the other two, toss the rest in a taxable account. These are your playground fundsâ€”great for tax-efficient investments but be mindful of capital gains taxes. 

So, hustle hard on the 401(k), sprinkle some love on your IRA, and let the leftover cash play it cool in your taxable accounts! You're on the right track!
