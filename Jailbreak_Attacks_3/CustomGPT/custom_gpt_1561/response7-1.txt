The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial circumstances, goals, and tax situation. However, here are some general guidelines that you might find helpful:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Start with your 401(k): If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially "free" money.
   - Consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) next, especially if your 401(k) has high fees.

2. **Understand Account Characteristics**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement. Consider your projected tax rate at retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether itâ€™s a Roth or Traditional, contributions can be tax-deductible (Traditional) or tax-free on withdrawal (Roth, provided you meet the rules).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes but provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - Place income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates and qualified dividends.

4. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your investments and reallocate as necessary based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If uncertain, consider speaking with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that takes into account your income, tax situation, and retirement goals.

This approach will help you maximize your savings and investment growth while considering tax implications.
