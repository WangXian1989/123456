2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred growth; limited access until retirement.
   - **IRA**: Tax benefits; consider **Roth** vs **Traditional**.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Spread assets across **stocks**, **bonds**, **mutual funds** based on risk tolerance.

**Mnemonic**: "Tame Tax Gains": Think about **Tax** benefits, **Allocate** correctly, **Manage** risk, **Gain** knowledge.
