I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. The best treatment often depends on the specific liver problem you have. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid processed foods and limit alcohol.
   - **Weight Management**: Lose weight if you're overweight, as this can improve liver health.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy liver.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like Hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: For chronic liver diseases, regular check-ups and blood tests are essential to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, options like liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Avoid Toxins**: Limit exposure to harmful substances, including alcohol and certain medications.

Always seek advice from a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
