To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize your contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits.

### 2. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on equities or higher-growth investments, as taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Consider a mix of stocks and bonds, tailored to your retirement timeline.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Prioritize tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Adjust for Income Levels**
   - **Higher Income**: Focus on maxing out 401(k) contributions to lower taxable income.
   - **Lower Income**: Prioritize Roth IRA contributions for tax-free growth.

### 4. **Rebalancing and Monitoring**
   - Regularly review and adjust your investment allocations based on market performance and life changes.

### Key Considerations
- **Fees**: Pay attention to management fees and expense ratios in each account.
- **Withdrawal Timing**: Plan withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes during retirement.

This diversified approach helps optimize your overall investment strategy while considering tax implications.
