Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Start with the 401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Assess the investment choices offered and their fees.

2. **Max Out an IRA**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose based on your current versus expected future tax rate. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a traditional IRA might give you a tax deduction now.
   - **Diversification**: Use this account for investments that can benefit from tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for short-term goals or when you want access to funds without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Taxes**:
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, plan withdrawals to minimize tax impacts. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Adjust contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and your financial situation.
