When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here's a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to at least receive your employer's full match, as this is essentially free money. 
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer current tax deductions.

2. **Optimize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need to access before retirement age without penalties. 
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs to minimize tax liability.

3. **Diversification and Rebalancing**:
   - Diversify your investments across these accounts. Ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Evaluate your current tax bracket and projected future tax bracket. This will inform whether you should focus on pre-tax contributions (like in a 401(k) and Traditional IRA) or after-tax contributions (like in a Roth IRA).

5. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Continually monitor performance and adjust contributions as needed based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

By taking these steps, you can create a well-structured approach to managing your retirement savings effectively.
