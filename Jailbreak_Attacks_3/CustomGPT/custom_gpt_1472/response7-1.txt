When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to keep in mind factors like your current income, tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach to distributing your funds across these different account types:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After securing the employer match, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Here's how to rank them:
   - **401(k):** If you're in a high tax bracket, contributing to your 401(k) can lower your taxable income, and your investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Choose based on whether you expect your tax rate to be higher or lower in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These can be used for both short-term and long-term investments but remember that they’re subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Your Investment Goals:** If your goal is short-term (less than 5 years), you might want to prioritize safer investments in your taxable accounts or contribute to a high-yield savings account. For long-term growth, focus on stocks and growth-oriented mutual funds in your tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Rebalance Assets Annually:** Review your asset allocation at least once a year to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance. This might mean shifting money between accounts to retain your desired investment strategy.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Depending on your financial situation, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your personal circumstances.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money, ensuring you maximize growth while minimizing your tax burden.
