Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k):** Maximize employer contributions first if you have access to a 401(k) with matching contributions. This is essentially free money. Aim to contribute enough to receive the full match, typically 3% to 6% of your salary.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After optimizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA. If you qualify, a Roth IRA can be beneficial as withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. For traditional IRAs, contributions may be tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating additional funds to taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility with withdrawals but may be subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

### Considerations:
- **Time Horizon:** If you’re saving for retirement that’s several decades away, focus more on tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, taxable accounts might offer better flexibility.
- **Tax Bracket:** Pay attention to your current and expected future tax bracket. This influences whether Traditional or Roth accounts are more beneficial.
- **Investment Strategy:** Diversify your investments to balance risk and return across all account types.

### General Strategy:
1. **Max out 401(k) contributions, up to the match.**
2. **Contribute to an IRA to the limit.**
3. **Invest in taxable accounts as needed for additional flexibility.**
