When considering the best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to take into account several factors, including your current tax situation, retirement goals, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here's a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and can enhance your retirement savings significantly.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you need an immediate tax deduction, a Traditional IRA may be more suitable.

### 2. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Impact:**
   - **Tax Efficiency:** After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider your taxable accounts for additional investments. In taxable accounts, invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds and ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Asset Allocation:** Place higher-growth investments, which may generate more taxable events, in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping income-generating investments in taxable accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

### 3. **Long-Term Strategy:**
   - **Time Horizon:** If you are younger and have a long investment horizon, you may want to focus on aggressive growth in your 401(k) and IRA, while using taxable accounts for more liquid, diversified investments.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan for how and when you’ll withdraw from each account type in retirement, as this will influence your strategy on how much to allocate to each.

### Example Allocation Framework:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your total investment contributions
- **IRA (Roth/Traditional):** 10-15%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 5-10%, adjusting for liquidity and immediate needs

### Key Considerations:
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Tailor your strategy to your individual financial situation, goals, and the specific investment options available in your accounts.
- **Review and Adjust:** Regularly assess your investments and contributions as your financial situation evolves. 

This multi-faceted strategy can help optimize your money’s growth potential while considering tax implications and your long-term financial goals.
