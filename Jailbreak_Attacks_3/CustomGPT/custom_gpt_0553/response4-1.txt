Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money," and it's a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. Assess your current tax rate and expected retirement tax rate to evaluate how much to contribute here.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRA contributions may also be tax-deductible. Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not offer tax advantages for contributions but provide flexibility for withdrawals. Consider holding investments suitable for long-term growth, as long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure a mix of assets aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Stocks may yield higher returns but come with more risk, while bonds typically offer stability.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing in retirement accounts, ensure you have sufficient savings in an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months' worth of living expenses) to cover unforeseen expenses without tapping into your investment accounts.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Your age and comfort with risk will influence where to allocate your money. Younger investors might allocate more to stocks within their 401(k) and IRA for growth, while older investors nearing retirement might shift toward more conservative investments.

6. **Periodic Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on market performance and changes in your financial situation to ensure alignment with your overall goals.

In summary, a balanced approach that maximizes tax advantages while considering your investment strategy and financial goals is often the best way to distribute your funds. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your unique circumstances.
