Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations and strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk. This may involve allocating your investments in stocks, bonds, or other assets differently in each account based on tax efficiency. 

3. **Asset Location**:
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, as they generate lower capital gains taxes.
   - Use tax-inefficient investments (like actively managed funds or bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) where taxes on income and gains are deferred.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy** (for the future):
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it’s better to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your allocation to ensure it meets your financial goals and adjust as necessary based on performance and changes in your life circumstances.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors may prioritize growth investments, while those closer to retirement might focus on preserving capital. Adjust allocations based on your risk tolerance.
