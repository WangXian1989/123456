I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that it would be best to consult a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific liver problem. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the condition, so a thorough evaluation is essential. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications to manage specific conditions, or in some cases, more advanced treatments. Always seek professional medical advice for health concerns.
