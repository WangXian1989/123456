To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Begin by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term investment growth. If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to receive the full match before considering other allocations.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: If you have a 401(k), prioritize contributions up to the employer match, as this is essentially “free money.” After reaching this threshold, evaluate your investment options within the 401(k) to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

3. **Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, determine if a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed withdrawals) or Roth IRA (taxed contributions, tax-free withdrawals) suits you better. Maximize the IRA contributions ($6,500 for individuals under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and older for the year 2023).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After utilizing tax-advantaged accounts, any additional savings can be directed to taxable accounts. Keep in mind that investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes. Consider long-term investments and tax-efficient funds to minimize tax liability in these accounts.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and rebalance periodically to align with your investment strategy. 

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: When planning your distribution, think about how you will withdraw funds during retirement. Balancing taxable and tax-deferred accounts can influence your tax bracket in retirement.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice and a strategy tailored to your financial situation, consider consulting a certified financial planner.

By implementing these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes your investment growth while minimizing tax implications.
