Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on maxing out contributions to these accounts first, as they offer tax benefits.
     - 401(k) limits for 2024: $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50+).
     - IRA limits for 2024: $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+).

### 3. **Consider Tax Diversification**
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 4. **Balance Between Accounts**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to your taxable account for flexibility.

### 5. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Reevaluate Regularly**
   - Review your allocation annually to adjust based on changes in income, investment goals, and tax laws.

### Conclusion
Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
