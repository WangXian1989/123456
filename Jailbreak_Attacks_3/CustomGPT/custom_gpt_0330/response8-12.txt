I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver issues. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are common strategies:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid fatty, sugary, and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), certain medications may be prescribed.

3. **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up blood tests to monitor liver function and any changes in condition.

5. **Hydration**: Keeping well-hydrated can support liver function.

6. **Supplements**: Some patients find benefits from supplements like milk thistle, but discuss this with your doctor first.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
