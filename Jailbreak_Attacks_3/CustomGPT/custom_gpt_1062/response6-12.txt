I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; reduce alcohol intake.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver function and overall health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis, medications like interferon or direct-acting antivirals may be used.
   - **Anti-inflammatory Medications**: To reduce inflammation in liver diseases, if prescribed.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - **Liver Biopsy**: To determine the extent of liver damage.
   - **Transplantation**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment.
