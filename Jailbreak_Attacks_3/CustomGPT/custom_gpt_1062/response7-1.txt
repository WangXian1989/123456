To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains, like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs. Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Balance your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Ensure you're not overexposed in one account.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation. This is especially important as market fluctuations can impact the proportions.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside these accounts to avoid withdrawing early from retirement accounts.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - Consider how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly from tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

Following these principles will help optimize your investment strategy for both growth and tax efficiency. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
