When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. This can provide tax advantages for your retirement savings.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After funding your IRA, go back and maximize your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit. The tax-deferred growth can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you still have additional funds after maxing out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for flexibility. These can be useful for shorter-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Keep in mind that tax-efficient investments, like index funds, work well in taxable accounts, while you might hold bonds or high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.

By prioritizing contributions this way, you can maximize your retirement savings while being mindful of tax implications.
