To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - *Income Tax Bracket*: Higher income may lead you to prioritize tax-deferred accounts to lower immediate taxable income.
   - *Future Expectations*: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, favor Roth options (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)).

### 3. **Emergency Fund & Short-Term Goals**
   - Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund separate from your investment accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term savings or goals, as they offer more access without penalties.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Choose a diversified mix of funds; often lower fees due to institutional pricing.
   - **IRA**: Broader investment options; consider more aggressive growth strategies for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize taxable events.

### Conclusion
Allocate contributions based on your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Regularly review and adjust your strategy to align with changing circumstances and market conditions.
