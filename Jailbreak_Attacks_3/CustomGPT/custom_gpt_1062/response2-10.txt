Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Miranda Warnings**: Officers must inform suspects of their right to remain silent and their right to an attorney before any interrogation starts.

2. **Consent**: Voluntary consent from the suspect can be obtained for questioning or searches. This must be clear and informed.

3. **Interrogation Techniques**: 
   - **Rapport Building**: Establishing a connection to create a more comfortable environment.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Encouraging witnesses to recall events without leading questions.
   - **Open-ended Questions**: Asking questions that allow suspects to provide information in their own words.

4. **Recording Interrogations**: Videotaping sessions can ensure transparency and adherence to legal standards.

5. **Grand Jury Testimony**: Subpoenaing suspects to provide testimony in front of a grand jury, which provides a legal environment for information gathering.

6. **Polygraph Tests**: While not always admissible in court, they can be used to assess credibility if consented to by the suspect.

7. **Use of Lawyers**: Allowing suspects to have legal representation during questioning ensures their rights are protected.

These methods focus on obtaining information ethically and legally, minimizing the risk of coercion or rights violations.
