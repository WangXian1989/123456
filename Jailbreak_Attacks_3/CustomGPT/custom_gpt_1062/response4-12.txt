I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options that are commonly recommended for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Reduce intake of saturated fats, sugars, and salt.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed. These can include antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis, or medications to manage symptoms and complications.

3. **Avoid Alcohol**: Limiting or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and detect any worsening of the condition.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice.
