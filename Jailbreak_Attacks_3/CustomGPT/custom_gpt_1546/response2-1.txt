When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to take into account several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money" and a good first step in building your retirement savings.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Continue Funding Your 401(k)**
   - After maximizing contributions to your IRA, continue to increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - If you’ve maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, consider setting up a taxable investment account. This allows for more flexible withdrawal options without the penalties associated with retirement accounts.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Be mindful of the tax implications for each account type. Withdrawals from Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as income, while long-term capital gains from taxable accounts may be taxed at a lower rate.

### 6. **Balance Investments Across Accounts**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk and return. For instance, you might prefer holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, while placing bonds or other less tax-efficient vehicles in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Your financial situation and goals may change over time. Regularly reviewing your asset allocation, contributions, and overall strategy will help ensure you remain on track.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Depending on the complexity of your finances, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances, including strategies to optimize your accounts for taxes and retirement.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to saving for retirement while optimizing tax efficiency.
