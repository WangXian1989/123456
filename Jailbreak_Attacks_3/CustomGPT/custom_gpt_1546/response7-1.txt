To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), ensure that you're contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Contribute to a 401(k) First**: After securing the match, focus on maxing out your 401(k) contributions. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're age 50 or older). If you have a high income, you might benefit from the tax deferral offered by a 401(k).

3. **Consider an IRA**: Next, contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation). The contribution limit for an IRA is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older) for 2023. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings**: Once you have maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts do not have the same restrictions as retirement accounts, providing flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Diversification of Investments**: Within each account type, aim for a diversified portfolio that balances stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be aware of tax implications regarding capital gains and withdrawals. Generally, it is beneficial to hold investments that generate higher taxes (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.

7. **Regular Review and Adjustments**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your savings and investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to build a solid financial future. It's also wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your approach to your specific situation.
