When considering the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to understand the specific features and benefits of each account type. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maximizing contributions if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Traditional IRAs may provide current tax benefits, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Balance Taxable Investment Accounts**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate higher taxable income, such as stocks with low turnover or tax-efficient index funds.
   - Keep an adequate emergency fund in cash or similar liquid assets that can be accessed without penalties.

### Key Considerations:
- **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in your taxable accounts. Long-term investments can be more tax-efficient.
- **Investment Goals**: Consider your time horizon and risk tolerance. Short-term goals may be better suited for more liquid, less volatile options.

Ultimately, the best strategy involves a tailored approach based on your financial goals, current income, tax bracket, and retirement timeline. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights.
