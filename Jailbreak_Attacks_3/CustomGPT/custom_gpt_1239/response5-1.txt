Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of employer matches and tax deferral, then focus on IRA contributions for additional tax benefits. Use taxable accounts for investments you'll need access to before retirement. Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific needs.
