To optimize your investment strategy among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out your IRA contributions before increasing 401(k) contributions, especially if your IRA has a lower expense ratio.
3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the short term, ensuring you have an emergency fund.
4. **Diversification**: Allocate assets based on your risk tolerance across all accounts, considering tax implications for each.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
