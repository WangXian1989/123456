The best distribution depends on factors like your retirement goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Generally, consider these guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer matches first; contribute enough to get the full match.
2. **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Contribute here if you need tax diversification.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term goals or investments you may need to access before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains.

A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specifics. Would you like assistance with anything else?
