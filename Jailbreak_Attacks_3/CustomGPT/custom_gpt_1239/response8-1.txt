The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maxing out the employer match, consider maximizing your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA which offers tax-free growth.

3. **Consider Tax Considerations**: Use taxable accounts for money you may need in the short term or that will have favorable capital gains treatment. 

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across accounts are diversified to balance risk and return.

5. **Rebalance as Necessary**: Regularly check your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also a good idea for personalized advice.
