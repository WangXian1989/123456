Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
- **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

### 2. Balance Contributions
- **401(k)**: Aim for contributing around 15% of your income if possible, especially if you haven't reached the employer match limit.
- **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider putting additional funds into your IRA, either traditional or Roth depending on your tax bracket and future expectations.

### 3. Consider Tax Impact
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need in the short term or want to invest in assets that might generate taxed income (like dividends). They can be a good place for taxable investments, keeping capital gains implications in mind.

### 4. Reassess Based on Goals
- **Short-Term Savings**: Prioritize taxable accounts for funds you might need within five years.
- **Long-Term Growth**: Lean more towards 401(k) and IRAs for retirement savings, focusing on growth.

### 5. Monitor and Adjust
- Revisit your allocations annually or as your financial situation changes. Adjust contributions based on performance, fees, and changing goals.

### Conclusion
A diversified approach leveraging all three account types can maximize growth potential while considering your tax situation. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can also be beneficial.
