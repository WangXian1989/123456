When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is essentially free money and a solid first step.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while a traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you may need access to before retirement, as withdrawals from retirement accounts may incur penalties. They are also good for holding investments that generate lower taxes, like long-term capital gains or qualified dividends.

### Asset Allocation
- **401(k)**: Focus on a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
- **IRA**: Choose investments that align with your retirement strategy; consider index funds or ETFs for lower fees.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of tax efficiencyâ€”invest in index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains distributions.

### Withdrawal Strategy
In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

Always consult a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.
