Distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Then consider maximizing contributions if possible (the limit for 2023 is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA (contribution limit is $6,500 per year, or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs allow tax deductions in the contribution year.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Tax Bracket**: If you’re in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial since you'd pay taxes on your contributions at a lower rate. Conversely, if you're expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) could save you money on taxes now.
   - **Long-Term Investments in Taxable Accounts**: For money you plan to invest long-term, consider keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds or stocks) in taxable accounts, as capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient cash or liquid assets in your taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies. This may include keeping a portion of your investments in easily accessible cash or money market accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain an emergency fund outside your retirement accounts, typically in a high-yield savings account, equivalent to three to six months' worth of expenses.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) to manage risk. Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations as needed based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and personal goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about the best strategy for your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice.

This structured approach helps ensure you’re taking advantage of the tax benefits offered by retirement accounts while also maintaining flexibility with your investments.
