To optimize the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
     - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is effectively free money.
     - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
  
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate more capital gains than interest income, such as stocks, to minimize tax impacts.

### 2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:**
     - Allocate more aggressive investments like stocks in long-term accounts (401(k) and IRA) where growth is prioritized, while using safer investments like bonds in taxable accounts to minimize annual tax liabilities.
  
   - **Diversification:** Ensure your overall portfolio includes a mix of asset classes (equities, fixed income, alternatives) proportionate to your risk tolerance.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - **Plan for Withdrawals:** Strategically plan withdrawals to minimize tax impacts. In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 4. **Contribution Limits:**
   - **Be Aware of Limits:** Ensure your contributions stay within annual limits set by the IRS for 401(k)s and IRAs to avoid penalties.

### Conclusion:
By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts for growth, maintaining a balanced and diversified portfolio, and planning future withdrawals strategically, you can optimize your overall investment strategy effectively. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific financial situation.
