The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here's a breakdown of strategies for optimal allocation:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often has employer matching, pre-tax contributions, and potentially higher contribution limits. Suitable for long-term growth with tax advantages.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Provides tax-deferred or tax-free growth, depending on the type. Contributes to retirement savings.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible for withdrawals at any time, but subject to capital gains taxes. Good for short-term goals or as an emergency fund.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers matching funds first, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Contribute to an IRA next, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA and meet the income requirements.
   - Lastly, allocate funds to a taxable account as needed.

### 3. **Factor in Your Tax Situation:**
   - **High-Income Years:** Focus on tax-deferred options (401(k) or Traditional IRA) to lower taxable income.
   - **Lower-Income Years:** Consider Roth IRA contributions for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Keep growth-oriented investments like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on capital gains.
   - Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 5. **Diversify:**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk and optimize returns over time.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Reassess your financial situation and investment goals annually or when significant life changes occur to ensure your distribution strategy remains aligned with your objectives.

### Conclusion:
Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) for employer matching, then fund your IRA based on your income situation, and lastly, allocate additional savings to taxable accounts. This balanced approach will help maximize your investment growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
