When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to align your approach with your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Goal:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Tax Benefits:** Depending on your income, consider contributing to a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Limits:** Ensure youâ€™re aware of annual contribution limits (e.g., $6,500 for IRAs in 2023, or $7,500 if age 50 or over).

### 3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**
   - **Beyond Match:** After receiving the full employer match, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions (up to $22,500 in 2023, or $30,000 if age 50 or over).
   - **Tax Deferral:** Contributions reduce your taxable income, leading to potential tax savings.

### 4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexible Access:** Use taxable accounts for investing beyond retirement accounts. This may be beneficial for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxes on capital gains.

### 5. **Debt Considerations**
   - **Pay Down High-Interest Debt:** If you have high-interest debt (e.g., credit cards), consider prioritizing paying it down before aggressively funding retirement accounts.

### 6. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - **Spread Risk:** Diversify your investments across different asset classes tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 7. **Reassessment Over Time**
   - **Adjust Contributions:** Regularly review and adjust your contributions and investments based on changes in income, financial goals, or market conditions.

### Example Distribution Plan:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to max out employer match, then consider maxing contributions.
- **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA.
- **Taxable:** Use for additional investments, particularly if you've reached your retirement account limits.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, everyone's situation is unique, so it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan that considers your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
