Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: The 401(k) has higher contribution limits than IRAs, so consider maxing out if possible (for 2023, it's $22,500, or $30,000 if you're over 50).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: These accounts don’t have contribution limits, and you can withdraw funds anytime without penalties. They are best for short-term goals or if you need liquidity.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) here to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Ensure your total portfolio across these accounts is diversified—consider stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment allocations and adjust as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your unique circumstances.

By blending these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to managing your retirement savings and investments effectively.
