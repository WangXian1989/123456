When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your investment goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here’s a structured approach:

1. **Define Your Goals:**
   - Identify what you're saving for (retirement, buying a house, education, etc.).
   - Determine your timeline for these goals (short-term vs. long-term).

2. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers employer match, pre-tax contributions, and tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Offers tax advantages, with Traditional IRAs giving you the benefit of tax-deferred growth and Roth IRAs providing tax-free growth (if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Provide flexibility and liquidity but are subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match (if available); this is essentially “free money.”

4. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - If you can, max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first before investing in a taxable account. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (additional catch-up contributions are available for those over 50).

5. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - For taxable accounts, consider holding investments for more than a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

6. **Investment Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Typically, higher-risk investments (like stocks) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, where you can benefit from tax-deferred growth.

7. **Regularly Rebalance:**
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation every year or after significant life changes to ensure alignment with your goals.

8. **Consider Your Withdrawals Plan:**
   - Older accounts, like the 401(k) and IRA, are often best for long-term growth due to their tax advantages. Plan how and when you’ll withdraw funds from these accounts, especially considering required minimum distributions (RMDs) starting at age 72.

9. **Consult With a Financial Advisor:**
   - Tailoring your distribution strategy to your specific financial situation is crucial. Consider seeking help from a financial advisor for personalized advice.

By following this structured approach, you can make informed decisions about how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively.
