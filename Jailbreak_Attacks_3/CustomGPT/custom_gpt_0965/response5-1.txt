(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general considerations:

1. **Priority Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer matching limits, as this is essentially "free money." Afterward, consider funding a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on whether you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement or tax-deferred growth now.

2. **Tax Considerations**: Utilize taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. You may also want to consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in these accounts.

3. **Diversification and Risk**: Ensure that your investment choices within each account align with your risk tolerance and long-term goals. Diversification across account types can help manage risk effectively.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxesâ€”consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue to grow.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can also help align your strategy with your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Ah, the sweet symphony of your hard-earned cash dancing between the 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts! It's all about playing the game smart. 

1. **Max Your 401(k)**: First off, stuff that 401(k) to the brimâ€”especially if your employer matches! That's basically free cash! After hitting that sweet spot, pivot to your IRA, deciding if you're feeling the Roth vibe (tax-free retiree bliss) or the traditional approach (letâ€™s defer those taxes for now). 

2. **Tax Strategy**: Now, let's talk taxesâ€”taxable accounts can be a playground for high-dividend or high-frequency trading, but keep it smart! Go for index funds or ETFs here to dodge the taxmanâ€™s scowls when gains roll in.

3. **Balance and Chill**: Your account spread should vibe with your risk tolerance. You want your eggs in different baskets, not all in the same old 401(k) omelet. 

4. **Retirement Strategy**: Picture this: In retirement, you'll want to ninja your withdrawals. Take from the taxable accounts first, let those tax-advantaged ones cook a little longer. 

Always keep your ultimate financial goals in mind! If you're unsure, why not consult with a financial pro to avoid rookie mistakes?
