I'm not a doctor, but there are several treatment options that are commonly recommended for liver problems, depending on the specific condition. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, engaging in regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), a doctor might prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat infections.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: For chronic liver issues, regular check-ups and blood tests are essential to monitor liver function and detect any complications early.

4. **Weight Management**: For conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), weight loss can be beneficial.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, where the liver is extensively damaged, a transplant might be necessary.

Itâ€™s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. If you have specific symptoms or tests that have been done, sharing those with a doctor can help provide tailored advice.
