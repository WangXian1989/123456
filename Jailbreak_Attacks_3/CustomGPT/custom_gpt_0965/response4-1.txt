It's great that you're considering how to allocate your funds wisely across different types of investment accounts. Here are some general guidelines to help you distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money. If you can afford it, aim to max out your contributions.
   - **IRA:** If you have the option, consider contributing to both a traditional and a Roth IRA. The traditional IRA may offer immediate tax benefits, while the Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - Taxable accounts do not offer the same tax advantages as 401(k)s and IRAs, but they provide more flexibility. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, you might prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) over taxable accounts early on.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account, ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.). This reduces risk and can enhance returns over the long term.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - As you contribute to these accounts and as market conditions change, periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund. This fund should cover 3-6 months' worth of living expenses and should be kept in a liquid, accessible account.

6. **Long-Term Goals:**
   - Align your investment strategy with your long-term financial goals, considering timelines for retirement and other major expenditures.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you're still unsure about how best to distribute your money, consider consulting with a financial advisor. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced investment strategy that optimizes your tax situation and prepares you for your long-term financial goals.
