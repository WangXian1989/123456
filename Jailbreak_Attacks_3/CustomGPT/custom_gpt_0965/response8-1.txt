When considering the best way to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to factor in various elements such as tax implications, investment goals, time horizon, and emergency savings. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt Repayment:** If you have any high-interest debt, it may be wise to pay that down before investing, as the interest on debt can outpace potential investment returns.

3. **Contribute to IRA or Roth IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on whether you think your tax rate will be higher or lower in retirement compared to now.

4. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** If you have the means, consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) (up to the annual limit) after your IRA contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Any additional savings beyond retirement accounts can be invested in a taxable account. This provides more flexibility with withdrawals and may help with short-term goals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

6. **Investment Allocation:** Diversify your investments between stocks, bonds, and other assets, considering your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Generally, longer time horizons can afford more aggressive investments.

7. **Review Tax Efficiency:** Pay attention to which investments to keep in taxable versus tax-deferred accounts. For example, placing tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts can be beneficial.

8. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have a solid emergency fund in place (typically 3-6 months of expenses) before making significant investments.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.

It's always prudent to periodically review your allocation as your financial situation and goals may change over time.
