Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA Contributions**: If you’re eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **401(k) Contributions**: After taking advantage of any employer match, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions next. The contribution limits are generally higher than those for IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility, although you will pay taxes on dividends and interest.

4. **Consider Investment Goals and Timeline**:
   - Long-term goals (like retirement) can benefit more from tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Shorter-term goals might be better suited to taxable accounts for easier access.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your investments and rebalance as needed to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor. They can help tailor a strategy based on your unique situation.

This approach can help you maximize growth while minimizing taxes over time.
