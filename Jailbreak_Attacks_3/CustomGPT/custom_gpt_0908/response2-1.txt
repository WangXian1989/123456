Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Consider maxing this out if you benefit from tax deductions.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible or grow tax-free. If you’re eligible for a Roth, it can be advantageous for long-term growth.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, start investing in taxable accounts. This offers flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices, although you’ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure broad diversification across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts. Balance your portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient ones (like stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in case of emergencies before focusing entirely on long-term investments.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific situation.
