Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Max out contributions if feasible, especially if you are in a high tax bracket, since contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals—both contributions and earnings—are tax-free. If you anticipate being in a lower bracket, a traditional IRA may be beneficial. Aim to maximize annual contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for more flexible investment opportunities and short-term goals. Since capital gains taxes apply here, consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates. This account can also be useful for investing in assets that may not be suitable for tax-advantaged accounts.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Employer Match in 401(k):** First priority.
- **Maximize IRA Contributions:** Once you’re hitting your employer match, direct funds to your IRA.
- **Additional Contributions to 401(k):** If you still have room after IRA contributions.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out, allocate surplus funds here for flexibility.

### Considerations:
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
- Reassess your distribution annually based on performance and changes in tax laws.

This approach balances tax efficiency and liquidity to help you meet your financial goals.
