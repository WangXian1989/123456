Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may provide tax deductions.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've maxed out the IRA contributions, increase your 401(k) contributions further, especially if you have a high income and anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement. They offer more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure youâ€™re diversifying your investments across these accounts. Consider the tax implications of your investment choices.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so regularly review your distribution strategy.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
