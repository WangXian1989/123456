Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general outline of how to approach this:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Check if your employer offers a match. Contributing enough to get the full match is often considered a priority.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for investments that may generate capital gains, as long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Consider holding investments expected to appreciate long-term in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance, you may want to diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) across these accounts. Generally, it’s wise to keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you approach retirement, consider how you will withdraw funds. Different accounts are taxed differently upon withdrawal, so having a strategy can minimize taxes.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal circumstances vary widely. A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation, considering your overall goals and needs.

### General Example Strategy:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match.
2. Max out your IRA contributions if possible.
3. Invest any additional savings in a taxable account, focusing on low-turnover investments to minimize taxes.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth potential while minimizing tax liability.
