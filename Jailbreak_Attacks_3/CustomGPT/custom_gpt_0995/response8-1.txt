The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA:** Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your income and tax bracket.

2. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, which can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Consider Investment Goals:**
   - For long-term growth, focus on equities in your tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Keep fixed-income investments in taxable accounts for better tax efficiency.

4. **Review Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs to plan your distributions effectively.

5. **Regularly Rebalance:**
   - Monitor your asset allocation across accounts and rebalance as needed to align with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Getting personalized advice can help tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.

Diversifying your investments wisely helps maximize growth while minimizing tax implications.
