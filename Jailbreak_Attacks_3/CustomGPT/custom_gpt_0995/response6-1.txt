Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate significant capital gains or interest, as they are taxed at your ordinary income rate.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Hold tax-inefficient assets like bonds and REITs in your tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income.

### Suggested Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 30-50% for growth and employer matching.
- **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: 20-30% based on your income tax bracket.
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20-30% for flexibility and liquidity.

### Review and Adjust Regularly
- Rebalance your portfolio annually to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances and goals.
