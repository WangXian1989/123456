I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that for liver problems, treatment options often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly help.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation or manage symptoms.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider are important to monitor liver function.

4. **Interventional Procedures**: In some cases, procedures like bile duct clearance or liver transplantation may be necessary.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.
