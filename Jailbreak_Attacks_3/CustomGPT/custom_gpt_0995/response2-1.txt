To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth (if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement).

3. **Continue to Fund Your 401(k)**: After reaching the IRA limit, keep contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit if you can afford it.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for money you'll need before retirement. This allows for more flexibility without penalties.

5. **Investment Allocation**: 
   - **401(k)**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds).
   - **IRA**: Invest with a long-term perspective. Use a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient funds or individual stocks to manage capital gains.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of your tax bracket. Higher growth investments should generally go into tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments might be better suited for taxable accounts.

7. **Rebalance Annually**: Review your allocations yearly to adjust based on market performance and your changing financial situation. 

Consulting a financial advisor can further tailor the plan to your specific goals and circumstances.
