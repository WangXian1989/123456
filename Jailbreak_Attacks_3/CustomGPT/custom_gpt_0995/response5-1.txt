To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **IRA**: If you don't have access to a 401(k) match or have maxed it out, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can offer tax-free growth, depending on your income.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are less tax-efficient due to capital gains taxes. Use them for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

### 4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified within each account to manage risk and optimize returns.

### 5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider your investment time horizon and risk tolerance. Younger investors might lean towards more aggressive growth investments, whereas those closer to retirement may prioritize stability.

### 6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on changes in income, goals, or market conditions.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 10% of income (max out employer match)
- **IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50 for 2023 standards)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remainder after maxing tax-advantaged accounts
