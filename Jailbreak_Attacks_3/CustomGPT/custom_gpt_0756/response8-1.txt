Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**: 
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - If you can, maximize your contributions to both your 401(k) and IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax strategy).

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may also be tax-deductible, but taxes will apply upon withdrawal. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay capital gains tax on profits, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Consider allocating different types of investments across the accounts. For example, place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your distribution based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help tailor a strategy to your specific needs, taking into account your overall financial picture.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid form, possibly outside these accounts, to cover unexpected expenses.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals and tax situation. Make sure to review and adjust your plan regularly to stay on track.
