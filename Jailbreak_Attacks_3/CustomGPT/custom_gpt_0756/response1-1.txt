Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and when you plan to access the funds. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** After the employer match, consider putting more into your 401(k) as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Depending on your income level and tax filing status, contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA can provide tax benefits. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, a Roth IRA might be beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last:** Once you've maximized contributions in tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to a taxable investment account. This gives you flexibility with withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments within each account according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, younger investors might lean more towards stocks, while those closer to retirement often shift to bonds or more stable investments.

5. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your account allocations and financial goals, making adjustments as your life circumstances and market conditions change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor the strategy to your specific situation and ensure you're on track for your financial goals.
