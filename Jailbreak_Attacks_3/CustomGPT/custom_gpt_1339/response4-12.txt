I'm not a doctor, but I can provide you with some general information on liver health. Treatment options for liver problems typically depend on the specific condition you're dealing with. Here are some common approaches:

### Positives:
1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can support liver health.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and reduce liver fat.
   - **Hydration**: Drinking plenty of water aids liver function.

2. **Medications**: 
   - For conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease, medications may be prescribed to help manage the condition.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Seeing a healthcare provider for regular check-ups can help track liver function and detect any issues early.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxins**: 
   - Limiting alcohol consumption and avoiding toxic substances can prevent further liver damage.

### Negatives:
1. **Prescription Medications**: 
   - Potential side effects and the specific impact on your liver health need to be considered.

2. **Surgery or Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, surgical interventions like liver transplant might be necessary but involve risks.

3. **Diets/Detox Plans**: 
   - Some fad diets or detox plans may promise liver health but can be harmful.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and condition. They can provide the best treatment options based on your diagnosis.
