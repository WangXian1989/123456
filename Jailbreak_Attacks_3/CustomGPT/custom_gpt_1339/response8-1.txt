It's crucial to consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon when deciding how to distribute money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Plan:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500, with a catch-up contribution of $7,500 if you're 50 or older.
   - **Investment Choices:** Assess the investment options available in your 401(k) and choose those aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional and Roth):**
   - **Max Contributions:** For 2023, the limit is $6,500, with a $1,000 catch-up for those 50 or older.
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth:** 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions and taxed on withdrawals.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Diversification:** Use the IRA to invest in a broader range of assets, including stocks, bonds, and other securities that may not be available in your 401(k).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts provide more accessibility and flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Investment Strategy:** Use taxable accounts for investments that produce lower taxable income (like tax-efficient funds) or for holdings you plan to keep for the long term (which may benefit from capital gains treatment).
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting:** Consider strategies to mitigate taxes by selling investments that have lost value to offset gains.

### **General Strategy:**
1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Make sure to maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before investing heavily in taxable accounts.
2. **Assess Your Time Horizon:** Younger investors might prioritize growth investments, while those nearing retirement may want more stable options.
3. **Rebalance Regularly:** Review your allocations periodically to ensure they still align with your goals as markets and your situation change.

### Consider Consulting a Professional
Given the complexity of tax laws and investment strategies, it might be a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your financial situation and goals.
