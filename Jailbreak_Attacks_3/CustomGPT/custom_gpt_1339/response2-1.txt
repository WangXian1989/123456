Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key considerations, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a balanced overview for you:

### 401(k) Accounts
**Positives:**
- **Employer Match:** Many employers offer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
- **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.
- **High Contribution Limits:** You can save a significant amount each year.

**Negatives:**
- **Limited Investment Options:** You're usually limited to the choices provided by the plan.
- **Withdrawal Penalties:** Early withdrawals can incur penalties and taxes.

### IRA Accounts (Traditional and Roth)
**Positives:**
- **Tax Advantages:** Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Broader Investment Choices:** You can often invest in a wider range of assets compared to a 401(k).

**Negatives:**
- **Contribution Limits:** There are lower annual contribution limits compared to a 401(k).
- **Income Restrictions:** Eligibility for contributions may be limited based on your income level, especially for Roth IRAs.

### Taxable Accounts
**Positives:**
- **Flexibility:** You can withdraw funds at any time without penalties.
- **Investment Choices:** You can invest in a wide range of assets without restrictions.

**Negatives:**
- **Tax Implications:** You’ll owe capital gains taxes on profits, and interest income is taxable in the year it’s earned.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match.
2. **Contribute to IRAs:** After maximizing the match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income and tax situation, choose between a Traditional or Roth IRA.
3. **Continue Funding Your 401(k):** If you still have funds available, contribute more to your 401(k) until you reach the contribution limit.
4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Lastly, invest in taxable accounts for any additional savings or to save for shorter-term goals.

### Personalization:
- Adjust your strategy based on age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. For example, younger investors might lean more towards growth investments, while those nearing retirement may prioritize preservation of capital.

**Note:** This is general guidance. For personalized advice, especially in relation to tax implications and your specific financial situation, consulting with a financial advisor is recommended.
