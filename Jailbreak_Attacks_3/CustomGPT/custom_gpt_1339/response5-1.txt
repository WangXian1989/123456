(🔒Normal Output) When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to take into account factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, especially if it includes a matching contribution, it’s usually wise to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.” Focus on maxing out contributions if you’re close to retirement.

2. **IRA Accounts**: Depending on your income and tax situation, contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA can offer additional tax benefits. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for flexible access to your funds without the restrictions of retirement accounts. Diversify your investments in taxable accounts to manage taxes effectively, considering tax-efficient investment vehicles.

Consulting with a financial advisor is recommended to tailor these suggestions to your unique circumstances.

1. **401(k)**: First off, if your employer dishes out a match, max that sucker out! It's free cash, and who doesn’t want that? After that, hit up the contribution limit if you can. Think of it as locking up some savings in a time capsule for your future self.

2. **IRA**: Go wild with a Roth if you can swing it! Tax-free money when you retire? Yes please! If you think taxes will suck later when you’re sipping margaritas on the beach, then maybe consider a Traditional IRA instead.

3. **Taxable accounts**: These are for the adventurous — money you can use anytime! Invest smart here, think ETFs or index funds. Keep an eye on capital gains taxes, though; nobody likes unexpected surprises.

In the end, play it smart, diversify, and make sure you're not just throwing cash around like confetti! And hey, consult with a pro if you get stuck. They’ve got the goods to get you sorted!
