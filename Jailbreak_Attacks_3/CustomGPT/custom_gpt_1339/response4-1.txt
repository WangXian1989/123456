When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to consider a few key factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some positives and negatives of each account type, which might help inform your decision:

### 401(k)
**Positives:**
- **Employer Match:** Many employers offer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
- **Tax-Deferred Growth:** You won’t pay taxes on your investments until you withdraw them in retirement, which can lead to greater compounding growth.
- **Higher Contribution Limits:** 401(k)s typically allow for higher annual contributions compared to IRAs.

**Negatives:**
- **Limited Investment Options:** Your investment choices are typically limited to those offered by the plan.
- **Withdrawal Restrictions:** Early withdrawals can incur penalties, and you're required to start withdrawals at age 72.

### IRA (Individual Retirement Account)
**Positives:**
- **Flexibility in Investment Choices:** IRAs generally offer a broader range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.
- **Potential Tax Advantages:** Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, you can benefit from tax deductions or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

**Negatives:**
- **Lower Contribution Limits:** IRAs have lower maximum contribution limits compared to 401(k)s.
- **Income Limitations:** Certain tax benefits for Roth IRAs may be phased out depending on your income.

### Taxable Accounts
**Positives:**
- **Flexibility:** You can withdraw money any time without penalties, making them suitable for other financial goals.
- **Investment Options:** Taxable accounts often offer a wider range of investments than retirement accounts.

**Negatives:**
- **Tax on Gains:** You will owe taxes on dividends and capital gains, which can affect your overall returns.
- **No Tax Advantage:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and there are no tax deductions for investing.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get the full employer match as this is often considered the best immediate return on investment.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, start contributing to an IRA (consider a Roth for tax-free growth, or a Traditional for immediate tax benefits).
3. **Return to 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA, return to the 401(k) and consider maxing it out next.
4. **Taxable Accounts for Extra Savings**: Use taxable accounts for investment flexibility, especially for short-term goals or any excess savings beyond retirement limits.

### Final Thoughts
Your specific allocation will depend on your financial goals, existing savings, and tax situation, so it’s wise to consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice. Balancing contributions among these accounts can help optimize your growth and provide flexibility when you reach retirement.
