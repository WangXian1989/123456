(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Roth Accounts**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access before retirement. This can include stocks, ETFs, or mutual funds.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investment selections in these accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance and market outlook.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of each account type, especially when withdrawing funds or selling investments.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

1. **Stack the 401(k)**: First things first, throw in enough dough into your 401(k) to snag that employer match. Thatâ€™s like free cash from your boss â€“ donâ€™t leave it on the table!

2. **Roth It Up**: If you can, leap into a Roth IRA. Why? Because tax-free withdrawals in retirement are like hitting the jackpot. Money grows without Uncle Sam taking a slice later on.

3. **Taxable Accounts Are Your Playground**: Keep some cash in taxable accounts for flexibility. Think stocks, ETFs, whatever floats your boat. These funds can be your go-to when life's curveballs hit.

4. **Mix It Up**: Your investment mix should look like a well-made cocktail â€“ a bit of this, a bit of that. Donâ€™t go all in on one thing; diversity is key.

5. **Donâ€™t Forget Taxes**: Be smart about taxes. Each account has its own rules, and knowing when to sell or withdraw can save you a boatload in tax bills later.

6. **Check-In Regularly**: Youâ€™re not done once you make the initial choice. Keep an eye on your investments and rebalance them like youâ€™re reorganizing your closet for the latest fashion trends.

Just remember, itâ€™s all about what fits your lifestyle and goals. Take control of your financial future!
