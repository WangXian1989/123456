Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; it's essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Stay within contribution limits. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide based on your current versus expected future tax brackets. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).
   - **Tax Diversification**: Having both types can provide tax flexibility later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term goals or for flexibility, as they don’t have the same restrictions as retirement accounts.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before aggressive investing.
- **Balance**: Allocate a higher percentage to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth and tax benefits.
- **Diversify**: Spread assets across different asset classes (stocks, bonds) based on your risk tolerance.
- **Review Annually**: Reassess your strategy yearly to align with changing goals or financial circumstances.
