Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out your employer match first; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Choose Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Investment Choices**: Typically limited to what your employer offers; ensure you're diversifying within those options.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Types**: Consider whether a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA suits your situation better.
     - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions, but you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are not tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Flexibility and Options**: IRAs generally offer wider investment choices than 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed at any time without penalty.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of capital gains tax. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term rates.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds.

### **Distribution Strategy**
1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Always aim to max out tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs first, especially if there's an employer match.
2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses before heavily investing in taxable accounts.
3. **Tax Efficiency**: Place high-tax investments (like bonds or certain funds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.
4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across accounts to ensure you maintain your desired asset allocation.

### **Considerations**
- **Age and Retirement Timeline**: Younger investors may prioritize growth but should also consider risk; older investors might seek more stable returns.
- **Life Changes**: Major life events (like marriage or having children) can affect your investment strategy.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, consider speaking with a professional.

This diversified approach helps maximize growth while minimizing taxes, aligning with your financial goals.
