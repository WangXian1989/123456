Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach you might consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Needs**: Prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions for retirement savings.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need sooner.

### 2. **Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your tax strategy.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that may generate high capital gains or income, which can be taxed at a lower long-term capital gains rate.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Utilize 401(k) and Traditional IRAs for tax-deferred growth. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider placing more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k)**: 15% to 20% of your income up to the employer match. 
- **IRA**: Max out contributions ($6,500 for individuals under 50; $7,500 for those 50 and over).
- **Taxable Account**: Allocate remaining funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### Consult a Professional
Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific needs, taking into account your risk tolerance, financial goals, and expected retirement lifestyle.
