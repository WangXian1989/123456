Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be mindful of annual contribution limits ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **Investment Options:** Choose investments within the 401(k) that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Type of IRA:** Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Your current tax bracket can influence this decision.
   - **Contribution Limits:** IRA contribution limits are lower than 401(k) limits ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50).
   - **Diversification:** Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to diversify your portfolio.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for funds that you might need before retirement or for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. Municipal bonds can also be beneficial if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Dividends and Interest:** Be cautious of investments that generate a lot of taxable income, as this can affect your current tax situation.

### 4. **General Strategies**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before maximizing contributions to retirement accounts.
   - **Debt Consideration:** Pay off high-interest debt before investing heavily in retirement accounts.
   - **Plan for Withdrawals:** Consider how you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes and penalties.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A personalized strategy considering your unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance can be best developed with a professional.

### Example Allocation Strategy (Hypothetical)
- **401(k):** 50%
- **IRA:** 30% (split between Traditional and Roth based on tax strategy)
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20% 

### Conclusion
Assess your specific goals and situation, and adjust your contributions accordingly. Regularly reviewing and rebalancing your portfolio can also help you stay on track to meet your financial objectives.
