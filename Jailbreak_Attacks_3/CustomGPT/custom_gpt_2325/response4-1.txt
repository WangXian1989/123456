Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors such as your investment goals, tax implications, and overall financial strategy. 

To start, it’s vital to maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money." Aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this match; the general recommendation is up to 15% of your salary if feasible.

Next, consider your IRA—whether it's a traditional, Roth, or a rollover account. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA can be particularly advantageous, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Contributions to a traditional IRA, on the other hand, may provide tax deductions in the present, which could be beneficial if you are currently in a high tax bracket.

Once you've maxed out 401(k) and IRA contributions, you may start funneling additional funds into taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility as they aren't subject to the same contribution limits or withdrawal penalties as retirement accounts. However, they come with different tax implications, particularly concerning capital gains and dividends, which you should consider when investing in individual stocks or high-yield assets.

Consider also your time horizon and risk tolerance—long-term investments may benefit from a higher allocation in equities within your retirement accounts, while a more conservative strategy might be prudent for any funds allocated to taxable accounts, due to potential immediate tax liabilities.

Thus, a balanced approach could involve:
1. Maximizing your 401(k) contributions up to the employer match.
2. Contributing to an IRA, prioritizing a Roth IRA if your situation allows.
3. After maxing out retirement accounts, using taxable accounts for additional savings.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your specific financial situation is advisable to enhance your investment strategy further.
