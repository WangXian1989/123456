To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Max out your 401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For example, the 401(k) limit is often higher than that of IRAs.

3. **Prioritize Based on Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Great for high-income years. You'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth accounts (Roth IRA)**: Beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

4. **Assess Your Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax consequences.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high short-term capital gains, since long-term capital gains rates are typically lower.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you will withdraw from each account in retirement to minimize taxes and maximize income.

7. **Stay Informed on Tax Laws**:
   - Keep abreast of any changes to tax laws and retirement account rules that may affect your strategy.

By tailoring your contributions based on tax implications, investment goals, and personal financial situations, you can build a robust strategy for your retirement savings. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
