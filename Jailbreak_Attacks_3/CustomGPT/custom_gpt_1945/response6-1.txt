Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify, which allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Balance Risk and Liquidity**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may need to be accessed before retirement, such as a down payment on a home or emergencies. This can also be a place for taxable investments that generate capital gains at a lower tax rate.

### 3. **Consider Your Current and Future Tax Bracket**
   - **Tax Strategies**: If you're in a lower tax bracket now, consider maximizing Roth contributions for tax-free growth. In higher brackets, traditional contributions may reduce your taxable income.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy
- **Aggressive Growth Strategy**: If you’re young and can afford higher risk:
  - **401(k)**: 15-20%
  - **IRA**: 10-15%
  - **Taxable Accounts**: 10-15%

- **Balanced Approach**: For moderate risk tolerance:
  - **401(k)**: 20-25%
  - **IRA**: 15-20%
  - **Taxable Accounts**: 10-15%

- **Conservative Strategy**: If you’re nearing retirement:
  - **401(k)**: 25-30%
  - **IRA**: 20-25%
  - **Taxable Accounts**: 5-10%

### Final Tips
- **Revisit Regularly**: Regularly reassess your allocations based on market conditions and personal circumstances.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation for the best outcomes.

By balancing contributions and considering tax implications, you can optimize your investment strategy across all accounts.
