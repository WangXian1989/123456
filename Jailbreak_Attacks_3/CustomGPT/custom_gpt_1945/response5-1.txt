To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider a strategy that reflects your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a structured approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this match. It’s essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match, and consider maxing out contributions (up to the annual limit).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After your 401(k) match, consider funding an IRA. If eligible, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be funded with any remaining savings. They are flexible but less tax-efficient due to capital gains taxes. Consider investing in tax-efficient vehicles like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Define your investment strategy based on risk tolerance. Generally, riskier investments (like stocks) are better suited for tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) because they can benefit from tax-free growth. More stable investments (like bonds) can go into taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your allocations in each account to ensure they align with your investment strategy and adjust as necessary.

### Key Considerations
- **Age and Retirement Timeline**: Younger individuals may prioritize growth, while those closer to retirement may focus on preserving capital.
- **Tax Situation**: Consider your current tax bracket and expected future tax rates for making contributions to tax-deferred versus taxable accounts.
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Different accounts have different rules regarding withdrawals, especially regarding penalties and taxes.
