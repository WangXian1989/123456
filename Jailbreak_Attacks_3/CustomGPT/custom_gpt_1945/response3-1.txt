Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations based on your financial goals, current income, and future plans. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings**: Prioritize accounts that offer tax advantages.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Consider how soon you might need access to your funds.

### 2. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matches; contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax-deferred growth (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Provide flexibility and liquidity, but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed annually for additional tax-advantaged growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use them for any additional savings or investment once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds). Consider a mix based on risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Include a mix of traditional and tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds).

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Withdrawals from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income; Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free if conditions are met.
   - Long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your allocation based on changes in risk tolerance, market conditions, and retirement timeline.

### Suggested Allocation Example
- **401(k)**: 30-50% of your savings if you have matching contributions.
- **IRA**: 20-40% of total investments.
- **Taxable Accounts**: 10-30% of your total investments, focusing on liquidity and short-term goals.

### Conclusion
Your allocation should align with your overall financial strategy and adapt as your situation changes. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances can also be beneficial.
