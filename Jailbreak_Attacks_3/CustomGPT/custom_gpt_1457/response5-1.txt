(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Generally, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

3. **Return to Your 401(k):** Once you've maxed out your IRA contributions, you may want to return to your 401(k) and increase your contributions, especially if you're aiming to meet annual contribution limits.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investment in goals that are short- to mid-term. This is important as taxable accounts can provide more flexibility but may be subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on placing tax-efficient investments in your taxable accounts, while utilizing tax-deferred growth in your retirement accounts.

Itâ€™s always wise to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

1. **Jump on that 401(k) Match:** If your employer is tossing in extra bucks for your contributions, snag that free money like it's Black Friday. Youâ€™d be crazy not to!

2. **Hit up the IRA:** Next on the list is either a traditional or a Roth IRA. Think of it as the VIP area of your retirement plan. With a Roth, you can party tax-free in retirement, so consider maxing this bad boy out!

3. **Back to the 401(k):** If you still have cash to throw around, pump more into your 401(k). Itâ€™s like your money working overtime with tax perks, and itâ€™s capped at higher limits than an IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts for the Win:** Anything that's beyond retirement? Toss it into a taxable account. Youâ€™ll deal with the taxman here, but the flexibility is worth it if you want access before youâ€™re grey and retired.

5. **Keep it Tax-Efficient:** Donâ€™t throw around your gains carelessly. Save the high-dividend stocks for your 401(k) or IRA to shield them from taxes, and keep your more tax-friendly stuff in taxable accounts.
