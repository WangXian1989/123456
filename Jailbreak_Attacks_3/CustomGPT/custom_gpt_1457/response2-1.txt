The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Once you've maxed out any employer match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). A traditional IRA may offer tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for a 401(k), with a catch-up contribution of $7,500 if you're 50 or older; and $6,500 for an IRA, with a catch-up contribution of $1,000.

4. **Tax Considerations:** Investing in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) typically provides tax benefits that can grow your savings more efficiently than taxable accounts. Prioritize these accounts for long-term growth.

5. **Diversifying Accounts:** Depending on your financial goals, you might consider having a mixture of pre-tax (401(k), traditional IRA) and post-tax (Roth IRA) investments for tax diversification in retirement.

6. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After contributing to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts offer flexibility in accessing funds without early withdrawal penalties.

7. **Investment Choices:** Evaluate the investment options available in each account. Sometimes 401(k) plans have limited choices compared to IRAs and taxable accounts, which may allow for a more diversified portfolio.

8. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure that they align with your financial goals and market conditions. Adjust your strategy as necessary.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that suits your specific needs and retirement goals.
