The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some steps to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offered by employers, and contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Many employers also offer matching contributions which can be considered "free money."
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Contributions can be made pre-tax (Traditional IRA) or after-tax (Roth IRA). Each has different tax advantages depending on your situation and timeline for withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts do not have the same tax benefits as retirement accounts but provide liquidity and flexibility. You can withdraw funds without penalties, though capital gains taxes may apply.

2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), always contribute enough to take full advantage of this match first. It provides immediate returns.
   - Maximize your IRA contributions next, as they provide tax advantages. Decide between a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your current and projected future tax rates.
   - Once you’ve taken advantage of both the 401(k) match and maxed out your IRA, consider contributing to a taxable account.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - If you’re investing for retirement (which is generally long-term), focus on tax-advantaged accounts first. The growth within these accounts is often tax-deferred (or tax-free for Roth accounts).
   - If you have shorter-term financial goals (like a home purchase), you might want more liquidity, making taxable accounts a better choice.

4. **Assess Investment Strategy:**
   - Diversify your investments across accounts, focusing on growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable income-producing investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, to optimize for taxes owed on capital gains.

5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**
   - Given the complexity of taxation and financial planning, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help tailor an investment strategy to your specific situation and goals.

6. **Review Regularly:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change.

By implementing this strategy, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, maximizing your financial growth and preparing for a secure retirement.
