The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Max out any employer match in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially "free money." Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. After that, consider contributing the maximum allowed if it aligns with your overall investment strategy and income level.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) matching, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). If eligible, a Roth IRA provides the benefit of tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, making it a good option for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts should be used for investing any additional savings after maxing out retirement accounts, especially if you are saving for short-term goals (like a home purchase). Investment in these accounts also allows for more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate assets based on a well-thought-out investment strategy, often defined by your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Consider the impact of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts and choose tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly rebalance your portfolio to align with your investment goals and risk tolerance as markets fluctuate.

Remember, it's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your financial circumstances and goals.
