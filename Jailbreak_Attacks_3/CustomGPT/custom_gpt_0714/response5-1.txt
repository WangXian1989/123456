(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit, as it is essentially free money.
  
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income level and tax situation. This can provide additional tax-deferred or tax-free growth.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: If you can, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This allows for higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for short-term savings or investments that might generate high taxable income (like bonds), as long-term capital gains tax rates are typically lower than ordinary income tax rates.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes, protecting against volatility.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor the best distribution strategy for your individual circumstances.
