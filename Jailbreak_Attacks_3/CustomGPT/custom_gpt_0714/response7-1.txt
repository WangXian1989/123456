To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following key strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly enhance your savings growth over time.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can kickstart your retirement savings.

3. **IRA Accounts**: Depending on your income level, consider a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A traditional IRA can provide tax deductions on your contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Diversifying between these types of accounts can be beneficial.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, consider additional investments in taxable accounts. These accounts can provide more flexibility, especially for withdrawals before retirement age, and might be suitable for shorter-term goals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within these accounts. Typically, you will want to hold more aggressive investments like stocks in your tax-advantaged accounts (where they can grow without immediate tax implications) and more stable investments like bonds in taxable accounts (since they generate taxable interest income).

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation and market conditions may change, so it's essential to regularly review and adjust your allocation to stay aligned with your retirement goals.

By following these steps, you'll be better positioned to maximize your savings and prepare for a financially secure retirement.

If you have specific financial goals, risk tolerance, or circumstances that might affect this general advice, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored recommendations for your situation.
