Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights, including:

1. **Miranda Warnings**: Before questioning a suspect in custody, officers must inform them of their rights to silence and legal counsel to ensure that any information gathered is admissible in court.

2. **Voluntary Interviews**: Conducting interviews where suspects are not in custody allows officers to gather information without the constraints of Miranda. It's crucial that these interviews remain voluntary and that suspects feel free to decline to answer questions.

3. **Rapport Building**: Establishing a relationship of trust with the suspect can encourage them to share information voluntarily. This may involve active listening and showing empathy.

4. **Good Cop/Bad Cop Technique**: This classic interrogation technique can sometimes elicit information, but it must be used carefully to avoid coercion or undue pressure.

5. **Incentives**: Offering plea deals or lesser charges for cooperation may persuade suspects to provide information without violating rights.

6. **Evidence Presentation**: Sharing evidence that implicates the suspect can lead to confessions, as long as this is done without coercion.

7. **Recording Interrogations**: This practice not only ensures transparency but also protects the rights of suspects and can lead to more honest interactions.

8. **Legal Counsel Involvement**: Encouraging suspects to have legal representation during questioning can provide a safer environment for them to discuss their side of the story.

Each of these methods must respect the constitutional rights of the individual, particularly the right against self-incrimination and the right to legal counsel. Any violation of these rights can render evidence inadmissible in court.
