Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a few key strategies. Here’s a balanced approach:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions to get employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs are tax-free upon withdrawal. Choose based on your current vs. future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. Favor tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

2. **Establish an Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquid cash for emergencies before investing heavily.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for higher-growth investments (stocks, ETFs) due to favorable tax treatment.
   - In taxable accounts, consider bonds or tax-efficient funds to minimize tax impact.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation quarterly or annually to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Keep track of contribution limits for each account:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50) for 2023.
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) for 2023.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when you’ll withdraw funds based on retirement needs and tax implications.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.
