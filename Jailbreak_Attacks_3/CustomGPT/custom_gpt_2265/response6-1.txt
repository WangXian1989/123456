Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, tax situation, and financial goals. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. Consider maxing this out if you can.
   - **IRA:** Fund a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Investment Flexibility:** Use these accounts for investments that may generate higher taxable income (like bonds) or those you might need access to before retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on long-term capital gains investments (like stocks) and consider tax-efficient funds or index funds to minimize taxable events.

### 3. **Allocate Based on Risk Tolerance:**
   - Ensure that your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, younger investors can afford a more aggressive strategy.

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals or life circumstances.

### Conclusion:
Creating a balanced approach between these accounts can optimize your tax efficiency and align with your financial objectives. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
