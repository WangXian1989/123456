Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or traditional) for additional tax advantages. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing any matching contributions, increase your 401(k) contributions. Focus on this for higher contribution limits.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high dividends or short-term capital gains, as these can be taxed at higher rates.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a balanced asset allocation suitable for your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more income-generating assets in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalancing and Tax Efficiency**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio, considering tax efficiency. 

Consulting with a financial advisor may also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
