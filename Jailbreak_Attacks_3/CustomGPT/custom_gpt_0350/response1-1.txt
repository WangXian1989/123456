Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should consider several factors. Hereâ€™s a strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.
   - Focus on maxing out IRA contributions if you have maxed out the 401(k) match.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings and investments once you've taken advantage of tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Consider asset allocation in each account type (e.g., stocks in taxable, bonds in tax-deferred accounts) to optimize tax efficiency.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocation based on performance and life changes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.

This approach helps ensure you're maximizing tax benefits while keeping your investments diversified.
