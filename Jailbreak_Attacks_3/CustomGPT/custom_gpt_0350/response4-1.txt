Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) for its tax-deferred growth and potential employer match.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax strategy. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. Investments here can be more flexible and accessible.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment time horizon. Generally:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Stocks can be prioritized in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Bonds or Income-Generating Assets**: Consider holding these in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

5. **Consider Fees and Expenses**: Evaluate the fees associated with each account type and choose cost-effective investment options.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help craft a strategy tailored to your financial situation.

Regularly review your allocations as your goals and market conditions change.
