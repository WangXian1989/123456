To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if feasible (2023 limit is $22,500, or $30,000 if youâ€™re 50+).
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if 50+).

2. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed at capital gains rates; consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term rates.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Invest higher-risk (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.
   - Use more conservative investments (bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust as necessary based on performance and changing goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy** (for retirement):
   - Plan withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes, often starting with taxable accounts, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

By maximizing contributions, understanding tax implications, and maintaining an appropriate asset allocation, you can optimize your investment strategy across these accounts. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
