It's important to consider several factors when deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are a few strategies that might help:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, consider contributing at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great starting point.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are taxed on dividends and capital gains, which can affect your overall returns.

3. **Diversification**: Diversifying your investments across different accounts can help manage risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your investment allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it may be advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, tax-free accounts.

6. **Consulting with a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure how to allocate your investments, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your financial circumstances.

Consider these strategies as you determine how to allocate your contributions amongst your accounts, and remember to adjust your approach as your financial situation and goals evolve.
