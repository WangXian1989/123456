When it comes to distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which helps reduce your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate.
   - **IRA**: If itâ€™s a traditional IRA, it also offers tax-deferred growth, similar to a 401(k). With a Roth IRA, contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, making it a good choice for tax diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains, which can impact your overall returns.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term vs. long-term financial goals. 401(k) and IRA accounts are best for long-term growth due to their tax advantages, while taxable accounts might be more appropriate for shorter-term goals.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Asset Allocation**:
   - Allocate assets according to your risk tolerance across all accounts. For higher-risk investments, consider keeping them in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-efficient growth.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for a strategy on when and how to withdraw from each account during retirement to optimize tax implications.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of the contribution limits set by the IRS for each account type.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specifically for your financial situation. 

**Next Steps**:
1. Review your financial goals and risk tolerance.
2. Research contribution limits for each account type.
3. Consider consulting with a financial advisor.
4. Analyze potential tax implications of your investment strategy.
