3. **Engagement through Events**: Hosting events, both virtual and in-person, that encourage participation and provide a space for young people to voice their opinions can create a sense of community and engagement.

4. **Peer Influence**: Leverage influencers and peer leaders who resonate with young voters. They can share messages and mobilize their followers in a way that feels authentic.
