Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Higher Tax Accounts**: Consider contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA before putting money into taxable accounts, as these accounts offer potential tax benefits.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Traditional 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRA contributions may also be tax-deductible, similar to a 401(k). Roth IRAs, on the other hand, have tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and short-term capital gains are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate, so consider holding investments for more than a year.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a savings account before allocating large sums to investments.

5. **Consider Investment Horizon**: Money you need in the short term should be in safer, more liquid investments, while long-term funds can be invested in more aggressive assets.

6. **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and ensure you diversify within each account type to reduce risk.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation in each account and adjust as needed based on market conditions, your risk tolerance, and life changes.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your individual circumstances.
