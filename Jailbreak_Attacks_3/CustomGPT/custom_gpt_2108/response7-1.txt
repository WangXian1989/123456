- **Evaluate Financial Goals**:  
  - Define short-term and long-term objectives.  
  - Consider retirement age, lifestyle expectations, and emergency needs.

- **Understand Tax Implications**:  
  - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower taxable income. Consider employer matching.  
  - **IRA**: Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement; traditional IRAs may have tax-deductible contributions.  
  - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes; suitable for short-term goals.

- **Allocate Based on Risk Tolerance**:  
  - Conservative investors may prefer bonds in tax-advantaged accounts.  
  - Aggressive investors could favor stocks for growth potential.

- **Diversification Strategy**:  
  - Mix asset classes (equities, bonds, real estate) across all accounts.  
  - Aim for a balanced risk profile.

- **Regular Reassessment**:  
  - Review allocations annually or after major life events.  
  - Adjust contributions based on changing goals and market conditions.

- **Consider Contribution Limits**:  
  - Maximize contributions to 401(k) and IRAs to take full advantage of tax benefits.

- **Use Professional Advice if Needed**:  
  - Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

This approach promotes a balanced and informed investment strategy across various accounts.
