To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

- **Prioritize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

- **Contribute to IRAs**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) based on your tax situation and retirement goals. 
  - *Traditional IRAs*: Contributions may reduce taxable income, ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
  - *Roth IRAs*: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

- **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to maximize annual contributions to 401(k) and IRAs, as these accounts provide tax advantages.

- **Invest Taxable Accounts Strategically**: Use taxable accounts for investments that provide lower capital gains taxes, such as index funds or long-term investments. This is also a good place for emergency funds or short-term goals.

- **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess your asset allocation within accounts to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

- **Consult Financial Advisors**: Consider professional guidance to tailor your investment strategy to your financial situation and retirement objectives. 

Adjust contributions annually based on income, expenses, and changing financial goals.
