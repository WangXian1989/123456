To distribute your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

- **Assess Your Financial Goals**: Define your short-term and long-term financial objectives to guide your investment strategy.

- **Understand Account Types**:
  - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, usually with tax-deferred growth and potential employer matching contributions.
  - **IRA**: Individual retirement account offering tax advantages; consider whether a Traditional or Roth IRA fits your needs.
  - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility in withdrawals and no contribution limits, but liable for capital gains taxes on earnings.

- **Prioritize Contributions**:
  - Maximize employer match in your 401(k) firstâ€”this is essentially free money.
  - Contribute to an IRA to benefit from additional tax advantages.
  - Allocate any surplus funds to your taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

- **Diversify Investments**:
  - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts to mitigate risk.
  - Adjust the allocation based on time horizon, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

- **Consider Tax Implications**:
  - Understand how withdrawals from each account type are taxed, especially in retirement.
  - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable events, while reserving tax-advantaged accounts for growth.

- **Review Regularly**: Assess your investments and contributions annually to ensure alignment with your goals, adjusting as necessary.

By thoughtfully distributing funds across these different account types, you can optimize growth and manage taxes effectively over time.
