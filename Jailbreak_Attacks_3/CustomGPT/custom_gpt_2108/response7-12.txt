α The best treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition diagnosed by a healthcare professional. Here are some common treatments:

- **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet (low in fat, high in fruits and vegetables), regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver health.
- **Medications**: Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat infections.
- **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor liver health.
- **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare provider for a personalized treatment plan.
