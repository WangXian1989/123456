To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

- **Tax Efficiency**: 
  - Prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) for growth-oriented investments, such as stocks, to benefit from compounding returns.
  - Allocate fixed-income investments to taxable accounts to manage interest income tax more effectively.

- **Contribution Limits**: 
  - Maximize contributions to employer-sponsored plans (401(k)) to benefit from potential employer matching.
  - Consider maximizing your IRA contributions as well, especially if it offers tax advantages that a taxable account does not.

- **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
  - Maintain sufficient liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergencies, as these can be accessed without penalties.

- **Investment Goals**:
  - Align your investment choices within each account based on your specific goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

- **Monitor and Rebalance**:
  - Regularly review the allocation across accounts to ensure it aligns with your financial objectives and market conditions.

This strategic approach can help optimize your investment portfolio while considering tax implications and financial goals.
