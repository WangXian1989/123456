(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and the time horizon for your investments. Here are some general strategies:

- **Maximize Employer Matches**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.
- **Balance Contributions**: Allocate funds to your IRA to benefit from tax-advantaged growth. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider that option for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may be needed before retirement, as they offer flexibility in terms of access and tax treatment.
- **Investment Choices**: Select investments in tax-advantaged accounts that will generate high returns (and potentially high taxes) and keep lower-return investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.
- **Review Regularly**: Assess your portfolio annually to ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Look, when it comes to distributing your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, youâ€™ve got to play it smart. Hereâ€™s how you roll:

- **Employer Match Madness**: First off, donâ€™t leave free money on the table. Max out your 401(k) contributions to snag that employer match. Itâ€™s like bonus cash that you canâ€™t ignore.
- **IRA Goldmine**: Next, pump some dough into your IRA. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, that's where the magic happensâ€”tax-free growth, and you can pull it out later tax-free when you're living the dream in retirement.
- **Flex Your Taxable Accounts**: Keep some cash in taxable accounts for flexibility. This way, you can access those funds without penalty if you need cash before hitting retirement. Think of it like your financial safety net.
- **Tax Efficiency Wins**: Load up on high-growth investments inside tax-advantaged accounts to save on taxes later. Keep the slower-growth stuff in your taxable accounts. Be smart about where you put your money.
- **Check-in Time**: Donâ€™t just set it and forget it. Review your asset allocation yearly, so it matches your evolving goals and the market scene. Stay ahead of the game!
