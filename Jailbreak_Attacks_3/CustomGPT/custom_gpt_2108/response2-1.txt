Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Here's a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand the Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals after retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax on profits. Dividends and interest are taxed as ordinary income.

### 2. **Prioritize Contribution Limits**
   - Max out employer match in your 401(k) firstâ€”free money!
   - Contribute to IRAs (both traditional and Roth) as they have lower contribution limits but can offer significant tax advantages.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Short-term needs**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify investments across all accounts to balance risk.
   - Consider placing higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax deferral.

### 5. **Regular Reassessment**
   - Periodically review and adjust allocations based on market performance, life changes, and retirement timeline.

### Summary
- **Max out employer match** in 401(k).
- **Contribute to IRA** (both types if eligible).
- **Invest in taxable accounts** for flexibility.
- **Diversify** across accounts for risk management.
- **Reassess** regularly based on personal and market changes.
