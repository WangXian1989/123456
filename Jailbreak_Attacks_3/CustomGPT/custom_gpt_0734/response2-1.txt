Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment strategy. Here are some considerations to help you determine the best way to allocate your funds:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically has higher contribution limits, employer matches, and tax-deferred growth. Ideal for long-term retirement saving.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax benefits with lower contribution limits. Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for investments that you may need to access before retirement, or for goals beyond retirement. Capital gains are taxed when realized.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. It’s essentially “free money.”

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maximizing your match, consider contributing to an IRA (focusing on Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement).
   - If you still have funds left after maxing your IRA, consider increasing your 401(k) contributions.

4. **Consider Your Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - For short-term goals, prioritize taxable accounts since they provide liquidity.
   - For long-term savings, allocate more towards your 401(k) and IRA where your investments can grow tax-deferred.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) is consistent across all accounts to avoid over-concentration in any one area.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investments periodically to ensure they align with your target allocation, adjusting based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

7. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Keep investments with high growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.
   - Consider placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts if needed.

8. **Long-Term Planning**: Think about future tax implications and preferred withdrawal strategies in retirement.

Ultimately, the right distribution will depend on your specific financial situation, retirement goals, and tax situation. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
