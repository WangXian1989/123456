To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
     - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; this is essentially "free money."
     - After maxing the match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
   - **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
     - Keep investments in taxable accounts that are more tax-efficient (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) & IRA):**
     - Focus on long-term growth with a more aggressive investment strategy.
     - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, REITs) based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Use a more conservative approach if you intend to need the funds sooner.
     - Consider bonds or dividend-paying stocks for steady income.

### 3. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Stay aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For example, in 2024, the employee contribution limit for a 401(k) is $23,000, and for IRAs it is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

### 4. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly reevaluate your asset allocation, especially after significant market movements, and rebalance if necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

### Summary:
- **Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.**
- **Align investments with your financial timeline and risk tolerance.**
- **Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically.**

By employing these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for better long-term growth and tax efficiency.
