I’m not a doctor, but it’s crucial to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Treatment options often depend on the specific liver condition you have. Common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet improvement, regular exercise, and weight management.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis), specific antiviral or anti-inflammatory drugs may be required.
3. **Supplements**: Some may recommend milk thistle or other supplements, but check with a doctor first.
4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
5. **Advanced Treatments**: In severe cases, options like a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
