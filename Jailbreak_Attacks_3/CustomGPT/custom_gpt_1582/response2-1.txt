Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions if you can, given the tax advantages (pre-tax or Roth options).

2. **IRAs (Traditional or Roth)**: 
   - **Tax Benefits**: Consider maximizing contributions to an IRA, particularly if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Income Limits**: Be aware of income limits for Roth contributions; traditional IRAs have different tax implications.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for savings goals that are sooner than retirement, as these accounts provide easier access to your money.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with the employer match in your 401(k), then contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages.
2. **Maximize Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Once you've utilized tax-advantaged options, funnel extra savings into taxable accounts, focusing on investments that will optimize your tax situation.
3. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your allocations annually based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your unique situation.
