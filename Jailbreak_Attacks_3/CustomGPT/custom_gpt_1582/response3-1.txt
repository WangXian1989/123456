Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your current financial situation, future goals, and tax implications. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you’re over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs function similarly to 401(k)s. Roth IRAs, however, allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here can be subject to capital gains tax. They offer more liquidity and flexibility but can be less tax-efficient.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher growth investments (like stocks) and consider more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid early withdrawals, which can incur penalties.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances, consider consulting a professional.

By strategically distributing your investments across these accounts, you can optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency.
