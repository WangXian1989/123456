Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If your income is too high for a Roth, a traditional IRA is a good alternative.

3. **Diversify Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, you can set aside funds for emergencies and other short-term goals in taxable accounts. Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or municipal bonds.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind that withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs will be taxed as ordinary income during retirement, while Roth accounts are tax-free. This could influence how you balance contributions.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your strategy to adjust for changes in income, financial goals, or tax laws. 

Lastly, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
