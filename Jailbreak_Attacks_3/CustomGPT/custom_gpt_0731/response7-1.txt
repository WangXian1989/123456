Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After getting the match, consider maxing out your IRA. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose the type based on your current and expected future tax bracket.

3. **Contribute to 401(k)**: If you still have contribution capacity after maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. 

4. **Build Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments once you have contributed maximally to your tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts are less advantageous for long-term growth due to capital gains taxes, but they offer more flexibility.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Invest for growth (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and consider more stable investments (bonds) in taxable accounts to balance your portfolio while managing taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of taxes and investments, a personalized strategy can be beneficial.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your overall investment growth while managing your tax liabilities effectively.
