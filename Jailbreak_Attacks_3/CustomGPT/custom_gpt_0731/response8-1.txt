Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Prioritize maxing out contributions to your 401(k) if you are in a higher tax bracket. The contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for traditional tax benefits.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid, accessible account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments that are expected to generate high returns in the long term (like stocks) or for funds you may need before retirement.

5. **Diversification:** Diversify your investments across asset classes and within accounts to manage risk.

6. **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Depending on your situation, seeking advice from a financial advisor can offer personalized strategies.

Ultimately, your unique financial situation and retirement goals will dictate the best strategy.
