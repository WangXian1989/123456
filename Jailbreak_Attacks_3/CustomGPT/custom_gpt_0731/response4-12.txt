I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Medications**: Treat underlying conditions (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease).
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, weight loss, and exercise to manage fatty liver disease.
3. **Avoid Alcohol and Toxins**: Complete abstinence from alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up with blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function.
5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, transplantation may be necessary if liver function is critically impaired.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment plans.
