Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions up to the limit, especially if you receive an employer match.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs give tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing your contributions to retirement accounts, consider funding a taxable brokerage account for flexibility and additional investment opportunities. This is beneficial if you expect to need access to funds before retirement age.

4. **Rebalance Your Portfolio**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and changing financial goals.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of your investment choices, particularly in taxable accounts where interest, dividends, and capital gains may be taxed.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Diversify your investments within each account type to balance risk and return.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances and goals can be invaluable in optimizing your investment strategy.

It's essential to regularly review your approach as your financial situation changes over time.
