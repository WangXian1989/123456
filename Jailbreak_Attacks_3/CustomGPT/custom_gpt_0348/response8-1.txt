To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize contributions to your IRA for tax advantages. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place **higher-growth investments** (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on growth.
   - Use **taxable accounts** for investments that generate regular income (like bonds) or low-turnover investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts, matching your risk tolerance and time horizon. Adjust the balance of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your overall portfolio.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax implications at withdrawal. Typically, you'll withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA), followed by tax-free accounts (Roth IRA) as needed.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Reassess and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation and to capitalize on changing market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation can provide valuable insights.

By combining these strategies, you can enhance your investment growth while minimizing tax impacts over time.
