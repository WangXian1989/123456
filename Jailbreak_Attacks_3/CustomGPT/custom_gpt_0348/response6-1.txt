Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - **Contribute enough to get the full employer match**; it's essentially free money.
   - Prioritize contributions here if you're not maximizing the match.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages (IRA)**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are taxed now, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use these for funds you'll need before retirement since they don't have penalties or restrictions for early withdrawals.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **401(k):** Often good for bond investments or target-date funds.
   - **IRA:** Use for a mix of stocks and bonds; choose based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding investments that generate lower taxes, such as index funds or ETFs.

### 5. **Review Annually**
   - Adjust based on performance, life changes, and retirement goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of salary to max employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions ($6,500 if under 50; $7,500 if over).
- **Taxable Account:** Any remaining savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
Adjust based on your unique situation, and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
