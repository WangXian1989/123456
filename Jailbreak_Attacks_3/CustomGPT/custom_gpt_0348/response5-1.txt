Here's a concise breakdown for distributing your savings effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute to your 401(k) up to the match, then consider contributing more if you expect higher income in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maxing out your 401(k) match, direct funds to an IRA for additional tax advantages, depending on your income level and tax situation.

### 3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once youâ€™ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider taxable accounts for more investment freedom and liquidity, especially if you plan to access funds before retirement age.

### 4. **Balanced Investment Strategy**
   - Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Generally, equities offer growth potential, while bonds provide stability.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Regularly review your investment allocation and contribution limits to adjust based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** 12-15% of income up to the employer match, then max out.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowable amount after 401(k).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest remaining savings after tax-advantaged contributions.

### Key Considerations
- **Tax implications:** Understand the tax benefits and penalties associated with each account type.
- **Retirement goals:** Tailor your contributions based on when you expect to retire and your lifestyle expectations. 

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
