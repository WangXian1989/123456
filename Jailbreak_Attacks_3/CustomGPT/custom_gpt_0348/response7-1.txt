Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. The annual contribution limit (as of 2023) is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re over 50).

### 3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k). Consider increasing contributions beyond the match.

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

### 5. **Consider Future Tax Needs**
   - Diversify tax exposure by having accounts with different tax treatments (tax-deferred, tax-free, and taxable).

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** 15% of income (until max employer match)
- **IRA:** Max contribution ($6,500 or $7,500)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remainder after tax-advantaged accounts

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust allocations based on performance, taxes, and changes in financial goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
