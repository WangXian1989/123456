Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is effectively free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you're eligible.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds that you might need in the short term since they lack tax advantages.
   - **Interest and short-term capital gains** are taxed at your income rate, while long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) & IRA**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, ETFs) here since the tax deferral benefits work best with long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider more conservative investments or tax-efficient index funds to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a separate savings account outside of these investments.

### 5. **General Allocation**
   - **Aggressive Growth Goal**: 70% in 401(k)/IRA, 30% in taxable.
   - **Balanced Goal**: 50% in 401(k)/IRA, 50% in taxable.
   - **Conservative Goal**: 40% in 401(k)/IRA, 60% in taxable.

### 6. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your allocations as your income, expenses, and financial goals change.

### Conclusion
Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
