To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to meet any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible now.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement age. These accounts offer more liquidity, although you'll pay capital gains tax on profits.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Prioritize accounts based on tax efficiency. Generally, hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient ones (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Distribute investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustment**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.
