Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Loan and Withdrawal Rules**: Be mindful of potential penalties for early withdrawals.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide flexibility for both emergencies and short-term goals without penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be aware of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

### Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before prioritizing investments.
- **Max Out Accounts**: Aim to max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) first. 
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon—consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly real estate.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable income-generating assets in taxable accounts to maximize tax efficiency.
