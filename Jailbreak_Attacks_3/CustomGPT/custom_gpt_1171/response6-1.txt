Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; prioritize this for tax-deferred growth.
- **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Diversify Investments in Taxable Accounts
- **Taxable Investments**: Consider investing in low-turnover funds or tax-efficient ETFs to minimize taxable events.
- **Bond Allocation**: Bonds can be less tax-efficient, so consider holding them in tax-advantaged accounts if possible.

### 3. Consider Your Tax Bracket
- **Current vs. Future Tax Rates**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.
- **Tax Diversification**: Maintain a mix to provide flexibility in retirement withdrawals.

### 4. Regularly Reassess Your Strategy
- **Market Changes**: Adjust allocations based on performance and life changes.
- **Contribution Limits**: Stay informed about annual contribution limits to optimize your investments.
