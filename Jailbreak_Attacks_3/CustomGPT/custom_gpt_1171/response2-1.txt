Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations to help you think through the process:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Match:** Maximize contributions to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth), affecting your tax situation now and in retirement.

### 2. **IRAs (Traditional vs. Roth)**
   - **Tax Deductions:** Traditional IRAs offer potential tax deductions, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **Tax-Free Growth:** Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you anticipate a higher tax rate in the future.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains:** Be mindful of personal tax rates on capital gains and dividends. Investments with lower turnover can help mitigate tax implications.

### Balancing Strategy
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before allocating too much towards investments.
- **Age and Risk Tolerance:** If youâ€™re younger, you might benefit from higher allocations in stocks, while a more conservative approach could be appropriate as you near retirement.
- **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk and potentially enhance returns.

### Follow-Up Questions
- What is your age, and how far are you from retirement?
- Do you have an employer match for your 401(k)?
- What are your current tax rates and expected future income?

This framework could guide a well-rounded approach tailored to your situation. What specific goals are you aiming to achieve with your investments?
