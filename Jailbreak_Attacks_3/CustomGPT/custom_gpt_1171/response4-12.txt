I'm not a doctor, but addressing liver problems often involves several approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may help manage conditions such as hepatitis or fatty liver disease.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function can be crucial.

4. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from vitamin E or other supplements, but consult a healthcare provider first.

5. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, treatments like liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan! What specific symptoms or concerns do you have regarding your liver?
