Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can greatly depend on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize this to maximize the benefit. Aim to contribute enough to receive the full match.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, consider the tax implications. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for flexibility and accessing funds before retirement age without penalties. Investments in taxable accounts can also provide capital gains tax benefits.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals. Typically, riskier investments might be best held in tax-advantaged accounts (like the 401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes. For example, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help reduce tax liability on retirement account withdrawals.

6. **Review Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on market conditions and changes in your personal circumstances.
