Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach to balance growth, taxes, and access. Here are some considerations to guide your decision:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxed in the year they are realized, which can affect your returns depending on your income bracket.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Consider your time horizon. For longer-term investments, a more aggressive allocation might be appropriate, especially in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term needs, ensure liquidity in your taxable accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Max out matches in your 401(k) first as itâ€™s essentially free money.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk and enhance returns.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for when and how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Balancing between tax-advantaged and taxable accounts can minimize tax impacts.

6. **Professional Advice**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy suited to your unique financial landscape.

Ultimately, the "best" distribution depends on your personal circumstances, including income, financial goals, and risk tolerance. Have you thought about your specific goals or timeframe for needing access to these funds?
