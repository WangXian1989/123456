The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the maximum match. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Maximize IRA Contributions**:
   - After securing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). For 2023, the contribution limits are $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income in the current year, whereas Roth accounts offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - Consider your current tax bracket and expected tax situation in retirement to decide between traditional versus Roth accounts.

4. **Diversify Between Accounts**:
   - If you have maxed out contributions to retirement accounts, allocate any additional savings to a taxable account. This allows for more liquidity and flexibility.
   - Taxable accounts also allow you to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains taxes on investments held for over a year.

5. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place assets with the highest expected growth (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Consider holding income-generating assets (like bonds or REITs) in taxable accounts, where capital gains rates may be more favorable than ordinary income tax rates.

6. **Reassess Periodically**:
   - Reevaluate your asset allocation and distribution strategy periodically or as life circumstances change (such as a job change, marriage, or having children).

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial picture and guide you through tax implications and investment strategies.

By following these guidelines, you can create a well-rounded approach to distributing your investments across different account types that aligns with your overall financial objectives.
