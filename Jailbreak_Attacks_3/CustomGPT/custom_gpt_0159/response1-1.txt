Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines that may help:

1. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts are typically made pre-tax (for traditional accounts) or post-tax (for Roth accounts), affecting your taxable income. Distributions from these accounts in retirement may be taxed as ordinary income (traditional) or tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Interest and dividends are also taxable in the year they are received.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), take full advantage of that benefit first before allocating funds to other accounts, as it's essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize Roth Accounts**:
   - If youâ€™re eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k), as these can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This is especially advantageous if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure your investments across these accounts align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. You can have more aggressive investments in accounts that won't be tapped for several years (like retirement accounts) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts if you might need them sooner.

5. **Balance Contributions**:
   - Depending on your income and tax situation, it might make sense to split contributions as follows:
     - Max out 401(k) contributions to benefit from matching.
     - Contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth) for additional tax advantages.
     - Use taxable accounts for liquidity and investments that may produce high capital gains (like growth stocks).

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Your situation can change, so regularly review your asset allocation and account performance to ensure it still aligns with your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your complete financial picture, helping maximize your tax efficiency and retirement strategy.

This distribution strategy can help you achieve a balanced approach to building your wealth while considering tax implications and retirement needs.
