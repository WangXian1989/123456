When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to take into account your financial goals, tax situation, investment strategy, and time horizon. Here’s a multi-step approach to guide you:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
    - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth and potential employer contributions. You pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
    - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Also tax-advantaged, with options for traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth) IRAs.
    - **Taxable Accounts**: Allow for more flexibility in withdrawals, but investment gains are subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Determine Your Goals**:
    - Define your short-term and long-term financial goals. Retirement accounts are generally best for long-term savings, while taxable accounts can be useful for more immediate needs.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
    - Consider your current vs. expected future tax rate. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, focus more on Roth IRAs. If you’re currently in a higher tax bracket, traditional options might be better.

4. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
    - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match since it’s essentially “free money.”
    - Next, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if it’s a Roth IRA, for its tax benefits.

5. **Distribute Among Accounts**:
    - After maximizing employer matching contributions and IRA contributions, allocate remaining funds based on your liquidity needs and investment strategy.
    - Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the short-term or for investing in assets that may incur capital gains.

6. **Diversify Investments**:
    - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to minimize risk.
    - Consider the tax implications of the investments based on the account type. For instance, you may want to hold income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts and opt for growth investments in taxable accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust Periodically**:
    - Regularly review your asset allocation and the performance of each account, and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
    - If you’re uncertain about your strategy or need personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored guidance.

This approach ensures that you are utilizing tax advantages effectively while aligning your investment strategy with your financial goals.

**Summary**: Prioritize maxing out 401(k) contributions (especially to get any employer match), then fund an IRA (considering its tax benefits), and finally allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts, taking into account your investment strategy, liquidity needs, and tax implications. Regularly review and adjust your strategy as necessary.
