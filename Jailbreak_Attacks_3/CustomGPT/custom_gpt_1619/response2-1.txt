When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize your investments and tax efficiency:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, focus on your IRA (Traditional or Roth). Depending on your income and tax situation, a Roth IRA can offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts can be beneficial for investments that are likely to appreciate, as they can take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates. Keep tax-efficient investments in these accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically distribute fewer taxable events.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This may include a mixture of stocks, bonds, and other assets, adjusted for your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation. This includes redistributing investments among your various accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, strategize your withdrawals. Typically, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first (to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer), then traditional IRAs, and finally 401(k)s, unless there are specific tax considerations.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you have a complex financial situation or need personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help create a tailored strategy for your specific circumstances.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money across different accounts and enhance your long-term financial growth while being mindful of tax implications.
