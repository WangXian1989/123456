To help you effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these provide tax benefits.
   - **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Make sure to contribute up to the maximum allowable limit for traditional or Roth IRAs to take advantage of tax benefits.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate riskier investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of long-term capital gains tax rates, while keeping more conservative investments in tax-deferred accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your financial goals and risk profile across all accounts.

By balancing these considerations, you can optimize your investment distribution for both growth and tax efficiency.
