The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Contributions**: Focus on maximizing any employer match first, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose a diverse mix of investments based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: With a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid on withdrawals in retirement. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement but requires after-tax contributions.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Make sure to adhere to annual contribution limits for IRAs. Prioritize funding this account for its tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties but do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses in a liquid savings account before heavily investing.
- **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, it may be wise to pay that off before investing.
- **Allocation Strategy**: Consider a balanced approach, splitting contributions based on your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and financial goals.
- **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level as your investments grow.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also a good idea for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.
