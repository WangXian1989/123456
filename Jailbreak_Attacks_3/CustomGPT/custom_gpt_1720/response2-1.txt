The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. These accounts can provide tax benefits that help your investments grow more efficiently.

3. **Account Types and Tax Treatment**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income for the current year. Consider maxing this out first, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits to 401(k) but has contribution limits. If you're eligible, consider contributing to this as well.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, this can be advantageous.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for funds you may need in the short term. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Diversification and Investment Strategy**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. You can adjust your investment strategy based on the account type and your financial goals.

5. **Consider Fees and Expenses**: Some 401(k) plans have higher fees, which could affect your returns. Compare investment options and consider where to place higher-fee investments wisely.

6. **Long-term Growth vs. Short-term Needs**: Identify your time horizon. Fund long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts and consider keeping more liquid investments in taxable accounts.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust as necessary based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances and optimize your distribution.
