The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account for unexpected expenses.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize your 401(k) and IRA contributions, as they offer tax advantages. For 2023, consider the following:
   - Contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) if your employer offers a matching contribution.
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement (if income limits allow).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and additional investment opportunities. Taxable accounts can also be useful for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. For longer-term goals, you might lean towards stocks, while for shorter-term needs, bonds or cash may be more appropriate.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
