When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to think about a few key factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions (taxed on withdrawal), while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are taxed on dividends and capital gains, so consider your current and future tax brackets.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (plus $7,500 catch-up if you're over 50) and the IRA limit is $6,500 (plus $1,000 catch-up).

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Consider your financial goals and how soon you plan to access the funds. Long-term investments may benefit more from tax-advantaged accounts, while short-term needs might be better suited to taxable accounts.

**Suggested Strategy**:
- Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
- After maximizing the match, assess whether to contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your current tax situation.
- Use taxable accounts for savings beyond the tax-advantaged limits or for funds needed in the near future.
