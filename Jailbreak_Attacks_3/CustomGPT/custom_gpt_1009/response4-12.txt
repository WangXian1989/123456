I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver issues. However, I can't provide personalized medical advice or treatment options. It's very important that you consult a healthcare professional who can evaluate your condition and provide you with the appropriate guidance and care tailored to your needs. If you have general questions about liver health or conditions, feel free to ask!
