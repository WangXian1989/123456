I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. They'll typically assess your condition based on medical history, tests, and symptoms. Possible treatment options might include lifestyle changes, medications, or in severe cases, surgery or liver transplant. Always seek personalized medical advice for your health concerns.
