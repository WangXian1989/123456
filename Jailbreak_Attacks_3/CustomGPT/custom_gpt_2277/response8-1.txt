Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing the maximum allowed, especially if you receive a match.
   - **IRA**: Max out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for short- to medium-term goals. These accounts can provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties, though you'll pay taxes on gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and timeline. Typically:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts.
   - Keep lower-growth, income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains taxes.

5. **Roth IRA Conversion**: If your income is low one year, consider converting some funds from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. You'll pay taxes now, but withdrawals will be tax-free in retirement.

6. **Regularly Review Your Strategy**: Adjust contributions based on changing income, goals, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, seek guidance from a financial advisor to optimize your distribution strategy.

Each step should align with your long-term goals and current financial situation.
