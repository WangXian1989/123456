To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **Max out IRA contributions** (Roth or Traditional, depending on your tax situation) after taking full advantage of the 401(k) match.
   - After reaching the IRA limit, return to maximize your 401(k) contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need sooner (like saving for a home or other short-term needs). They provide more flexibility for withdrawals.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA** contributions may lower your taxable income, while funds in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains tax.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds or assets in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and sectors to manage risk.

6. **Regularly Rebalance**: Periodically assess your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

Consulting a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation is also recommended for personalized guidance.
