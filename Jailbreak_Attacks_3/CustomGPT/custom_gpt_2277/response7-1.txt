Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. Contribute to an IRA
   - **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA:** Consider maxing out contributions (if eligible). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions.

### 3. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
   - After hitting the employer match in your 401(k), prioritize contributing to your IRA since it offers tax advantages.

### 4. Fund the 401(k) Further
   - Once your IRA is maxed out, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, benefiting from pre-tax contributions.

### 5. Allocate to Taxable Accounts
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments, especially if you've maxed out tax-advantaged options.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liability.

### Considerations:
- **Age and Timeline:** Younger investors may lean towards more aggressive growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement might prioritize stability.
- **Tax Bracket:** Be mindful of how withdrawals in retirement will affect your tax situation.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** 15% of income to take full advantage of the employer match and potentially higher limits.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions each year.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional savings after reaching limits on your 401(k) and IRA.

### Regular Reassessment:
- Review your allocations periodically and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or retirement goals.
