Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA):**
     - Focus on more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in these accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
     - Traditional accounts may benefit from tax deductions and tax-deferred growth.
     - Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them ideal for anticipated higher tax brackets.

   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Hold less tax-efficient investments (like bonds and REITs) here to manage capital gains more effectively.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. Consider your risk tolerance and investment time frame.

### 4. **Account Contribution Limits:**
   - Stay aware of contribution limits:
     - 401(k): $22,500 (2024 limit) + $7,500 catch-up if you're over 50.
     - IRA: $6,500 (2024 limit) + $1,000 catch-up if you're over 50.
   - Allocate funds accordingly.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Stay Informed on Tax Implications:**
   - Understand the long-term tax implications of withdrawals from each account type to strategize withdrawals in retirement.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach tailored to your unique financial situation will yield the best results. Consulting a financial advisor can further personalize your strategy.
