Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your expected tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth, while keeping more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts for potential tax advantages on interest.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider working with a pro to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.

By using this approach, you can maximize your returns while minimizing taxes over the long run.
