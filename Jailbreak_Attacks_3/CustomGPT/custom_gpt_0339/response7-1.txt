To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: If you can contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth), consider funding this next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts for more flexibility.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Growth Investments** (stocks, ETFs): Preferably held in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Income Investments** (bonds, dividend stocks): May be better in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

Consult a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific situation.
