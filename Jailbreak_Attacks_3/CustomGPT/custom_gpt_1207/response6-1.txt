When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to balance your short-term and long-term financial goals while also considering tax implications. Here are some strategic recommendations:

### 1. **Prioritize Contribution Limits**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income level, you might have access to either a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, each with their tax advantages.

### 2. **Tax Strategy Consideration**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Contributions to your 401(k) and Traditional IRA reduce your taxable income for the year, which is advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Funds that you expect to use in the near future or that have already been taxed might be placed in taxable accounts for liquidity. 

### 3. **Consider Asset Allocation**
   - **Long-Term Investments:** Place growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on capital gains.
   - **Income-generating Investments:** Consider placing income-generating assets (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) in your taxable account to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

### 4. **Regular Review and Rebalancing:**
   - **Annual Review:** Regularly reassess your asset allocation and the performance of your accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - **Rebalance as Necessary:** If one account significantly outperforms others, consider rebalancing to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Conclusion:
To achieve a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to secure employer matching, follow up with IRA contributions for either tax-deferred or tax-free growth, and utilize taxable accounts for short-term goals or liquidity. Always consider your personal financial situation and consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
