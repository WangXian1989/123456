To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older) and for IRAs, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). 

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, while withdrawals in retirement are taxed. Roth accounts (if available) are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free if certain conditions are met. Think about your current tax rate versus your projected retirement tax rate to determine whether to focus on traditional or Roth accounts.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Your asset allocation should reflect your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. Typically, younger investors may favor a more aggressive allocation (more stocks), while those nearing retirement might prioritize stability (more bonds). 

5. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes to manage risk. Within your accounts, consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Monitor your asset allocation regularly and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level. This may involve shifting funds from one account to another or adjusting the types of investments within each account.

7. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Utilize taxable accounts for investments that you might need access to before retirement or for tax-efficient investments, such as municipal bonds or low-turnover index funds.

In summary, consider maximizing employer contributions, prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts, being mindful of tax implications, and maintaining a balanced investment strategy across all accounts to optimize growth and ensure liquidity as needed.
