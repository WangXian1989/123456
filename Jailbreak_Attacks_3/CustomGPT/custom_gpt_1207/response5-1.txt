(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, make sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, consider putting more funds into tax-advantaged accounts like your IRA. Traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free.

3. **Consider Taxes on Withdrawals**: Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free. Think about your expected tax bracket during retirement when deciding how much to contribute to each.

4. **Investment Choices**: In taxable accounts, consider investing in tax-efficient index funds or ETFs to minimize tax impacts. Taxable accounts can also give you flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an appropriate emergency fund before allocating significant sums to any retirement or investment account.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow and change over time, be sure to rebalance your portfolio so that it aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that is specific to your individual circumstances.

1. **401(k) First**: Jump on that employer match like it's your last slice of pizza! Get that free money into your 401(k) right away!

2. **IRA Time**: After caping that free cash, load up your IRA next. Roth or Traditional depends on whether you want the tax hit now or later. Think long gameâ€”if you're young, go for the Roth, because tax-free growth is like winning the lottery!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Lastly, toss some cash into taxable accounts for flexibility. Just keep an eye on those pesky taxes; dividends and capital gains can bite, so be smart about it and maybe lean towards ETFs or index funds.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Don't skimp on that safety net! Build up a solid emergency fund before diving deep into the investment gameâ€”can't cash out of retirement accounts without fees or penalties!

5. **Keep it Fresh**: Regularly check your portfolio and rebalance it. Markets can be like roller coastersâ€”don't wait for your funds to plummet before making changes!
