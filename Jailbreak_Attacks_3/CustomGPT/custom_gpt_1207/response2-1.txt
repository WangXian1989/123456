The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, focus on your IRA (whether it’s traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA, funded with after-tax dollars, allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you still have extra funds after maxing out your IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k). The contribution limits are usually higher than those for IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can start investing in taxable accounts. This is useful for short-term goals or if you need more liquidity. Keep in mind the tax implications of capital gains.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**: Consider the types of investments you hold in each account. For example:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Keep income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts if possible, as they may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

6. **Reevaluate and Adjust**: Regularly assess your financial situation and make adjustments as needed. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

Remember to keep your overall investment strategy and goals in mind when deciding how to allocate funds across these accounts.
