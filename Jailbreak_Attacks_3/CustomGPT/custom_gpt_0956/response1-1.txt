Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider funding this if you are in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar benefits. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, contributions are made post-tax, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t have the same tax advantages but allow for flexibility in withdrawals. If you have maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts or need liquidity for short-term goals, consider this option.

3. **Investment Goals**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Longer-term investments can afford more risk (like stocks), while short-term goals might necessitate more conservative investments (like bonds or cash).

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This reduces risk and can enhance returns.

5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on performance, changes in goals, or life circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation and ensure you're optimizing your tax impacts and growth potential.
