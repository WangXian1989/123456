1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Dietary Adjustments:** Incorporate a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and limit sugary, fatty, and processed foods.
   - **Regular Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help improve liver health and overall well-being.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the liver condition (such as hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.
   - Anti-viral medications are common for viral hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring and Follow-Up:**
   - Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function and make necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.

4. **Advanced Treatments:**
   - In severe cases, options such as liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options tailored to your specific condition.
