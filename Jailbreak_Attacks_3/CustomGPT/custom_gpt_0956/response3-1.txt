It's important to have a well-structured investment strategy to make the most out of your savings across different accounts, such as a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some steps to help you distribute your money effectively:

1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan that often comes with tax benefits and potential employer matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Personal retirement account that offers tax advantages. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts where you pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains. There’s no limit on how much you can contribute, giving you more flexibility.

2. **Evaluate Your Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term, medium-term, and long-term financial goals, such as buying a house, retirement, or creating an emergency fund.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Place higher-growth investments, like stocks, in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to minimize tax impact.
   - Allocate more conservative investments, such as bonds or dividend-paying stocks, in your taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

4. **Create a Contribution Strategy**:
   - Aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. Contribute enough to at least capture the full match.
   - After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure you're diversifying your portfolio across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk.
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain desired asset allocation.

6. **Monitor Performance and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment performance and overall contribution levels. Make adjustments based on your changing financial situation or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you’re unsure, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific circumstances and goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced investment plan that optimizes your savings across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
