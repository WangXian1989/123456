I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver problems. Treatment options often depend on the specific condition affecting the liver, whether it's fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or something else. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications to manage symptoms, and in some cases, procedures or surgeries. Always get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan from a qualified medical expert. Your health is important!
