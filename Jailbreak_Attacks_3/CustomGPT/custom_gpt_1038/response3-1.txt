Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth Accounts**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.

### 3. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - If your goal is long-term growth, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA.
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals since you can easily access your money without penalties.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Consider your current and expected future tax rates when deciding between traditional and Roth accounts.
   - Taxable accounts may be better for investments that generate capital gains rather than interest to minimize tax implications.

### 5. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk and enhance growth potential.

### 6. **Annual Contribution Limits**:
   - Stay within IRS contribution limits for each account type to maximize your savings.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your investment allocations to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Maximize employer match, then contribute up to the annual limit.
- **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest surplus funds after maximizing retirement accounts.

### Conclusion:
It’s advisable to review your personal financial situation or consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns best with your goals. Regularly reassess your investments and adjust them as needed.
