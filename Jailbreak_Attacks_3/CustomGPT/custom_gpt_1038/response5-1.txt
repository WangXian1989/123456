Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
- **401(k):** Contributions reduce your taxable income, and investments grow tax-deferred. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current versus anticipated future tax brackets.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes upon selling. They offer flexibility for access to funds without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals.

### 2. Contribution Limits
- **401(k):** Offers a higher contribution limit compared to IRAs. Maximize contributions to your employer's plan, especially if they match.
- **IRA:** Max out IRA contributions after your 401(k) if eligible, particularly for a Roth IRA if you're within income limits.

### 3. Investment Strategy
- Consider your risk tolerance and investment time horizon. Generally:
  - **Long-Term Investments:** Suitable for retirement accounts (401(k), IRA) with potential for tax-deferred growth.
  - **Shorter-Term Needs:** Utilize taxable accounts for more liquid assets or funds needed in the near term.

### 4. Retirement Timeline
- If retirement is several years away, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts to grow your investments tax-free. As you near retirement, you might want to shift some assets to taxable accounts to manage withdrawal strategies more effectively.

### Suggested Approach
1. **Contribute to Your 401(k):** Max out to receive any employer match.
2. **Fund an IRA:** Prioritize a Roth IRA if eligible; otherwise, contribute to a Traditional IRA.
3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Use for flexibility and short-term investing once tax-advantaged accounts are maximized.

This distribution strategy helps balance tax efficiency with liquid access to funds, aligning with your financial goals. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
