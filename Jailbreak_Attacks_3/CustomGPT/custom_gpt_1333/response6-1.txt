Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get employer matching, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Determine Your Investment Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Allocate more to 401(k) and IRA for compounding growth and tax benefits.
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for flexibility and access without penalties.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for lower tax rates.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Place higher-growth assets here to delay taxes.

### 4. **Risk Tolerance and Asset Allocation**
   - Align your investment choices within each account based on your risk tolerance.
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds) in a way that balances your total portfolio.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your income, targeting employer match.
- **IRA (traditional or Roth):** Max out contributions ($6,500 for 2023).
- **Taxable Account:** Direct additional savings based on short-term needs or surplus funds.

### Additional Tips
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust allocations based on performance and risk tolerance.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personalized advice can help optimize your specific situation. 

Tailor these strategies to fit your unique circumstances and goals for the best outcome.
