Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Focus on Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts. These are more flexible for withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Mix**: Consider your risk tolerance:
   - **Long-term growth**: Stocks in retirement accounts.
   - **Short-term needs**: More conservative investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Tailoring a strategy to your specific situation can yield the best results, so consulting a financial advisor is often beneficial.

Adjust your contributions based on your income, expenses, and financial goals as needed.
