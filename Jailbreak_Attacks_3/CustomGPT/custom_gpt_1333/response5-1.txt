Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, age, income, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If you're eligible, maximize contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k), especially if you have a higher income and youâ€™re looking for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for extra savings, especially if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

5. **Diversification**: Make sure to diversify investments across all accounts, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized recommendations tailored to your specific situation.
