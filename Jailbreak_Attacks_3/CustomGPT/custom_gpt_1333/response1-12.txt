I'm not a doctor, but common treatments for liver problems generally include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver health.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (like antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function are essential.

4. **Supplements**: Some people benefit from vitamins and supplements, but it's essential to consult a doctor first.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplants might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific situation.
