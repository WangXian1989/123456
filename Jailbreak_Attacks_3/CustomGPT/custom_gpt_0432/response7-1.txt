The best strategy for distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great starting point.

### 2. **Consider Taxation**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal. Suitable for long-term growth if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax. Theyâ€™re useful for short-term needs or if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in the future.

### 3. **Debt and Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund and consider paying off high-interest debt before investing significantly.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that generate high taxable income, such as bonds or real estate investment trusts (REITs).
   - Place investments with high growth potential (like stocks) in taxable accounts if they're also in a tax-advantaged account to benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Diversify across different assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to spread risk.

### Suggested Allocation Example
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income up to the employer match.
- **Roth IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed after reaching the match.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest excess savings after maxing tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Regular Review and Adjust**
   - Periodically review your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Conclusion
The ideal distribution varies for everyone. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your personal circumstances.
