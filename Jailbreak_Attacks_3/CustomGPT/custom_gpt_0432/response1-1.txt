Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRAs**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA and anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals. If you're in a lower tax bracket now, a traditional IRA could provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that might generate high short-term capital gains or distributions (like bonds or mutual funds) to manage tax efficiency. They also offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Keep a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts. This helps minimize risk.

5. **Revisit Periodically**: Review your asset allocation regularly and adjust according to changing financial goals or market conditions.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your personal financial situation.

Balancing these accounts effectively can help optimize your tax situation while allowing for growth as you work toward your financial goals.
