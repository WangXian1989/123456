To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if feasible.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you qualify based on income. If you prefer immediate tax deductions, a traditional IRA may be beneficial.

### 2. **Prioritize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement. They offer greater flexibility in terms of withdrawals, without penalties.

### 3. **Allocate Investments Strategically**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus these accounts on long-term growth investments (like stocks) since taxes are deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider investments with favorable tax implications, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs. This helps minimize capital gains taxes.

### Summary
- Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first.
- Maintain flexibility with taxable accounts.
- Strategically allocate investments based on tax implications.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored strategies based on your individual financial situation.
