Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if it’s a Roth IRA, which can provide tax-free growth.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can provide flexibility for withdrawals but are taxed on capital gains and dividends. Use these for investments you want to access sooner or that could generate income.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across accounts are diversified. This helps manage risk while aligning with your overall investment strategy.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Long-term investments (like stocks) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while short-term investments or those with higher turnover (like bonds) may be best in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Future Tax Brackets**:
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, favoring Roth accounts may be beneficial, as withdrawals are tax-free.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A tailored strategy based on your specific financial situation, risk tolerance, and goals can provide the best outcomes.

Make sure to revisit your strategy periodically to adjust for changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.
