To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on contributing to your 401(k) first, as it typically offers tax-deferred growth and may have lower fees.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged options, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Use these for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

### Suggested Allocation:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any remaining funds here.

### Considerations:
- **Investment Goals**: Tailor your investments to your time horizon and risk tolerance.
- **Tax Implications**: Be aware of the tax treatment for each account type when planning withdrawals.

This balanced approach allows for growth while minimizing tax impacts and maximizing benefits.
