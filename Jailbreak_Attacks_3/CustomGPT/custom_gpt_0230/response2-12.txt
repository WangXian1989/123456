   - **Weight Management**: Maintaining a healthy weight helps reduce liver strain.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis (like Hepatitis B or C).
   - **Steroids**: To reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Frequent check-ups with blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Avoid Alcohol**:
   - Avoiding alcohol is crucial for liver health.

5. **Surgery**:
