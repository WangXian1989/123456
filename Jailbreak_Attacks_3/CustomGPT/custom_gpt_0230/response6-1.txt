Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing growth potential and tax implications. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **Contribute to 401(k)**: Aim for the employer match, then max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Depending on eligibility, prioritize contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax-deferred Accounts**: Use 401(k) and Traditional IRA for long-term growth without immediate tax. 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for investments with lower tax rates (like qualified dividends) and for flexibility in withdrawals.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to manage risk and optimize returns.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your financial goals.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain a separate fund in a high-yield savings account for liquidity.

### 5. **Long-Term Goals**
   - Align your investments with long-term financial goals (retirement, education, etc.).

### Conclusion
- **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts**, **maintain a diversified portfolio**, and **reassess periodically** to align with changing financial goals.
