I'm not a doctor, but there are various treatment options depending on your liver condition. Common treatments include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Certain conditions, like hepatitis, may require antiviral medications or immunosuppressants.

3. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
