Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund IRA**: Next, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth, but if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA might be better.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue to fill up your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Check for low-cost investment options within your plan.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, any surplus savings can be directed to taxable brokerage accounts. These are more flexible but come with capital gains taxes.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance across all account types, considering asset allocation and tax efficiency.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review and adjust your strategy annually or during major life changes.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these steps to your specific circumstances.
