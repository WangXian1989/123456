Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your age, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Good for high contributions and potential employer matching. Consider contributing the maximum if you're close to retirement.
   - **IRA**: A traditional IRA can offer tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. Use these for savings goals that may require access before retirement.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Hold higher-growth investments in these accounts since they benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Income in Taxable Accounts**: Keep investments that generate regular income (like dividends) in taxable accounts for lower tax rates.

5. **Diversity and Rebalancing**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Regularly rebalance to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
