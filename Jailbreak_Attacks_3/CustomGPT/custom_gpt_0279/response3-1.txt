The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. These accounts grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

3. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, this can be beneficial.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds) within each account to manage risk.

5. **Investment Strategies**:
   - Consider keeping more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, as these will benefit more from the tax deferral. Use taxable accounts for investments that generate income (like bonds) that may be taxed at a higher rate.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Revisit and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

7. **Long-Term Planning**:
   - Understand the withdrawal rules and requirements for each account type to strategize for retirement income effectively.

By carefully planning your contributions and investment strategies based on these principles, you can maximize your savings potential and minimize tax impact in retirement.
