When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on tax-deferred growth. Use this for higher-income investments to reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. If you choose a Traditional IRA, it may provide immediate tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income (like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains). 

3. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to spread risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, plan withdrawals to minimize taxes. Typically, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Keep aware of annual limits for each account type to optimize your contributions.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before aggressively investing.

7. **Review Periodically**: Reassess your allocations annually to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.
