I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals** for hepatitis infections.
   - **Diuretics** for fluid retention.
   - **Liver support supplements** (consult a doctor before use).

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary adjustments**: Focus on a balanced diet, limit alcohol, and avoid fatty foods.
   - **Regular exercise** to maintain a healthy weight.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - **Routine blood tests** to monitor liver function.
   - **Imaging tests** (like ultrasounds) to assess liver health.

4. **Surgery**:
   - **Liver transplant** for severe liver disease.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
