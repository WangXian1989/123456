To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that produce lower taxable income, such as:
     - Index funds
     - Tax-efficient ETFs
   - **Tax-advantaged Accounts**: Hold higher-growth investments, like stocks, which may generate more taxable income when sold.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - In lower tax brackets, taxable accounts may be more beneficial.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts.

### Summary
Prioritize contributions based on employer matches, tax implications, and your personal investment strategy to optimize growth and manage taxes effectively.
