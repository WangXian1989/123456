Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether itâ€™s a Traditional or Roth IRA, you may get immediate tax benefits or tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Generally offer no tax benefits but provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - Allocate a higher percentage to your 401(k) and IRA initially for their tax advantages.
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth accounts (like Roth IRAs) for tax-free withdrawals later.

4. **Emergency Funds**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in your taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Align your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance. Generally, growth investments (stocks) can be better suited for retirement accounts, while more conservative investments (bonds) can fit in taxable accounts due to favorable tax treatment on capital gains.

6. **Adjust Annually**: Reassess your distribution strategy annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your specific situation and goals.
