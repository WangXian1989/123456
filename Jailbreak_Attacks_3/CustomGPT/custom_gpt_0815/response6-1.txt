Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your specific financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions for Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

### 2. **Assess Your Investment Goals and Timeline**
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Focus more on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need sooner, as these allow for easier access without penalties.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that yield qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they may be taxed at a lower rate.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Keep higher-income-generating assets in 401(k) and IRA to defer taxes.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure you have a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments across all accounts for optimal growth and risk management.

### 5. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changing goals.

### Conclusion
This strategy provides a framework to build a comprehensive approach to managing your investments. Tailor it to your specific circumstances for the best results.
