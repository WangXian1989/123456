The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits:** The IRS has annual contribution limits; ensure you're aware of those.

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth:** Depending on your current vs. future tax situation, decide whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) is more beneficial.
   - **Maximize Your Contributions:** Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if your budget allows.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexible Withdrawals:** Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider investments that generate less taxable income (e.g., index funds, tax-managed funds).

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Diversify Investments:** Within each account, ensure you're diversifying your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Rebalance Annually:** Regularly assess and adjust your asset allocation to align with your financial goals.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Understand Capital Gains Taxes:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments in taxable accounts.
   - **Use Tax-Loss Harvesting:** Consider selling losing investments to offset gains and reduce tax liabilities.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach focusing on maximizing the benefits of each account type while considering your individual goals will often yield the best results. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific situation.
