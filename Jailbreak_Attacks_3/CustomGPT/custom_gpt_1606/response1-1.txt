Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first—this is free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, invest in a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings, especially for goals within the next 5-10 years. This allows for flexibility but consider tax implications on capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient ones (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
