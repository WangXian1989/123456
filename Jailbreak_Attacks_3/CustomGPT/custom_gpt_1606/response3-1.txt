Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRAs**: If you’re eligible, fund a Roth or Traditional IRA, especially if you’re in a lower tax bracket. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Pay Attention to Taxes**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate little taxable income (like index funds) to minimize taxes. High-dividend or actively traded investments might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversify Contributions**: Balance contributions between accounts based on your retirement timeline:
   - Short-term goals: Favor taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - Long-term goals: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Assess your overall allocation yearly and adjust as needed to meet your risk tolerance and investment goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
