To optimize your money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (especially if there are employer matches or tax benefits).

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks).

3. **Investment Diversification**:
   - Ensure diversification across all accounts, aligning with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax implications during retirement regarding withdrawals. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Stay Updated**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, life changes, and tax laws.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
