Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. Here are some key techniques:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Encouraging suspects to talk freely in a non-coercive environment.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Informing suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning.

3. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a trusting relationship to encourage cooperation without pressure.

4. **Cognitive Interviewing**: Using open-ended questions that help suspects recall more details without leading them.

5. **Psychological Techniques**: Applying techniques that appeal to a suspectâ€™s emotions or logic, while ensuring not to manipulate or coerce.

6. **Legal Counsel**: Ensuring suspects have access to legal representation during questioning to uphold their rights.

These methods emphasize voluntary participation and protect the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
