Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages. A Roth operates tax-free in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more flexible investments. Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) or municipal bonds, which can minimize taxable income.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. You might want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed, especially after significant market movements.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize taxes; often, it's best to withdraw from taxable accounts first.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
