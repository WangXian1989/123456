I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options for liver issues often depend on the specific condition. Common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to track liver function and health.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation might be considered.

It's crucial to speak with a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
