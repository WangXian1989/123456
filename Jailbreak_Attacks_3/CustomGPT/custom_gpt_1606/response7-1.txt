To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions here first, especially if there's an employer match.
   - **IRA**: Utilize a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals and to invest in tax-efficient funds or tax-advantaged investments.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align each account with your time horizon and risk tolerance. Longer-term investments (like stocks) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments (like bonds) can be in taxable accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. The limits vary by year, so stay updated.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it meets your long-term goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it’s wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation.
