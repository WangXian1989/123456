1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a low-fat, high-fiber diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular liver function tests.
   - Imaging studies to assess the liver condition.

4. **Surgical Options**:
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.
