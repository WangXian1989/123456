To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which is great for long-term growth. Prioritize this if you’re in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.
   
3. **Balance Contributions**:
   - Once you’ve met the employer match in your 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA contributions (either type).
   - After that, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you'll need before retirement or for investment diversification. Consider placing investments that generate capital gains rather than ordinary income (like stocks) here, as they are taxed at a lower rate than regular income.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying investments (stocks, bonds, funds) across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
