To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize maximizing that match.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax deferral on contributions. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement but require after-tax contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While these don't have the same tax advantages, they offer more flexibility with withdrawals and investment options.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Mix different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Use tax-efficient investment strategies in taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, favor tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) to lower your current tax burden.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing more to Roth IRAs.

4. **Allocate for Short- and Long-term Goals**:
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or needs, given their liquidity.
   - Maximize retirement accounts for long-term growth.

5. **Review Contributions Regularly**:
   - Adjust your contributions based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

By adhering to these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that optimizes your investments and prepares you for the future.
