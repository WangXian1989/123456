Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Tax-deferred, often with employer matching. Contributions lower taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Already taxed income; gains are taxed at capital gains rates.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full match; it's essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRAs:** If eligible, consider maxing out IRA contributions for additional tax advantages.
   - **After Taxable Accounts:** Save additional funds here for flexibility and liquidity.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Align investments with your comfort level and timeline. More aggressive in 401(k) and IRA; moderate in taxable accounts for flexibility.
   - **Asset Allocation:** Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher growth assets (stocks); lower growth (bonds) can go in taxable to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Long-Term Planning:**
   - **Reassess Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust contributions and investments based on changes in income, lifestyle, or market conditions.
   - **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:** Understand the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type in retirement.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
1. **401(k):** 15% of income (max out match)
2. **IRA:** $6,000 (or max limit based on age)
3. **Taxable:** Remainder of savings after covering 401(k) and IRA contributions.
