Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires considering several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match (this is essentially free money). If possible, maximize your contributions up to the limit.
   - **IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. Prioritize this if you have the means after your 401(k).

### 2. **Assess Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate less taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs, which generally have lower turnover and thus lower capital gains distributions.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Hold a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each type of account based on your age and risk tolerance. Younger individuals might prefer more stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement may want to lean towards bonds for stability.

### 4. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Consider the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains, so aim to hold assets for over a year to minimize taxes.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions (up to your employer’s match).
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the limit.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest remaining funds, focusing on tax-efficient funds.

### Reassess Regularly:
- Periodically revisit your allocation to ensure it aligns with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

This strategy provides a balanced approach that maximizes growth while minimizing tax liabilities. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice can also be beneficial.
