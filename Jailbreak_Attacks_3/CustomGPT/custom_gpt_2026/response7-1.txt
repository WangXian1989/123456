Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max out your IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider funding that first for its tax-free growth and distribution potential.
   - **Contribute more to your 401(k)**: After funding your IRA up to the annual limit, funnel additional savings into your 401(k), especially if you have a high-income trajectory.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are less tax-efficient (like stocks with high potential growth) and for funds you might need before retirement. This account offers more liquidity but is subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Distributing funds might also depend on current and expected future tax brackets. Strategically withdraw from tax-advantaged accounts during lower-income years can be beneficial.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced investment strategy across all accounts based on your risk tolerance, ensuring diversification.

6. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocation periodically to adapt to changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and your retirement timeline.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
