Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income. Ideal for higher-income years.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient funds in easily accessible accounts before heavily investing.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments to manage risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate high taxable income. Capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate when held long-term.

6. **Retirement Timeline**: Adjust your contributions based on how far you are from retirement. The closer you get, the more conservative your investments may need to be.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation in each account to stay aligned with your financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring a strategy to your specific financial situation can provide personalized guidance.

Ultimately, your distribution strategy should align with your retirement goals, risk tolerance, and expected timeline.
