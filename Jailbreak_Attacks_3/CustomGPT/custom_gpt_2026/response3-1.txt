Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRAs:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k):** If you can still contribute after maxing the IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for savings goals with shorter time horizons. They also provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:** Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified (mix of stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Tax Considerations:** Consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and more stable or income-generating investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

7. **Rebalance Regularly:** Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
