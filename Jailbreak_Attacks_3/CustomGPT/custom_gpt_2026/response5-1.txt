When considering how to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to think about your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. Focus on Tax Advantages:
- **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions. This is especially valuable if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

### 3. Taxable Accounts:
- Use these accounts for funds that you might need access to before retirement. Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. Consider Asset Allocation:
- Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and timelines. Over time, rebalance as your needs and market conditions change.

### 5. Follow Your Tax Strategy:
- Withdraw from accounts in a tax-efficient manner during retirement, usually starting from taxable accounts, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts.

### Final Thoughts:
Consult a financial advisor for a strategy tailored to your specific situation and goals.
