Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Consider maxing it out if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your income and tax situation).

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Use this account for shorter-term goals or after maximizing retirement contributions.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place more aggressive investments (higher risk, potential for higher returns) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) because they grow without immediate tax implications.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments.

4. **Overall Balance**:
   - Regularly rebalance your investments based on market conditions and personal goals.

5. **Tax Planning**:
   - Consider your tax bracket now and expected future bracket; this can influence whether a Roth or traditional account is best for you.
