Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. **Assess Your Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for investments with high growth potential, as these can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts if you anticipate needing the money within the next few years.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that yield long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - **401(k) and IRA Withdrawals**: Be mindful of the tax implications when withdrawing funds, especially if planning to retire early.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **Max out your 401(k)** to the match level.
- **Contribute to your IRA** (if eligible).
- **Use taxable accounts** for additional investments as needed, especially for flexibility.

### 4. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Keep track of your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on life changes, tax law changes, or investment performance.
