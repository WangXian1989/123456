Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines to help you allocate your funds effectively:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often offers employer matches and has higher contribution limits but typically has limited investment choices.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Provides tax advantages; Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth while Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** More flexible, as you can access funds without penalties, but they are subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

### 2. **Consider Your Age and Retirement Timeline:**
   - **Younger Investors:** Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - **Approaching Retirement:** Consider reducing risk in these accounts and gradually shifting some investments to taxable accounts for easier access.

### 3. **Maximize Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Try to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 4. **Balance Risk and Liquidity:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Keep a portion of your portfolio in less risky investments for liquidity needs.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Consider higher-risk investments since you won't need to access this money until retirement.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess and Rebalance:**
   - Review and adjust your allocations annually to align with changing financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that helps you maximize your retirement savings while minimizing taxes. If you have specific goals or concerns, it might also be useful to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
