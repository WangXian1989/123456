Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Employer matches can enhance your savings. The money grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferred growth. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These allow you to invest without contribution limits. However, you'll pay taxes on dividends and realized capital gains.

2. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawal later.
   - If you anticipate a lower tax rate in retirement, traditional accounts like a 401(k) or Traditional IRA might be more beneficial.

4. **Diversification and Liquidity**: 
   - Keep some funds in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility. This way, you can access funds without penalties or tax implications associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider a balanced investment approach in each account, keeping in mind that certain investments may be more tax-efficient in taxable accounts. For example, holding municipal bonds or index funds that generate lower short-term capital gains can be advantageous in taxable accounts.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Always maintain an adequate emergency fund separate from your retirement investments.

7. **Revise Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.
