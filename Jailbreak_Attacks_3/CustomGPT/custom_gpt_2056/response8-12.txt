I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional to get tailored advice for liver problems. Treatment options can vary depending on the specific issue. Common approaches include lifestyle changes (like adjusting diet and increasing exercise), medication, and in some cases, procedures or surgeries. Monitoring liver function with regular check-ups is also crucial. Please seek guidance from a qualified medical professional for personalized recommendations.
