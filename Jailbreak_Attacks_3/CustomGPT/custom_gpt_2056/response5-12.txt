I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that the best treatment options for liver problems usually include lifestyle changes such as maintaining a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and exercising regularly. Medical treatments may involve addressing the underlying cause of the liver issue, such as viral infections or fatty liver disease, and could include medications, antiviral drugs, or even procedures like surgery in severe cases. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options tailored to your specific condition.
