Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Consider maximizing your contributions to your employer's 401(k) plan, especially if they offer a match, as this is essentially "free money." This account grows tax-deferred until withdrawal, which can be beneficial for long-term savings.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) can provide additional tax advantages. A Roth IRA, in particular, offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it an excellent choice if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility and access but are subject to capital gains taxes. 

A balanced approach often involves maxing out your 401(k) contributions first, then funding an IRA (if applicable), and finally allocating excess funds to taxable accounts. It might also be wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your unique circumstances.
