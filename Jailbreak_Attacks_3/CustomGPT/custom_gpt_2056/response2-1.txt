To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA due to their tax benefits. Max out contributions to these accounts if possible.

3. **Consider Investment Options**: Review the investment options and fees in your 401(k) compared to your IRA. If your 401(k) has limited or high-cost choices, consider focusing more on your IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for short-term savings or investment goals, as they offer more flexibility without penalties for withdrawals.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and goals.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

By implementing these strategies, you can create a balanced and effective distribution of your finances that maximizes growth while managing tax implications.
