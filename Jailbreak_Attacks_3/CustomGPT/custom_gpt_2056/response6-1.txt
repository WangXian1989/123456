To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation for more tax-advantaged growth.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If your goal is long-term, focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA for tax-advantaged growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals, where you may need liquidity.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify across different asset classes to minimize risk, adjusting the mix based on the account type:
     - 401(k) and IRAs: Consider more aggressive investments.
     - Taxable accounts: Favor more stable, less tax-inefficient investments to manage capital gains.

4. **Withdrawals and Access**:
   - Plan for retirement withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts first to potentially lower your taxable income, followed by taxable accounts for more immediate needs.

Review your specific financial circumstances and consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your needs.
