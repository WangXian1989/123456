To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the employer match, prioritize contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. 

3. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50+) and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50+).

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Funds in a 401(k) and traditional IRA grow tax-deferred, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Taxable accounts don’t offer the same tax advantages, but can provide flexibility.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to optimize growth and minimize risks. 

6. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon**: If you’re far from retirement, you might take on more risks in the 401(k) and IRA. For taxable accounts, consider more liquid investments as these can be accessed without penalties.

7. **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to maintain consistency and take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

8. **Review Periodically**: Reassess your asset allocation and contributions at least annually to ensure they align with your retirement goals and market conditions.

Lastly, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
