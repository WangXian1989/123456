The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to maximize that match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Consider the investment options available within your 401(k) and the fees associated with them.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) based on your current and expected future tax rate.
   - Contribute to an IRA to take advantage of tax benefits if you have additional funds after your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for investments that might generate regular income (like bonds or dividend stocks) which could be taxed at higher rates.
   - Taxable accounts offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

### Suggested Approach:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with your 401(k) until you reach the match, then contribute to your IRA, and finally, allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts.
- **Diversify Investments**: Consider diversifying your portfolio across these accounts to balance growth and taxable income.
- **Regularly Review**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on market conditions or changes in your financial situation.

It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for a personalized plan tailored to your specific circumstances.
