Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts efficiently depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some best practices to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After securing the employer match, focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. For 2024, you can contribute up to $22,500 to your 401(k) (or $30,000 if you’re over 50) and up to $6,500 to your IRA (or $7,500 if you’re over 50).

3. **Choose Between Traditional and Roth Accounts**: If eligible, determine whether a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA is more beneficial based on your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement. Traditional accounts offer tax deductions now, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Consider Investment Options**: Look at the investment choices available in your 401(k) compared to your IRA and taxable accounts. 401(k) plans may have limited options, while IRAs typically provide a broader range of investments. If your 401(k) has high fees or limited choices, consider using your IRA for more diverse investments.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Maintain some funds in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility. They allow for easier access to cash and you can invest in various assets without contribution limits. Just remember that investment gains will be subject to capital gains tax.

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**: When planning for withdrawals in retirement, consider the tax implications. In most cases, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k)), and finally tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA) to minimize taxable income over time.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. This helps maintain your desired level of risk over time.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Lastly, consider consulting with a financial planner who can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to enhance your long-term wealth and retirement readiness.
