Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Focus on Growth**: Since 401(k) accounts grow tax-deferred, you might want to prioritize investments with higher growth potential, like stocks, especially if you have a long time until retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: With a Traditional IRA, you can reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversification**: Consider holding different asset classes in your IRA for balanced growth. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, based on your risk tolerance.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Use taxable accounts for savings goals that are sooner rather than later. This gives you easier access to funds without early withdrawal penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider investing in index funds or ETFs, which generally have lower turnover and tax implications. Municipal bonds can also be a tax-efficient choice.

### General Tips:
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes within each account type, adjusting based on your risk tolerance and timeline.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations regularly to maintain your desired asset mix, especially after significant market moves.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial planner to create a personalized strategy tailored to your unique financial situation.

Ultimately, the best approach is one that aligns with your individual financial goals and risk tolerance.
