Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) for tax benefits.
   - **401(k)**: If you're already getting the match, aim to maximize your 401(k) contributions next.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income today, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type, you may have tax advantages now (Traditional) or in retirement (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax on earnings, so they are often used for more immediate needs or long-term investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain an adequate emergency fund in a liquid form before allocating significant amounts into retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Consider how to diversify investments within these accounts to balance risk according to your age and risk tolerance.

Regularly review and adjust your strategy based on changes in your financial situation or goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your circumstances.
