Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; consider maxing out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that produce favorable tax treatment such as ETFs or index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Bond Investments**: Favor tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) for bonds, due to their lower tax efficiency.

### 3. **Balance Risk and Accessibility**
   - **Short-term Needs**: Keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts for emergencies or near-term goals.
   - **Long-term Growth**: Place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to grow without immediate tax consequences.

### 4. **Regularly Reassess Your Distribution**
   - Periodically review and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, or your financial goals.

### 5. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively and improve returns.

This balanced approach helps maximize growth while minimizing tax burdens on your investments.
