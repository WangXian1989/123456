Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. 

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains taxes (e.g., index funds, ETFs) since they will be taxed at your income rate when sold.

### 3. **Investment Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Ensure your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance, particularly in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Diversification:** Utilize different asset classes to spread risk across accounts.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan withdrawals to minimize tax impacts, prioritizing tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) in retirement.

### Summary:
- **Contribute to 401(k) up to the match**
- **Max out IRAs, if possible**
- **Use taxable accounts for lower-tax investments**
  
This structured approach helps you maximize growth while minimizing taxes. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
