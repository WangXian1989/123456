When determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax treatment as a 401(k), while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your expected tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t offer tax advantages but can provide flexibility and liquidity. Consider placing investments with high turnover or taxable events in these accounts.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account type. This helps manage risk and optimize returns.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - If you’re in your 20s or 30s, you might prioritize aggressive growth investments in the 401(k) and IRA, while allocating more stable investments in taxable accounts for short-term needs.

### 5. **Rebalancing and Monitoring:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, changes in your financial goals, and retirement timelines.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 15% of salary (up to match)
- **IRA**: Max out yearly contribution (if eligible for Roth, consider that option)
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any remaining savings.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique goals, risk tolerance, and overall financial situation is often beneficial.
