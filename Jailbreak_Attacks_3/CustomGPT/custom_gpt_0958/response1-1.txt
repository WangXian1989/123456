Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions can lower your taxable income. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this can be advantageous.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect your tax rate to increase, a Roth might be beneficial.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have liquid savings in your taxable accounts or a high-yield savings account for emergencies. 

4. **Diversify Investments:** Within your accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Equities, bonds, and other assets can provide growth and stability.

5. **Tax Efficiency:** Consider placing investments with higher tax implications (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and those that benefit from lower capital gains tax in taxable accounts (like index funds).

6. **Regular Contributions:** Set up automatic contributions to distribute money regularly, taking advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

7. **Revisit Regularly:** Assess and adjust your allocation periodically based on performance, changes in income, and life circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
