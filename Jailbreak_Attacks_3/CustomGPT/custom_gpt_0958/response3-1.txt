Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by funding your 401(k) up to the employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account or similar liquid asset.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts for more flexible access to funds. Consider municipal bonds or tax-efficient funds to minimize tax liability.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to manage risk.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your portfolio and adjust contributions based on performance, changes in income, or shifts in life circumstances.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific goals and situation.
