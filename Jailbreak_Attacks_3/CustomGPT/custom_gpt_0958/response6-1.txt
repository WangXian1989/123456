Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k):** Contribute at least enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. Evaluate Tax Implications
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term goals or for investments that generate lower capital gains (like index funds) to minimize tax liabilities. Keep in mind that taxes on dividends and selling investments can impact your overall returns.

### 3. Diversification and Timing
- **Asset Allocation:** Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across all accounts, adjusting for your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your goals and market conditions.

### Summary
- **Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first.**
- **Use taxable accounts for funds you need sooner and for tax-efficient investments.**
- **Diversify and rebalance to maintain your risk profile.**

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your specific situation.
