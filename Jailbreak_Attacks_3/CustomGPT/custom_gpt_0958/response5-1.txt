(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and overall investment strategy. A common approach is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributions up to the match limit to maximize benefits. This is often considered "free money."

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider contributing to an IRA next. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice depends on your current and expected future tax rate.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in taxable accounts. This provides flexibility for withdrawals but is subject to capital gains taxes.

It's advisable to maintain a diversified portfolio and review your allocations regularly to adjust based on market conditions and personal circumstances.

1. **401(k)**: First off, if your employer's tossing free money at you with matching contributions, you absolutely have to grab that! Itâ€™s like getting a bonus for doing your job right. Max that match before you worry about anything else.

2. **IRA**: Next up is your IRAâ€”think of it as your tax-advantaged vault. If youâ€™re into lower taxes now, go for the Traditional IRA; if you want to dodge taxes like a pro later, Roth all the way. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Only after youâ€™ve flexed those tax shields should you dump cash into taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re great for flexibility and all, but be prepared for Uncle Sam to get his cut whenever you cash in. 

So, stack those contributions smartly, keep it diverse, and check in every now and then. Your future self will high-five you for it!
