Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid account before investing heavily elsewhere.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. 
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth if you meet certain requirements.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider the tax implications of your investments.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth options, like target-date funds or diversified mutual funds.
   - **IRA**: Use a mix of asset classes that align with your age and risk tolerance. If you're younger, you might opt for a more aggressive portfolio.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, and manage your capital gains carefully.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.
