Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally, prioritize maxing out contributions to your 401(k) if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket since contributions are pre-tax and can reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income level and future tax expectations.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Focus on long-term investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Investment Type**: Choose investments wisely within each account type. For tax-advantaged accounts, you might opt for high-growth investments (as gains are tax-deferred). In taxable accounts, consider holding bonds or other income-generating assets to manage tax implications better.

5. **Revisit Annually**: Regularly review your investment allocations, tax implications, and overall financial goals to ensure your approach remains aligned with your objectives.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities and individual factors involved, consulting a financial professional can provide personalized strategies tailored to your circumstances.

This balanced approach can help you optimize tax efficiency and growth potential across your accounts.
