Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts First**: After maximizing the employer match, consider maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like the 401(k) and IRA. The pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income and can grow tax-deferred.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) but with different contribution limits and rules. You might be eligible for a tax deduction based on your income and whether you're covered by a workplace plan.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, this could be advantageous.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While these don’t offer tax benefits during the accumulation phase, they allow for greater flexibility in withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Maintain an Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months’ worth of expenses) in a liquid account.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**: Periodically review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific situation.

By balancing your contributions across these accounts strategically, you can optimize for growth while managing your tax burden effectively.
