Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by fully maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts provide tax advantages that can lead to significant savings over time. The 401(k) may have employer matching contributions, so ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.

2. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement or in the future, consider using a Roth IRA (if eligible) or contributing after-tax dollars to your 401(k) if your plan allows. This allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Time Horizon**: Funds in your 401(k) and IRA should be invested for the long-term, as they can grow tax-deferred, while money in taxable accounts may be needed sooner. Depending on your timeline for needing funds, adjust your asset allocation accordingly.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a well-diversified portfolio across all account types. This can help manage risk and improve potential returns. Be mindful of the tax implications of your investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Generally, it may be more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like your 401(k) and traditional IRAs), and lastly from Roth accounts, allowing those to grow longer.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and market conditions change. Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this general advice to your specific circumstances.
