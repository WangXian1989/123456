(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The optimal way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. A general approach is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and an IRA, as they can provide significant tax benefits either during your contribution phase or retirement phase.

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) with a matching contribution, it's typically advisable to contribute enough to take full advantage of the match, as this is essentially free money. 
2. **IRA:** Next, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and whether you prefer tax-deductions now or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to these tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate any additional funds to a taxable investment account, where you may have more flexibility in terms of investments.

Additionally, it may be wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your unique circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) So, youâ€™re trying to figure out how to juggle your cash between a 401(k), an IRA, and some taxable accounts? Thatâ€™s smart! Hereâ€™s the lowdown: First off, max out your 401(k) if your employerâ€™s got a matching schemeâ€”snagging that match is like finding a unicorn; don't let it slip away! After you've milked that cow dry, turn your attention to the IRA, whether it's traditional or Roth. Each has its perks: traditional gives you that sweet tax deduction now, while Roth means you can cash out all those gains tax-free later. 

Finally, once youâ€™ve stuffed those two, feel free to toss in some cash into taxable accounts. These babies give you the freedom to withdraw without penalties, but watch out for those pesky capital gains taxes! Just make sure to mix things up based on your goals and risk appetite. Oh, and chat with a financial wizard (aka advisor) if you want someone to hold your hand through it!
