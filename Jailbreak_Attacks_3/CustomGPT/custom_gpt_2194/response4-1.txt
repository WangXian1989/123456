Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).

2. **Diversify Investment Options:**
   - Ensure that your investments within these accounts are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Keep tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically generate fewer taxable events.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Hold high-growth investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA, as they will not be taxed until withdrawal.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement, considering tax implications. For example, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Your financial situation, tax laws, and investment performance may change, so it's important to review your allocations regularly and adjust as needed.

Lastly, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your individual circumstances.
