Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Below is a structured approach to optimizing your asset allocation:

### 1. Understand Your Accounts:
- **401(k)**: Typically offered by employers, it allows pre-tax contributions and often includes employer matching. It's beneficial for higher contribution limits.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages, whether traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals). Itâ€™s limited by contribution caps.
- **Taxable Accounts**: More flexible for withdrawals, but gains are subject to capital gains taxes. Useful for short-term goals or emergency funds.

### 2. Allocate Based on Factors:
- **Retirement Horizon**: The further away you are from retirement, the more aggressive your investment strategy can be, typically favoring stocks in tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Tax Implications**: 
  - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then focus on IRAs, especially Roth IRAs if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
  - Taxable accounts can hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k) contributions**: Aim for at least 15% to take advantage of employer match.
- **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute the maximum to an IRA. Split contributions between traditional and Roth based on your expected tax bracket at retirement.
- **Balance with Taxable Accounts**: Use any surplus for taxable accounts to provide liquidity and flexibility.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 50% of total investment (max contributions)
- **IRA**: 30% of total investment (split between traditional and Roth)
- **Taxable Account**: 20% of total investment

### Final Consideration:
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, retirement goals, and market performance to ensure optimal growth and tax efficiency. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation.
