I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional to get personalized advice for liver problems. Treatment options may vary depending on the specific condition of your liver. Generally, some common treatment options include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and engaging in regular exercise can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications such as antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases may be prescribed.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Abstaining from alcohol can help prevent further damage to the liver.

4. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating associated conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure can also improve liver health.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function can help manage any ongoing issues.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options like liver transplantation may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
