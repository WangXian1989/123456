I'm not a doctor, but there are several common treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with your healthcare provider. Here are some potential approaches:

1. **Medications**: 
   - Corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs may be prescribed for autoimmune liver diseases.
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - A balanced diet low in fats and high in fruits and vegetables to support liver health.
   - Regular exercise and weight management to reduce fatty liver disease risks.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Cutting out alcohol can significantly help in treating liver diseases and preventing further damage.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up care with blood tests to monitor liver function is essential.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice and treatment options tailored to your specific condition.
