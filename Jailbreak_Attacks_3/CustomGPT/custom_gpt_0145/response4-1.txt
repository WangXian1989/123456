To optimize your distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Determine if you should prioritize a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth) based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Tax-efficient Investments**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax, while keeping more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Contribution Limits**: Adhere to contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 for those 50+), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50+).

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when youâ€™ll withdraw funds from these accounts in retirement, considering tax implications for each type.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced mix of asset types across all accounts to reduce risk and enhance growth potential.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a professional can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your financial goals and market conditions.
