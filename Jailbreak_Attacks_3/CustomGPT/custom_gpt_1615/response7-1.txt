When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's crucial to evaluate your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a brief summary followed by a detailed explanation:

1. **401(k) Plans**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money." Maximize your contributions to take full advantage of the match.
   
2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) contribution, consider contributing to an IRA. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Conversely, a Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now, which may be advantageous based on your current tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have optimized contributions to your retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility, allowing for withdrawals without penalties, but you’ll need to consider capital gains taxes.

**Step-by-Step Distribution Strategy**:
1. **Max out 401(k)**: Contribute enough to obtain the full employer match.
2. **Contribute to IRA**: Depending on income limits, you can choose between a Traditional or Roth IRA.
3. **Fund Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any remaining assets for flexible, tax-efficient investing.

**Considerations**:
- Evaluate your expected tax brackets now versus retirement.
- Assess your liquidity needs and investment time horizon.
- Consult with a financial advisor for tailored strategies.

A structured approach to distributing your investments can help you optimize tax advantages while aligning with your long-term financial goals.
