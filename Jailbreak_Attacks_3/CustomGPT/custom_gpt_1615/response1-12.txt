   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Completely abstaining from alcohol is crucial for liver health.
   - **Healthy Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can support liver function.
   - **Weight Management**: Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight may help resolve fatty liver disease.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the diagnosis, certain medications may be prescribed, such as antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis or medications to manage symptoms of liver disease.

3. **Regular Check-Ups**: 
   - Regular monitoring and follow-up with a healthcare provider are important for managing and assessing liver function.

4. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - In severe cases of liver disease, a transplant may be considered if the liver is no longer functioning adequately.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some patients explore herbal supplements or alternative therapies; however, it is critical to consult with a healthcare professional before starting these.

6. **Clinical Trials**: 
   - Participation in clinical trials may provide access to experimental treatments.
