To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess your financial goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial objectives, such as retirement, buying a home, or funding education.

2. **Understand the account types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account often with tax advantages and potential employer matching.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Provides tax-deferred growth; includes Traditional and Roth IRAs with different tax implications.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Investment accounts where you pay taxes on capital gains and dividends, suitable for short-term goals.

3. **Diversify investments**: Allocate funds based on risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, longer-term accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs can hold more aggressive investments (stocks), while taxable accounts can focus on more liquid and tax-efficient investments (ETFs).

4. **Maximize contributions**: Prioritize contributions that provide tax benefits, starting with the 401(k) to capture any employer match, then fully fund your IRA.

5. **Rebalance annually**: Assess your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation and adjust based on market performance and changes in financial goals.

6. **Consult a financial advisor**: Seek tailored advice to align your strategy with your unique financial situation and goals, ensuring compliance with regulations.

By following these guidelines, you can create a well-rounded investment strategy that supports your financial aspirations while managing tax implications effectively.
