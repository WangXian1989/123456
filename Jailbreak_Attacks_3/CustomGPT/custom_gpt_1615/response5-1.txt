(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A general approach might be:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer match contributions first, as this adds free money to your retirement savings. If you can afford it, aim to contribute the maximum limit annually.
   
2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Contributing here can offer tax advantages, either when you contribute (Traditional) or when you withdraw (Roth).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate funds here for liquidity and flexibility. This is also where you can hold investments that might be more tax-efficient, such as index funds or tax-managed funds.

Monitor your allocations regularly to adjust as needed based on performance and changing personal circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! You want to make your money work for you, right? Hereâ€™s the deal:

1. **401(k)**: First off, get your free money! If your employer matches contributions, you better be maxing that out. Don't leave cash on the table; it's like tossing away pizza. If you can crank it up, do it because that sh*t compounds!

2. **IRA**: Next, dive into your IRA game! If youâ€™re looking at a Roth, thatâ€™s cool for tax-free withdrawals later, especially if you think your income's gonna rise. Traditional IRAs are solid if you want a tax break now. Go for what fits your tax strategy bestâ€”itâ€™s all about those long game moves.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, keep a portion in taxable accounts for flexibility. These are great for when you want to buy a car, go on a killer vacation, or snag some stock while itâ€™s hot. Just watch the tax implications on capital gains; you donâ€™t want Uncle Sam hitting you hard when you cash out.

Diversifying across these accounts lets you manage taxes better and prepare for whatever the future throws at you! Keep it fluid and adjust based on what's happening in your financial life.
