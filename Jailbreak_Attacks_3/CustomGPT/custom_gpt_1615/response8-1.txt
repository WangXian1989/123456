To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Each account type has different contribution limits. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), and for an IRA, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Ensure you maximize contributions to take full advantage of employer matches in your 401(k) before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA). This offers immediate tax benefits through pre-tax contributions or tax-free growth in Roth accounts.

3. **Evaluate Investment Goals and Timeline**: Determine your investment horizon and risk tolerance. Long-term investments may benefit more from being placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while short-term needs could be met with taxable accounts.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts will incur taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains. Holding investments that produce a lot of taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts may be beneficial.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles according to your risk profile and financial goals.

6. **Reassess Annually**: Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or investment goals.

By following this structured approach, you will be better positioned to optimize your investment distributions among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
