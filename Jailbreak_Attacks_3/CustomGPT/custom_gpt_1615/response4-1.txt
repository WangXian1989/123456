To effectively allocate your money among your 401(k), Individual Retirement Account (IRA), and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline:

1. **Maximize employer contributions**: If your 401(k) offers employer matching, contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Consider tax implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, which lowers your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Investment income and capital gains are subject to taxation, so consider keeping more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in these accounts.

3. **Retirement timeline**: If you are younger and further from retirement, consider allocating more to Roth accounts for tax-free growth. As you near retirement, consider shifting some assets to taxable accounts to avoid potential tax implications on withdrawals.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors, regardless of the account type.

5. **Investment goals**: Tailor your approach based on your short-term and long-term goals. For example, funds in a taxable account might be used sooner than those in retirement accounts.

6. **Debt and emergency funds**: Consider paying off high-interest debt and maintaining an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

7. **Review and adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust according to changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

A general example of distribution could be to contribute to your 401(k) up to the match, fully fund your IRA (Roth or Traditional depending on your tax strategy), and then allocate any remaining money into your taxable accounts while considering tax-efficient investments.

It is recommended to consult with a financial advisor to provide personalized strategies that align with your financial situation and goals.
