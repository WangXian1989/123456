Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—this is essentially free money. Then, consider maximizing your contributions if you can.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your income, you might want to contribute to a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. Here, consider the tax implications of investments (like capital gains) as well as your liquidity needs.

A common strategy is to prioritize contributions in the following order:
1. 401(k) to get the employer match
2. IRA (traditional or Roth)
3. Additional contributions to 401(k)
4. Taxable accounts

It’s always best to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy suited to your specific circumstances!
