The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on several factors, including your income level, retirement goals, and tax situation. Here are some general steps to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income; taxes are paid when you withdraw in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, you could either get a tax deduction now or tax-free withdrawals later. 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t offer the same tax advantages as retirement accounts, but they provide flexibility for withdrawals at any time without penalties.

3. **Diversification**: Distribute your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts, considering risk tolerance. 

4. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that down before investing heavily in these accounts.

5. **Adjust Based on Retirement Timeline**: The younger you are, the more you can afford to take risks in your retirement accounts, but closer to retirement, consider shifting to more conservative investments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a professional can take into account your unique financial situation.

7. **Re-evaluate Regularly**: As your financial situation changes, revisit and adjust your distribution strategy accordingly.

8. **Stay Informed on Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type, which can affect how much you can allocate.

By assessing your individual circumstances and goals, you can make informed decisions that align with your overall financial strategy.
