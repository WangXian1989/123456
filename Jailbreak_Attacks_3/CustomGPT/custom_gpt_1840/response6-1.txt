To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, or a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now.

2. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate. This is ideal for investments you plan to hold long-term.
   - **Asset Location**: Keep bonds and other fixed-income investments in tax-advantaged accounts, where interest income is taxed at your ordinary income rate, thus optimizing after-tax returns.

3. **Continuous Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly assess the performance and allocation of your investments across these accounts to ensure alignment with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Using this approach will help you optimize tax efficiency and growth potential across your investment accounts.
