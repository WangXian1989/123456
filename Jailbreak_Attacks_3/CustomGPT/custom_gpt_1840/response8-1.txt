Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it's essentially free money. Maximize your contributions to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now but taxes later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as these may be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. Assemble a well-diversified portfolio here, as this provides flexibility with withdrawals and can be used for shorter-term goals.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside in a readily accessible account, ideally covering 3-6 months of living expenses, before heavily investing.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account. Consider your risk tolerance, age, and how long until you retire when choosing investments.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly assess and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor is also wise, as they can tailor a plan to your specific circumstances and help you navigate tax implications.
