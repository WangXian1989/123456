Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, and your investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, whether it's a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Distributions from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, whereas qualified distributions from a Roth IRA are tax-free. Taxable accounts do not have the same tax advantages but allow more flexibility in accessing your money without penalties.

3. **Investment Options**: Your 401(k) may have limited investment options compared to a taxable account or an IRA, where you have the freedom to choose a wider variety of investments.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**: If you're nearing retirement, plan the order in which you'll withdraw from your accounts. Generally, it could be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs), and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Rebalance As Needed**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

Each person's circumstances are unique, so tailor these suggestions to your individual situation to optimize your financial strategy.
