Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money." The 401(k) has tax advantages, allowing your investment to grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA Accounts**: Next, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), whether traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial, as your withdrawals will be tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer greater flexibility for withdrawals, but keep in mind that investment gains may be subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Asset Allocation**: It's essential to maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher tax rates on interest income.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on market conditions and life changes, such as retirement or necessary withdrawals.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also a wise step to tailor this strategy to your specific needs. 

As a rule of thumb, aim to maximize your tax-advantaged contributions first and use taxable accounts as a secondary option for additional flexibility.
