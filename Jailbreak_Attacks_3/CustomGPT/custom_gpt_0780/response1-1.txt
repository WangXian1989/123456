The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines that might help you make your decision:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, consider contributing enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Maximize your contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA based on your tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs can give you immediate tax deductions.
   - If you’re eligible, aim to maximize your annual contribution limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After contributing to retirement accounts, consider allocating money to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize tax liabilities on capital gains.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively. 

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - Your age and how long you have until retirement will influence how aggressively you should invest in your 401(k) and IRA.

6. **Tax Implications:**
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of each account type when making withdrawals in retirement. 

It’s often a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can offer personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
