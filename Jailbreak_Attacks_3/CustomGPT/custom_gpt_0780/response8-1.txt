To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, whether it’s a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure you have a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

3. **Balance Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts are tax-advantaged. Traditional accounts offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Focus on growth-oriented investments in these accounts, as capital gains aren’t taxed until you withdraw.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate dividends or interest, which can be taxed at a higher rate. Favor investments like index funds or ETFs, which are more tax-efficient in taxable accounts due to lower turnover.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals carefully. In retirement, you might want to withdraw from your taxable accounts first to let your tax-advantaged accounts grow for a longer period, but optimize for your tax bracket in any given year.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired level of risk and return.

6. **Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your financial situation, long-term goals, and tax implications.

Every individual's situation is unique, so it's essential to take your personal financial goals, risks, and timelines into account when distributing your money.
