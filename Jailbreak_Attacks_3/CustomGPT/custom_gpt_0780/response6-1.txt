When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic approaches:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Max out your IRA contributions (both traditional and Roth, if eligible) due to their tax benefits.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - Consider your current tax bracket and project future income levels. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Hold more volatile and higher growth investments in your tax-advantaged accounts, where growth is tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - Use your taxable accounts for safer, income-generating investments such as bonds, which may benefit from a lower tax rate on long-term capital gains.

4. **Rebalancing Strategy:**
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level across all accounts.
   - Pay attention to the tax implications of selling investments within taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

This multifaceted approach ensures long-term growth while maximizing tax efficiency.
