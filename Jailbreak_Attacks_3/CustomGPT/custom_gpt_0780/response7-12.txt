I'm not a doctor, but there are several treatment options that may be considered for liver problems, which can vary based on the specific condition (like fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, hepatitis, etc.). Generally, treatment options might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** This often includes dietary changes, increasing physical activity, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications:** Depending on the condition, there may be medications available to help manage symptoms or address underlying causes.
3. **Regular Monitoring:** Frequent check-ups can help monitor liver function and detect issues early.
4. **Procedures:** In severe cases, procedures such as liver biopsy or even a liver transplant may be necessary.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan.
