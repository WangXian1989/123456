The optimal way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your age, financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially “free money” and a great start to your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match first and consider maxing out your contribution if you're in your 30s or 40s. This account grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if eligibility criteria are met.

3. **Consider Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect your tax rate in retirement to be lower, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) could be more beneficial. Conversely, if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket upon retirement, a Roth account might be sensible.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), direct any additional money to a taxable brokerage account. This allows for greater flexibility in withdrawals, but capital gains tax will apply.

5. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Before investing in any account, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of living expenses.

6. **Diversification**: 
   - Within these accounts, ensure that your investments are well-diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

7. **Annual Review**:
   - Regularly review your allocation and adjust based on performance, life changes, or shifts in financial objectives.

Lastly, it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
