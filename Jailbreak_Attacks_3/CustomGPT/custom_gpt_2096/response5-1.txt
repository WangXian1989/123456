Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should align with your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Investment Goals**:
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Fund taxable accounts for short-term goals since withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties and taxes.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term investments that benefit from compounding and tax deferral.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Hold assets with higher expected returns (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA, as they will grow without immediate tax implications.

### 4. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon, ensuring you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Annually**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations yearly to maintain your desired asset mix, taking into account changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific circumstances.
