Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Employer-Sponsored Accounts (401(k))**:
   - **Match Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If financially feasible, contribute up to the annual limit.

### 2. **Fund an IRA**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; good for tax-deferred growth.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free; ideal for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term goals or if you reach contribution limits on tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes; invest in tax-efficient funds or consider tax-loss harvesting strategies.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **High-Growth Investments**: Place in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - **Income-Producing Investments**: Consider placing them in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains and qualified dividends rates.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Review your asset allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

### Summary:
Start by maximizing your employer-sponsored 401(k) contributions for any match, then fund your IRA, and finally allocate any remaining funds to your taxable accounts with a focus on tax efficiency. Keep your overall investment strategy aligned with your long-term financial goals.
