Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and the money grows tax-deferred. This is great if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Good if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Debt and Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in place and pay down high-interest debt before heavily investing.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Use these accounts for longer-term investments (like stocks) since they have tax benefits. 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider keeping more conservative investments or tax-efficient funds here, as capital gains and dividends are taxed annually.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### 6. **State of Retirement Accounts**
   - Check the contribution limits and ensure you’re not exceeding them, particularly for IRAs.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of income to max out employer match, then up to $22,500 (or the limit).
- **IRA**: Max out contributions ($6,500 for individuals under 50; $7,500 for those 50 and over).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest remaining funds after maxing out retirement accounts.

### Consider Professional Advice
Consult with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your specific circumstances.

### Summary
- Prioritize employer match.
- Utilize tax-advantaged accounts effectively.
- Maintain liquidity for emergencies.
- Adjust based on your investment horizon and tax situation.
