Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Pre-Tax Contributions**: Favor 401(k) and traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.
   - **After-Tax Contributions**: Opt for a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you believe your tax rate will rise.

### 3. **Diversify Assets in Taxable Accounts**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets like index funds and municipal bonds to minimize tax liability.
   - **Real Estate or Other Alternatives**: Consider diversifying with real estate investments if they align with your risk tolerance.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically assess and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and asset class exposure.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of income, focusing on employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out annual contribution (currently $6,500 under age 50, $7,500 if older).
- **Taxable Account**: Any additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Additional Tips:
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
- Stay informed about contribution limits and investment options.

By strategically allocating funds across these accounts, you can effectively manage both tax implications and long-term growth.
