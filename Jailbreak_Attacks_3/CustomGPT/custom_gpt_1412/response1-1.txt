When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to weigh. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) with a matching contribution, it's often best to contribute at least enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider the investment options and fees associated with your 401(k) plan.

2. **IRA Contributions**: 
   - Max out your contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) if you're eligible. The tax advantages can be significant. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.
   - Evaluate your current tax situation to decide between a Traditional or Roth IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can start contributing to a taxable investment account.
   - This account provides more flexibility but lacks the tax advantages of retirement accounts. Consider using tax-efficient investment strategies to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Understand the tax implications of each account type. For example, dividends and capital gains from taxable accounts can be taxed at a higher rate than the growth in a tax-advantaged account.

5. **Investment Goals and Horizon**: 
   - Consider your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Longer-term funds can be more aggressively invested, while funds needed in the short term should be more conservatively allocated.

6. **Diversification**: 
   - Within each account type, ensure a diversified investment strategy to manage risk effectively over time.

7. **Regular Review**: 
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust as necessary based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specifically for your situation. They can guide you based on your personal financial circumstances and goals.
