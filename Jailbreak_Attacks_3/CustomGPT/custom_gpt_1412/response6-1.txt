Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Here are key considerations to help guide your distribution strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider maximizing your contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. With a Traditional IRA, you may benefit from tax deductions on contributions; with a Roth IRA, you benefit from tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Tax Bracket Analysis**: Determine your current tax bracket to inform your contributions. You may choose to use pre-tax contributions (traditional accounts) if you are currently in a higher tax bracket and expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement.
   - **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how and when you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Generally, tax-efficient withdrawal strategies involve taking from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

### 3. **Evaluate Investment Options**:
   - **Investment Choices**: Assess the investment options available in each account type. Some accounts may offer better investment options with lower fees compared to others.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Choose an appropriate asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline in each account.

### 4. **Diversification**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Aim for a diversified portfolio across all your accounts to manage risk. This means spreading investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your target asset allocation.

### Summary:
- Prioritize contributing to accounts with tax advantages and employer matches.
- Analyze your tax situation to guide contributions and withdrawal strategies.
- Ensure diversification and assess the investment options available in each account.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your specific needs and goals.
