When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the ideal strategy can depend on several factors including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general approach you might consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if your budget allows it.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions (up to the company match), consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Choose based on your income level and tax situation (Traditional IRAs may provide a tax deduction now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement).

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - Think about your current tax bracket and your expected tax bracket in retirement. Contributing to a Roth IRA might be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - A Traditional IRA or 401(k) provides tax savings now but taxes are due upon withdrawal.

### 3. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts as Necessary**
   - Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts provide more liquidity and flexibility, allowing for withdrawals without penalties.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs that are less likely to generate capital gains.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all account types based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Reviewing your asset allocation regularly can help ensure you stay on track with your investment goals.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice can be invaluable. A financial advisor can help you develop a strategy that aligns with your individual situation and goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of income until you reach the employer match, then max out if possible.
- **IRA:** Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA, maxing out at $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any remaining funds in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.

This balanced approach can help you make the most of your investments while preparing effectively for retirement. Remember to adjust these strategies as your financial situation and financial goals evolve.
