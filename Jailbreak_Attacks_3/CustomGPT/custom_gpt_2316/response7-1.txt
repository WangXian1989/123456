The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and a great starting point.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. This is great for when you're in your peak earning years and can benefit from the tax deduction.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Also allows for tax-deferred growth, and you may deduct contributions from your taxes if you meet certain criteria.
   - **IRA (Roth)**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed on earnings annually, so consider placing lower-yield, longer-term investments here. 

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) are well diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

4. **Adjust Based on Age**: Younger investors may prioritize growth investments in their 401(k) and IRAs for compounding purposes, while older investors might focus on more conservative investments to preserve capital.

5. **Regularly Reassess**: As your financial situation or the market changes, continue to reassess your distribution strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, a professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.

Overall, it's essential to create a balanced strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
