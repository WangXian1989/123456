I'm not a doctor, but itâ€™s essential to consult a healthcare professional who can evaluate your specific condition. General options for liver treatment may include lifestyle changes, medication, and in severe cases, procedures or surgery. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver problem, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or slow disease progression. For example, antiviral drugs for hepatitis or medications for fatty liver disease.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Regular visits to your healthcare provider for monitoring liver function tests.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures may be necessary, including liver biopsy, to assess the extent of liver damage, or in extreme cases, liver transplantation.

Always seek personalized medical advice for the best treatment for your condition.
