When considering how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some key factors to consider:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth but have rules on withdrawal timing. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, but also offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs, as exceeding these can result in penalties. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (plus a $7,500 catch-up for those over 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (plus a $1,000 catch-up).

3. **Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to secure the full match, as this is essentially free money.

4. **Investment Goals and Horizon**:
   - Consider when you plan to access the funds and your investment objectives. A longer time horizon allows for riskier investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term goals may necessitate safer options in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified across different asset classes and accounts to reduce risk.

**Suggested Distribution Strategy**:
- Max out the employer match in your 401(k) first.
- Then, contribute to an IRA (choose Roth or Traditional based on your tax situation).
- After maxing IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) to increase contributions.
- Finally, if you have additional funds, consider taxable accounts for further investment, keeping in mind tax implications.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to personalize your investment strategy based on your financial situation and goals.
