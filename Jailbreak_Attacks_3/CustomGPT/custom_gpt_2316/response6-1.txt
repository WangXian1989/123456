To assess the best strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including tax implications, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Below is a strategic approach to guide your distribution:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money" which should always be maximized first.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate capital gains, dividends, or interest payments, as the tax implications will differ compared to tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: In taxable accounts, consider using losses to offset gains, which can minimize your overall tax burden.

3. **Investment Goals and Timeline**:
   - **Short-term Goals**: Fund these through taxable accounts to ensure liquidity without penalties.
   - **Long-term Goals**: Focus on maxing out 401(k) and IRA contributions as these accounts can grow tax-deferred or tax-free, aligning with longer investment horizons.

### Conclusion
By strategically allocating your funds, you can optimize growth and minimize taxes. Prioritize maximizing contributions in tax-advantaged accounts, account for potential tax liabilities in taxable accounts, and align your investments with your financial goals and timelines for maximum efficiency. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
