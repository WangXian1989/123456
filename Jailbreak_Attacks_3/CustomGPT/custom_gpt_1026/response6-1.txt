To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money. Consider contributing the maximum allowed if you can.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Contribute the maximum allowable amount annually.

2. **Balance and Diversify**:
   - Distribute your investments based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals. Use a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts to achieve optimal diversification.
   - Keep in mind that taxable accounts do not offer tax advantages but can provide liquidity and flexibility. Consider keeping more tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs here.

3. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio according to changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals. This may involve shifting assets between accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy before retirement. Generally, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow as long as possible.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize growth and minimize taxes.
