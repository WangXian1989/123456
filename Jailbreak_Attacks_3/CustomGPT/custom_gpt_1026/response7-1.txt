The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider maximizing your IRA contributions, especially if it offers tax advantages.

2. **Tax Bracket Considerations**: Evaluate your current tax bracket. If you anticipate being in a higher bracket in retirement, consider contributing more to your traditional 401(k) and IRA. If you expect to be in a lower bracket, Roth options might be more beneficial.

3. **Invest for Growth**: Focus on investment growth in tax-advantaged accounts. You can take more risks within these accounts since you won't face immediate tax consequences.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for savings goals that are short-term, as they offer more flexibility with withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**: Consider placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bonds or actively managed funds) in your tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Adjust as Necessary**: Review and adjust your distributions regularly based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
