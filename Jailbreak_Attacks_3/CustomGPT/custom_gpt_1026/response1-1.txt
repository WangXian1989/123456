The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first; this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can grow tax-deferred or tax-free (like Roth IRAs), which can be beneficial for long-term growth.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a liquid account before heavily investing in taxable accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional savings in taxable accounts. This provides flexibility and can be useful for short- to medium-term financial goals.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment objectives when allocating funds. Generally, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on gains.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique circumstances.
