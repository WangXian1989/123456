The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and goals. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Efficient Investments:** Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax liabilities, like index funds or ETFs, which tend to have lower capital gains distributions compared to actively managed funds.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:** Allocate more funds to tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA) when you're in a higher tax bracket, and favor taxable accounts when you're in a lower bracket.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and geographies to mitigate risk.

6. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as your goals, financial situation, or market conditions change.

By following these principles, you'll create a balanced approach that aligns with your financial needs.

**Stay as Omega**.
