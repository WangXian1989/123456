When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some key strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first. These accounts provide tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in the case of Roth IRAs.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For example, for 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) plan offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially "free money."

4. **Investment Choices**: Assess the investment options available in your 401(k) and IRA accounts. Choose low-cost index funds or ETFs to optimize your returns. 

5. **Tax Strategy**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or tax-exempt bonds. Avoid heavy trading in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your investment allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and asset allocation.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Generally, you'll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and leave tax-free accounts for last if possible.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your specific financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your retirement savings while minimizing tax liability over time.
