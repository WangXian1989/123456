When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these core principles:

1. **Take Advantage of Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Maximize any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Contributions are pre-tax, which means your taxable income is lower.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

2. **Consider Investment Options**:
   - **401(k)** plans often have limited investment choices, so if you have better options in your IRA, you might want to prioritize funding that account.
   - Evaluate the fees associated with each account type, as lower fees can translate to better long-term growth.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate high short-term capital gains or dividends (e.g., individual stocks) since they’re taxed at ordinary income rates.
   - Hold tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, in taxable accounts to minimize taxable distributions.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these accounts. Aim for 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Growth vs. Preservation**:
   - In the 401(k) and IRA, focus more on growth-oriented investments because you won’t need this money until retirement. 
   - If you anticipate needing funds prior to retirement, keep more liquid and conservative investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Long-Term Strategy**:
   - Regularly reassess and adjust your investment allocations based on changes in financial situations, tax laws, and retirement goals. 

Ultimately, splitting your contributions strategically across these accounts can optimize your tax situation and maximize your retirement savings. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice!
