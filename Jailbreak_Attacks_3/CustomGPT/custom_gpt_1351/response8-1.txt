The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income now. Withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income (like bonds or certain mutual funds) or for short-term goals. Capital gains tax rates can be lower than ordinary income tax rates, especially for long-term holdings.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and account types to manage risk effectively.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, plan your withdrawal strategy considering tax implications. Typically, withdrawals from taxable accounts are made first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA), and last, tax-free accounts (Roth IRA).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax implications and investment strategies, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific situation.

Balancing these accounts effectively can help maximize your retirement savings and minimize taxes over time.
