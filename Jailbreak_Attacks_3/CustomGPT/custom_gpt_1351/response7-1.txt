To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match, prioritize your tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket upon retirement, a Traditional IRA might be more beneficial.
   - **401(k)**: Continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This offers tax deferral, lowering your taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, invest any additional funds in taxable accounts. Here, focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment strategy is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and geographies, regardless of the account type.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for withdrawals in retirement, considering the tax implications of each account type. Taxable accounts may be tapped into last to allow for tax-free growth in retirement accounts.
