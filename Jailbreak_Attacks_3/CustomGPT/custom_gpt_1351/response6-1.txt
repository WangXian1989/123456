Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often has higher contribution limits and possible employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages, with traditional IRAs providing tax deductions and Roth IRAs offering tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility to access funds without penalties, but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match as it's essentially "free money."
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA for the tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional contributions after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Keep investments that grow rapidly in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Income**: Hold lower-growth investments, like bonds or dividend stocks, in taxable accounts to manage capital gains effectively.

### 4. **Assess Your Goals and Timeline**
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts for emergencies or shorter-term goals.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on growth investments in your 401(k) and IRA aimed at retirement.

### 5. **Adjust and Rebalance**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed based on changing goals or market conditions.

### Conclusion
A balanced and strategic approach helps optimize tax efficiency and supports your long-term financial goals. Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
