Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing this out depending on your age (up to $22,500 in 2023, or $30,000 if you're 50+).
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income level and eligibility.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. Keep in mind that long-term capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income, which can be beneficial.

4. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**: Place higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth. Use taxable accounts for income-generating investments (like bonds) for more favorable tax treatment.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, goals, and overall market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your individual situation.
