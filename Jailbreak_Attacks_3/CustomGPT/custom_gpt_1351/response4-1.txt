To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is free money and a great starting point.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you havenâ€™t maximized your contributions, aim for the limit. If your plan offers low-cost investment options, prioritize this account.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investments you may need in the short to medium term. They offer more flexibility but consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize your tax burden.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Decide your investment strategy (stocks vs. bonds) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Place more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on potential gains.

5. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and any life changes affecting your financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor may also help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
