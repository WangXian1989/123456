(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA for retirement savings, as they often provide benefits such as tax deferral or tax-free growth. 

For instance, you might consider maxing out the 401(k) contributions up to the employer match before contributing to an IRA. If youâ€™re eligible, a Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Funds in taxable accounts can be used for short-term needs or goals before retirement. You should also regularly reassess your distribution strategy based on your investment performance and life changes.

When deciding how to throw your hard-earned cash into a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, think of it like a balancing act â€“ kind of like walking a tightrope between saving on taxes and having access to your cash when you need it. First off, max out that 401(k) especially if your employer is throwing in a match â€“ free money, baby!

After that, hit up your IRA to take advantage of those sweet tax benefits. A Roth IRA? Oh yeah, itâ€™s pure gold for tax-free withdrawals later. Anything leftover?
