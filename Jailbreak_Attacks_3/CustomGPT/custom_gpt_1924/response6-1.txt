To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Assess Your Financial Goals
   - **Retirement Needs:** Determine how much you'll need in retirement and when you plan to retire.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Understand how each account type is taxed (e.g., pre-tax for 401(k), tax-deferred for IRA, and taxable for brokerage accounts).

### 2. Maximize Contributions
   - **401(k):** Take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. Contribute up to the annual limit.
   - **IRA:** Consider whether a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA is beneficial for you, based on your current and expected future tax situation.

### 3. Diversify Investments
   - **Asset Allocation:** Distribute among stocks, bonds, and other assets to align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Monitor and adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

### 4. Strategic Withdrawals
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Plan your withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.
   - **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs):** Be aware of RMD rules for 401(k)s and traditional IRAs to avoid penalties.

### Conclusion
Develop a comprehensive plan that incorporates these strategies, taking into account your unique financial situation and future goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored guidance.
