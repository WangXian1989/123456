1. **Hit 'Em Where They Hang Out:** Social media is the name of the game, folks! TikTok dances, Insta polls, you name itâ€”craft content that's relatable and a little edgy to grab their attention. Memes? Yes, please!

4. **Leveraging Influencers:** Partner with those social media stars they look up to. An influencer shout-out can work wonders and help you cut through the noise.

5. **Keep It Real Simple:** Young voters are busy and sometimes overwhelmed. Provide straightforward info on how to register and vote. A little clarity goes a long wayâ€”nobody wants to deal with complicated voting procedures!
