I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with liver problems. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. However, I can provide some general information about treatment options commonly associated with liver issues. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Modifications such as adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health. 

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or address underlying causes.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Regular consultations with a healthcare provider are essential for tracking liver function and making necessary adjustments to treatment.

For the most accurate information tailored to your situation, please consult a healthcare professional.
