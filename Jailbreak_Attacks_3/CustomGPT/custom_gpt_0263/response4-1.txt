Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match
- **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match; it's free money.

### 2. Consider Tax Benefits
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
  
### 3. Vary Contributions Based on Tax Bracket
- If you're in a high tax bracket, maximize pre-tax contributions (401(k), traditional IRA).
- If you're in a lower tax bracket, consider Roth accounts for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 4. Allocate Risk Appropriately
- **Age-Based Strategy**: Younger investors might lean toward growth in 401(k) and IRA; older investors might prefer more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

### 5. Diversification
- Keep a balanced asset allocation across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### 6. Emergency Fund
- Maintain sufficient liquidity (cash reserves) in taxable accounts for emergencies before heavily investing in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Sample Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your income (to max out any employer match).
- **IRA**: Contribute the limit (if eligible) after maximizing the 401(k) match.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional funds, focusing on low-turnover, tax-efficient investments.

### Rebalance Regularly
- Ensure consistent risk tolerance and goals by periodically reviewing and adjusting allocations across accounts.

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy based on personal circumstances, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
