When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some considerations to help you optimize your investment strategy. 

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to get the full match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, your tax advantages will vary. Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth, whereas Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth on qualified withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Since you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in these accounts, they’re best reserved for investments you might sell in the near term or that generate income, like bonds or stocks with high yields.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your short-term, medium-term, and long-term financial goals. 401(k) and IRA accounts are typically better for long-term growth, while taxable accounts can be more liquid for short or medium-term goals.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified. Don't put all your eggs in one basket; consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level. Market fluctuations can shift your allocation over time.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you’re unsure, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your overall situation.

Ultimately, prioritize maxing out employer matches in your 401(k), then consider contributing to an IRA, and fill any gaps with a taxable account depending on your financial situation and goals.
