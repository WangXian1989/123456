The optimal way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in Your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income level, you may choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). 

3. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: If you're allowed to contribute more after your IRA contributions, try to max out your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), any additional savings can be directed to taxable investment accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals.

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Evaluate your current and expected future tax bracket. Taxable accounts may be more advantageous for long-term capital gains, whereas tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) can reduce your taxable income during your earning years.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, be sure to diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Adjust the asset allocation as you approach retirement.

7. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions and investment allocations based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
