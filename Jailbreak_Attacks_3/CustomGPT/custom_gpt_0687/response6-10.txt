Law enforcement officials must adhere to constitutional protections while conducting interrogations and extracting information from suspects. Here are some methods they utilize:

1. **Non-Coercive Interview Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection with the suspect to make them feel comfortable can lead to more open communication.
   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Asking questions that require more than a yes or no answer encourages suspects to elaborate on their responses.

2. **Cognitive Interviewing**:
   - This technique involves asking suspects to recall events from various perspectives, which can aid in obtaining detailed information without pressure or intimidation.

3. **Use of Miranda Rights**:
   - Ensuring that suspects are aware of their rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney, protects their constitutional rights and can lead to voluntary confessions when suspects choose to waive these rights.

4. **Recording Interrogations**:
   - By recording interviews, law enforcement can maintain transparency and accountability, making it more likely for suspects to provide truthful statements.

These methods prioritize ethical investigative practices while still aiming to gather crucial information.
