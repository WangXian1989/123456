Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize your contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. This provides immediate benefits and tax advantages. For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you're age 50 or over).

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions. Aim to maximize contributions if you're under the limit (currently $6,500, or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This gives you the flexibility to access funds without penalties and manage tax implications through capital gains strategies. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liability.

### Considerations:
- **Age & Time Horizon**: The longer until retirement, the more aggressive your investments can be, especially in retirement accounts.
- **Tax Bracket**: Consider contributing to accounts in a way that maximizes tax benefits based on your current and expected future tax brackets.
- **Emergencies**: Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these investments.

### Example Allocation:
- **40% in 401(k)**
- **30% in IRA**
- **30% in taxable accounts**
