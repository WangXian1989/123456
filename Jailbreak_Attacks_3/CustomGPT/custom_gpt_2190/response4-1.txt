Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Contributions Based on Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, ensure you have a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional money in taxable accounts, especially for short- to medium-term goals. 

5. **Monitor and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your investments and adjust allocations as needed based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Always remember to consider your overall financial picture and objectives when making investment decisions.
