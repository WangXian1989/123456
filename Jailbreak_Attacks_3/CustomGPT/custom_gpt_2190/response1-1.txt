Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic breakdown:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; that’s free money.
   - **Tax Deferral**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, as contributions are made with after-tax dollars and withdrawals are tax-free. A Traditional IRA can be beneficial for current tax deductions.
   - **Diversification of Tax Treatment**: Having both types allows for flexibility in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for long-term investments, such as stocks that qualify for lower capital gains tax rates.
   - **Emergency Funds**: Maintain liquidity for short-term needs without penalties.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize**: Start with maximizing your 401(k) match, then max out your IRA contributions, and finally allocate funds to taxable accounts.
- **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your distributions based on market performance, personal goals, and changing tax laws.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Retirement Timeline**: If you're closer to retirement, prioritize safer investments.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Balance your asset allocation according to your comfort with risk.

### Consultation:
- It might be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
