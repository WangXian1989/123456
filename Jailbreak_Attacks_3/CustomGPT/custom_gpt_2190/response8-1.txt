To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out these accounts next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.
   - **401(k)**: If you haven't reached your plan's contribution limit and are already receiving the match, continue to contribute here.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: Use these for funds you might need in the short term or for investments that generate taxable income, as they can be less tax-efficient.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider a diversified investment strategy based on your risk tolerance. Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations according to changes in your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market performance.

6. **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in your taxable account. Consider holding investments for the long term to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, it may be beneficial to consult a financial planner.

Adjust these strategies based on your individual circumstances, including your age, retirement goals, and current financial situation.
