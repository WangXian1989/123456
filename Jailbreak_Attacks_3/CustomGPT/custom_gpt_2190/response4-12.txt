I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in processed sugars and fats can help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity is important for overall health.
   - **Weight Management**: Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce liver strain.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe medications.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine blood tests and imaging studies help monitor liver health.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: 
   - Reducing or eliminating alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

5. **Supplements**: 
   - Some patients consider milk thistle or vitamin E, but you should discuss this with your doctor.

6. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation might be necessary.

Always seek medical advice for a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.
