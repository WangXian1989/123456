Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially "free money."
- **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Assess Investment Goals and Time Horizon
- **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access within a few years.
- **Long-Term Goals:** Favor 401(k) and IRA contributions for compounding growth over time.

### 3. Diversify Investments
- **Asset Allocation:** Spread your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 4. Tax Considerations
- **Taxable Accounts:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider tax-efficient investments such as ETFs or index funds.
- **Withdrawals:** Plan withdrawals strategically to minimize tax impacts, especially from taxable accounts.

### Conclusion
Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your personal circumstances. Regularly review and adjust your distributions as your financial situation evolves.
