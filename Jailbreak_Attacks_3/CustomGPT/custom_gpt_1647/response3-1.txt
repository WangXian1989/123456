To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high contribution limits and employer matching, consider maxing this out first.
   - **IRA**: After 401(k), contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides immediate tax benefits.

3. **Assess Investment Options**: Look at the investment choices available in each account. If your 401(k) has limited options with high fees, it may be more beneficial to put less into it compared to an IRA with better choices.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends that are subject to lower tax rates. This is also where you can access funds without penalties before retirement age.

5. **Long-Term Growth vs. Short-Term Needs**:
   - Invest in higher growth options (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) where taxes on growth are deferred or avoided.
   - Reserve safer investments for taxable accounts to manage tax impact effectively.

6. **Rebalance Annually**: Assess and adjust your allocations annually to align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice and strategies based on your individual situation.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution to help achieve your retirement goals efficiently.
