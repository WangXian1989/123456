Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowable if you can.
- **IRA/Roth IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions as well. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. Diversify Investments Based on Account Type
- **401(k)**: Typically, this account may have limited investment options. Focus on a diversified mix of stocks and bonds, aligned with your risk tolerance.
- **IRA**: This account often provides a broader range of investment options. Consider more aggressive investments earlier in your career and gradually shift to more conservative options as you approach retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Here you can invest in assets that may have lower capital gains taxes, such as index funds or municipal bonds. Be mindful of the tax implications of trading frequently.

### 3. Adjust Contributions Based on Tax Situation
- If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA. If your income is lower now, traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) can provide a tax break, as you'd be taxed at a lower rate upon withdrawal.

### 4. Maintain Liquidity in Taxable Accounts
- Use taxable accounts for money you may need in the next few years, as they offer more flexibility without penalties for withdrawals.

### 5. Review and Rebalance Regularly
- Ensure your allocations align with your financial goals. Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

### General Recommendations
- **Emergency Savings**: Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund equivalent to 3-6 months of expenses.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 30%-50%
- **IRA**: 20%-30%
- **Taxable Account**: 20%-40%

This allocation can be adjusted based on your financial goals and tax situation. 

### Final Thoughts
Consider your retirement timeline and account limits when making decisions on distribution. Each scenario may differ, so it's essential to plan according to your unique circumstances.
