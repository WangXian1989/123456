Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer potential tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on whether you expect your tax rate to be higher or lower in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings are generally taxed, but capital gains rates may be lower than ordinary income rates. Use this account for more liquid investments or for goals within 5-10 years.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Consider keeping money in taxable accounts for liquidity and easier access.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Max out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from compound growth and tax deferral.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to minimize risk.
   - Each account can have different asset allocations based on your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how and when you will access funds. Taxable accounts can provide cash flow for short-term needs without penalties, while retirement accounts have restrictions until age 59Â½.

### 5. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs, adjusting your strategy based on those. For 2023, max contributions are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+) for IRAs.

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Start with enough to get any employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Choose traditional or Roth based on your tax situation.
3. **Invest in a Taxable Account**: Use this for any additional savings or investments after maxing out retirement accounts.

### Regular Review
Reassess your distribution strategy annually or when your financial situation changes to stay aligned with your retirement goals.

It can also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances.
