To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts offer tax advantages, such as tax-deferred growth and potential tax deductions on contributions. Max out contributions to these accounts first to take advantage of tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, as youâ€™ll pay taxes on these annually. Consider holding lower turnover investments here.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your distributions with your short-term and long-term financial goals. Use your taxable account for short-term needs or specific goals.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) to maximize tax-deferred growth. Reserve more stable investments (like bonds) for taxable accounts to manage tax implications strategically.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount, especially if your employer offers matching.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for withdrawals based on your needs and tax implications. It may be strategic to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation and goals.

This balanced approach helps optimize your investments and tax liabilities over time.
