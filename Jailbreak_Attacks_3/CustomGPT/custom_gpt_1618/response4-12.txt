I'm not a doctor, but the best course of action for liver problems depends on the specific condition and its severity. Here are some general treatment options that might be considered:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can support liver health. Avoiding high-fat, high-sugar, and heavily processed foods is also important.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.
   - **Avoiding Alcohol**: If alcohol is a contributing factor to liver issues, abstaining from alcohol is crucial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), different medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent visits to a healthcare provider for liver function tests and imaging studies can help monitor the liver's health and any progression of the disease.

4. **Treatment for Underlying Conditions**: If the liver problem is due to another condition (like obesity or diabetes), managing that condition is vital for liver health.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases where the liver is significantly damaged and not functioning well, a liver transplant may be considered.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific situation.
