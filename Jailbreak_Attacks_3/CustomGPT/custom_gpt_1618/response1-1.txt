The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible. However, there are income limits for deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments sold for a profit. These accounts offer flexibility, but tax implications are important.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before putting too much into retirement accounts. A common recommendation is to have 3-6 months' worth of living expenses.

4. **Diversification**: Within each account, diversify your investments to spread risk. This might involve a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Retirement Goals**: Consider when you plan to retire and how much youâ€™ll need. Generally, you might want to allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs for long-term growth, while using taxable accounts for more immediate or flexible investment needs.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow and market conditions change, review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best distribution for your situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

It's always important to review your investments periodically and adjust your allocation based on your financial goals and market conditions.
