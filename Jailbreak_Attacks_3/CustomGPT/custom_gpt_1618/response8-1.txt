When it comes to distributing your money among different investment accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to help guide your distribution:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money. Additionally, consider contributing to the maximum limit allowed by the IRS ($20,500 for 2022 and $22,500 for 2023, with catch-up contributions for those aged 50 and older).
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, aim to max out contributions to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, with a limit of $6,000 in 2022 and $6,500 in 2023, plus catch-up contributions if you're over 50). Choose the type of IRA based on your current and expected tax situation.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Roth IRA**: If you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, as it allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA may be more advantageous, as you can deduct contributions from your taxable income now.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) within each account to spread risk.
   - Consider using your tax-advantaged accounts for higher growth investments (like stocks) and holding more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

4. **Understand Withdrawal Rules**:
   - Be aware of the withdrawal rules for each account type. 401(k) and Traditional IRA funds are subject to income tax upon withdrawal, while Roth IRA contributions can be withdrawn tax-free. In contrast, taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains tax.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review your investment distribution and asset allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change. Rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**:
   - Consider your financial goals. If you have short-term goals (such as buying a house in the next few years), you might want to keep some funds in a taxable account for liquidity. For long-term goals (like retirement), prioritize maximizing contributions in tax-advantaged accounts.

If you're unsure about the best approach for your situation, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your unique circumstances.
