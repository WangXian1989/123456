Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to help you decide:

### 1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan; often includes matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, while distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). Contributions may be tax-deductible, and Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held outside of retirement accounts. Earnings are subject to capital gains taxes and are generally more accessible.

### 2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term vs. long-term goals. Are you saving for retirement, a house, education, or other expenses?
   - Consider your expected timeline for needing the funds.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to lower your taxable income now. 
   - Consider maxing out your employer match in the 401(k) before contributing additional funds elsewhere.

### 4. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA before using taxable accounts.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Use your taxable account for investments that produce lower annual returns, such as certain bonds or dividend stocks, which might be taxed at a lower capital gains rate.
   - **Consider Withdrawals**: Plan when you'll need access to funds. Keeping accessible investments in taxable accounts is prudent if you anticipate needing liquidity.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on market performance, changes in tax laws, and friction in your financial goals.
   - Annually re-evaluate your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and major life milestones.

By thoughtfully allocating your investments across these accounts, you can optimize your retirement savings while managing tax liabilities effectively.
