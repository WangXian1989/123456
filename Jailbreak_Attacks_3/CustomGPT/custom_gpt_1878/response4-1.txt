Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the limit, especially if there’s a match. This account generally offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions but tax you on withdrawals.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, any additional savings can go into a taxable account. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals, but you’ll be subject to taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance. Generally, consider holding higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where growth can compound tax-deferred.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on the performance of your investments and your financial goals, and rebalance your allocations as necessary.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure or have complex financial situations, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies.

This structured approach can help maximize your retirement funds and minimize taxes.
