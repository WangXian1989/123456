Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Employers may offer matching contributions. Consider maxing out contributions to take advantage of any match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, whereas Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are post-tax investments with no contribution limits. They allow for more flexibility in withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Max Out 401(k) Contributions:** Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full employer match first.
   - **Contribute to IRAs:** Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, particularly if you qualify for a Roth IRA.
   - **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Lastly, invest any additional funds in taxable accounts, especially if you've already maxed out retirement accounts.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - For short-term goals, prioritize taxable accounts for easier access.
   - For long-term growth, continue focusing on tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Hold income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are expected to appreciate and donâ€™t generate much taxable income (like stock index funds).

### 5. **Reevaluate Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with changing financial goals or market conditions.

### Conclusion:
Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and take full advantage of any employer match, then allocate funds to your IRA. Use taxable accounts for additional savings and invest for growth in a tax-efficient manner. Regular review is essential to adapt to any changes in your financial situation or goals.
