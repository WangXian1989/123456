Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - **Short-term needs**: Allocate more funds to taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (up to $6,500 for 2024 or $7,500 if you're over 50) for additional tax benefits.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions may reduce your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments may realize capital gains or losses. Be mindful of the tax implications on dividends and interest earned.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account type to mitigate risk.

### 5. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon**
   - Longer time horizons favor growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter horizons, consider more conservative investments in taxable accounts to ensure liquidity.

### 6. **Adjust As Needed**
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio as your financial situation or goals change.

### Conclusion
Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax advantages. Use taxable accounts for short-term needs or investments that generate taxable income. Regularly reassess your financial situation to ensure your distribution strategy aligns with your goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights tailored to your circumstances.
