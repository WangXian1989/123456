To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax Advantages:**
   - **Maximize Contributions to 401(k):**
     - Take full advantage of any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
     - Contribute up to the annual limit if financially feasible.
   - **Contribute to IRA:**
     - If eligible, focus on a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
     - Traditional IRA contributions can reduce your taxable income now.

### 2. **Balance with Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Maintain Liquidity:**
     - Allocate funds for short-term goals or emergencies in taxable accounts for easy access without penalties.
   - **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
     - Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
     - Use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains with losses.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - **Asset Allocation:**
     - Diversify across different asset classes in each account to spread risk.
     - Adjust the allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 4. **Review and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly assess your investment performance and adjust contributions accordingly.
   - Rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Conclusion:
- Start by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts before funding taxable accounts.
- Ensure liquidity through your taxable account while focusing on tax efficiency for long-term growth.
