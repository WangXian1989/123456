Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy you can consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it's essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if financially feasible.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment gains are subject to capital gains tax. Consider these for investments you plan to hold for the long term to minimize tax impact.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on a balanced mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** It may benefit you to hold tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs), as these generate fewer taxable events.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have adequate liquidity to cover emergencies before investing heavily in these accounts.

### 5. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - Align your distribution strategy with your short-term and long-term goals, adjusting your asset allocation as you approach those goals.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Life circumstances, tax laws, and financial markets change. Regularly review your distribution strategy to ensure alignment with your goals.

### Example Distribution Plan:
- **401(k):** Max out contributions up to the employer match.
- **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** Contribute the maximum allowable amount.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any remaining funds, focusing on tax-efficient investments.
