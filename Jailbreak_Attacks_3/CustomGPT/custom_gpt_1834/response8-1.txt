When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and should be a priority.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - A **Traditional IRA** offers tax-deferred growth, similar to a 401(k). 
     - A **Roth IRA** allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t offer tax advantages like retirement accounts, but they provide more flexibility and can be beneficial for shorter-term goals.

3. **Fund IRAs After 401(k) Match**: After maximizing the match, consider funding an IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it might be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

4. **Contribute to 401(k)**: If you can, continue contributing to your 401(k) after funding your IRA, especially if you're close to the contribution limit.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any savings goals that are more short-term or for investments that might generate taxable income, like real estate or stocks with high dividends.

6. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and timeline. You might want to hold more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage taxes better.

7. **Rebalance and Review**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation, especially regarding tax implications.

Always consider your individual circumstances, including your age, retirement timeline, and whether you anticipate being in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement.
