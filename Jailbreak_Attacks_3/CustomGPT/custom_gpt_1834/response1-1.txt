Distributing money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
   - **Tax-deferred Growth**: Since contributions are made pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth 401(k)), this can be a great place for aggressive growth investments.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your tax situation now versus in retirement.
   - **Flexibility**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax diversification.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: Keep some investments here for easier access to cash without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on capital gains and qualified dividends, as these are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Start with Contributions**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to utilize tax advantages. 
- **Diversity**: Maintain a balance of stocks, bonds, and cash across all accounts, adjusting based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Consider Future Income Needs**: Think about when you’ll need access to funds and plan the distribution accordingly to minimize taxes and optimize growth.

Before you decide, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan that suits your unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
