The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first as this is essentially free money. Consider contributing up to the maximum limit for tax benefits.
   - **IRA:** After your 401(k) contributions, consider funding a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, whereas traditional IRAs may give you tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) for tax-free withdrawals.
   - If you anticipate being in a lower bracket, a traditional 401(k) or IRA may be beneficial as it defers taxes until withdrawal.

3. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs:**
   - Maintain a cash reserve in your taxable account for emergencies or short-term goals (3-6 months' worth of expenses). This helps avoid early withdrawal penalties on retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to balance risk and reward.

5. **Periodic Review and Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review your allocation based on your changing financial situation and market performance. Rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Contribution Limits and Ages:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and age-related catch-up contributions if applicable (e.g., individuals aged 50+).

7. **Investment Timeline:**
   - For longer-term goals, focus on growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term needs, consider more stable investments in taxable accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor may also provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
