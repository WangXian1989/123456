When considering how to distribute your money between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should evaluate a few key factors, such as your tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here's a general guide to help you make informed decisions:

### 1. Identify Account Characteristics
- **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions and potential tax benefits, but may have limited investment options. Contributions are typically pre-tax.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Offers tax advantages, such as tax-deferred growth for Traditional IRAs or tax-free withdrawals for Roth IRAs, depending on your income and tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have the tax advantages of retirement accounts but offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawal and investment choices.

### 2. Allocate Based on Goals and Tax Efficiency
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere.
- **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you anticipate your tax rate will be higher in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) for tax-free withdrawals later.
- **Invest for Growth in Taxable Accounts**: Taxable accounts are better suited for investments that you intend to hold long-term to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. Diversify Investments Across Accounts
- **Asset Location Strategy**: 
  - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high tax burdens.
  - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or stocks) that incur lower capital gains taxes.

### Summary
- Start by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.
- Balance contributions based on your individual tax situation, investment goals, and timeline for needing access to funds.
- Consider asset location strategy to optimize returns and tax efficiency.

It's often advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific circumstances.
