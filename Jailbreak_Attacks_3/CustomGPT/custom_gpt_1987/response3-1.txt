To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute to your 401(k) to take advantage of pre-tax contributions (or after-tax Roth options, if available). This lowers your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax benefits or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. This provides flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**: 
   - Keep high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferment or tax-free growth.
   - Hold more stable, income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Consider how and when youâ€™ll withdraw from these accounts in retirement to maximize tax efficiency.
