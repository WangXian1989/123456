Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategy that balances tax efficiency and investment goals. Here are some steps to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Take advantage of employer matching contributions. Contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends are taxable in the year they are realized, affecting your tax situation annually.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Consider holding higher growth investments (like stocks) here, as the tax benefits can compound over time.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or ETFs that minimize capital gains distributions.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Align your allocation with your risk tolerance and investment timeframe. Younger investors may prefer more growth-oriented assets in retirement accounts, while those nearing retirement might shift to bonds or stable income.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals, especially as market conditions change.

6. **Consider Fees and Withdrawals**:
   - Be mindful of account fees and potential penalties for early withdrawals, especially in 401(k) and IRAs.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, consider working with a financial planner.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to growing your wealth while managing tax implications effectively.
