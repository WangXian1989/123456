Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: 
   - Before heavily investing, pay off any high-interest debts. The interest saved is often greater than investment returns.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Allocate funds according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. For long-term growth, stocks may be suitable, while bonds can provide stability for shorter-term needs.

4. **Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with lower tax liabilities, such as index funds or tax-efficient funds, to minimize capital gains tax. 

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider where to withdraw funds first in retirement. Generally, itâ€™s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized guidance can help you develop a strategy tailored to your unique situation.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced distribution that aligns with your financial goals and maximizes your investment efficiency.
