Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time frame. Here's a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. A Roth is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Investment Goals**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need sooner. This allows for more accessible withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Prioritize retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for their tax benefits.

### 3. **Balance Your Risk Tolerance**
   - **Aggressive Growth**: Invest more heavily in equities within your tax-advantaged accounts where tax growth is beneficial.
   - **Conservative Investments**: Consider holding bonds or cash-equivalents in taxable accounts to manage liquidity and access.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments with lower tax implications (like index funds) for tax efficiency.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Hold higher growth investments in these accounts to defer taxes on capital gains.

### 5. **Regular Reassessment**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, market conditions, and personal circumstances.

### Final Thought
This diversified approach provides balanced growth while maximizing tax advantages tailored to your personal financial landscape.
