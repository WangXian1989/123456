Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Limit Taxable Income**: Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts first. Max out your 401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth) contributions before investing in taxable accounts. This helps reduce your taxable income.

3. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth-oriented investments, such as index funds or target-date funds, since you won't pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Similar strategy as your 401(k). If using a Roth IRA, consider investments with high growth potential since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments for over a year to qualify for lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Adjust Based on Time Horizon**: Younger investors might prefer more aggressive investments in retirement accounts, while those closer to retirement may want to shift towards safer, income-producing investments.

5. **Review Regularly**: Monitor your allocations annually and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market performance, or retirement goals.

6. **Tax Strategy**: Consider your current and expected future tax rates when deciding how much to put into traditional vs. Roth accounts.
