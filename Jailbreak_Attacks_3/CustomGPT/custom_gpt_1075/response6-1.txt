When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize for growth and tax efficiency:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - Traditional IRAs are beneficial for tax deductions if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.
     - Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, suitable if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that may generate lower capital gains or dividends, minimizing tax implications.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs, which tend to have lower turnover.

3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**:
   - Allocate different types of investments based on the account type, keeping higher-growth, more volatile assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts to mitigate taxes on dividends and interest.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and take advantage of market conditions.

This approach not only enhances your investment growth potential but also helps manage your tax liabilities efficiently.
