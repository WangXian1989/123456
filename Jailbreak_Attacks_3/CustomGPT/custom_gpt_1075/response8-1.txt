To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match since thatâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Next, consider maxing out your IRA, as it typically offers tax advantages.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions may reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts do not provide upfront tax benefits but allow for more flexible access to your money.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments, such as stocks, in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - Consider holding lower-growth investments, like bonds, in taxable accounts, as they may be taxed at lower rates.

4. **Regular Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly assess and adjust your investment allocation based on your risk tolerance and market changes.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement to minimize taxes. For instance, you may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: 
   - Think about your long-term financial goals and any potential need for liquidity. Taxable accounts can provide quicker access to funds, which might be necessary for certain plans or emergencies.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By following these strategies, you can effectively manage and distribute your investments for better long-term growth and tax efficiency.
