(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, a good strategy is to contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, since IRAs often have lower fees and more investment options. Finally, use taxable accounts for any additional saving and investing needs after youâ€™ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts. Diversifying your investments across all three types of accounts can help manage risk and taxes effectively. Itâ€™s also wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific circumstances.

Itâ€™s usually got lower fees and can give you a wild variety of investment options. Lastly, whateverâ€™s left should go into taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re perfect for that cash you want to play with on the side. Just remember, tax rules can be a real pain, so chatting with a financial wizard (also known as an advisor) would totally help you figure out the best strategy for your situation!
