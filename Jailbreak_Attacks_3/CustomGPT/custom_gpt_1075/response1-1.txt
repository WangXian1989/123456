Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into your IRA or taxable accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now, but you will pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. Roth 401(k) contributions are after-tax, which means tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similarly, traditional IRAs allow for pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs use after-tax contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Youâ€™ll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains in these accounts, but they offer more flexibility and no restrictions on withdrawals.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk. This may include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Long-Term Focus**: Ideally, your 401(k) and IRA should be seen as long-term retirement savings vehicles, while taxable accounts can be used for more immediate financial goals.

5. **Adjust for Retirement**: As you approach retirement, you might want to shift more of your investments into safer assets to preserve your capital.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can tailor a distribution plan to your specific situation and help with tax efficiency.

Regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy as your financial situation and family needs change.
