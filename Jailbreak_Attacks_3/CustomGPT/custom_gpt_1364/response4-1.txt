To optimize the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if feasible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your tax situation) to benefit from tax-free growth or tax deductions.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs in your taxable account to minimize capital gains taxes. 
   - Use your IRA and 401(k) accounts to hold investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds), as these won't be taxed until withdrawal.

3. **Diversification**: 
   - Aim for a balanced mix of asset classes across all accounts. Ensure you're not over-concentrated in any one area. 

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance, adjusting contributions as necessary.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically during retirement to minimize taxes, starting with taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: 
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

Implementing these strategies can help you effectively distribute your money across your accounts for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
