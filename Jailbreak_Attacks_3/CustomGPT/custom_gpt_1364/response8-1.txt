To optimally distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - For higher-income years, focus on tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) to lower your current taxable income.
   - In lower-income years, consider converting some of your 401(k) or Traditional IRA funds to a Roth IRA, paying taxes at a lower rate.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocating assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline across all accounts is crucial:
   - Stocks for growth in accounts with long time horizons (e.g., 401(k) and Roth IRA).
   - Bonds and fixed-income investments in taxable accounts for income generation, as they can be taxed more favorably than regular income.

5. **Keep an Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate savings fund for unexpected expenses, which can influence your approach to investing in these accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically to maintain alignment with your financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances. Would you like more detailed information on any of these points?
