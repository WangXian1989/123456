When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan offering tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Provides tax advantages for retirement savings, with both traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free) options.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Regular investment accounts where you pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in the year they are realized.

2. **Maximize Employer Match:** 
   If your employer offers matching contributions in your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to maximize that match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You'll owe taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains, which can impact your strategy.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   Consider the types of investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) and diversify your portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. You can use your 401(k) for more aggressive investments (if you're young) while keeping conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

5. **Emergency Fund:** 
   Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses, typically in a high-yield savings account.

6. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   Review and adjust your allocations annually or after significant market movements to ensure your investment strategy remains aligned with your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   For personalized advice, especially if your financial situation is complex, consider consulting with a financial advisor to build a strategy tailored to your individual goals and circumstances.

In practice, one common approach might be to fund your 401(k) to the employer match, contribute to an IRA, and then put any excess funds into a taxable account, focusing on long-term growth and tax efficiency. Reevaluate this strategy annually as your income, tax status, and investment opportunities change.
