When it comes to distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (in the case of Roth IRA). Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, which is essentially free money.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Consider your current tax bracket and expected tax situation in the future. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, it might be wise to prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA. On the other hand, if you expect your income to decrease in retirement, traditional tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) may be more beneficial.

3. **Consider Investment Options**: Different accounts often have different investment options. Your 401(k) may have limited choices, while IRAs and taxable accounts generally offer more flexibility. Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your long-term investment goals.

4. **Balance Between Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider investing additional funds in taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices but remember that investment gains in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, make sure to reassess and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation. This ensures that no one account becomes too heavily weighted in one area, which can help manage risk.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about the best distribution plan based on your unique financial situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor. They can offer personalized guidance tailored to your goals and financial circumstances.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced and efficient distribution strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
