To optimize your investment strategy, consider the following approach for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if thereâ€™s a matching contribution. This provides tax-deferred growth and potential employer benefits.

2. **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and retirement plans. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate short-term capital gains or for funds that you may need before retirement. Focus on low-turnover investments to minimize tax impacts.

Evaluate your overall asset allocation and tax implications as you distribute funds. Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor your strategy to your financial goals and risk tolerance.
