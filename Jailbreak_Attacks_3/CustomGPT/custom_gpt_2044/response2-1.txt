When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you structure your investments effectively:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match, as it is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowable limit if your budget allows.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, potentially reducing your current taxable income.

2. **Diversification Across Accounts:**
   - Distribute your investments among the three types of accounts to diversify your tax treatment. For example, consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in the tax-advantaged accounts, while holding more stable, income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - Assess your current and expected future tax rates. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing contributions to a Roth IRA may be beneficial. Conversely, if you expect a lower tax rate, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) might be more advantageous.

4. **Liquidity Needs:**
   - Ensure that you have enough liquid assets in taxable accounts for short-term financial needs. Taxable accounts allow for easier access to funds without penalties that may apply to early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

5. **Regular Reassessment:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your investment allocations to reflect changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals. 

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation and goals.

By balancing contributions among these accounts, you can optimize your investment strategy for growth, tax efficiency, and liquidity.
