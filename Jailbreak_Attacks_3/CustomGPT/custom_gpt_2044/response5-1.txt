(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it is essential to evaluate several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Generally, a balanced approach is recommended:

1. **401(k):** Start by maximizing contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), particularly if your employer offers matching contributions. This provides a significant immediate return on your investment.

2. **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k), consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. Each type has different tax benefits: traditional IRAs may offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable accounts:** Finally, allocate funds to taxable investment accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and liquidity; however, be mindful of capital gains taxes on investment returns.

Adjust your contributions based on changes in income, financial needs, and market conditions, and consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.

1. **Max out that 401(k):** Seriously, if your boss is throwing in free money through matching, grab it! Put in as much as you can. Itâ€™s like winning a mini lottery every paycheck, but with tax perks. 

2. **Hit the IRA next:** Once your 401(k) is rolling, dive into either a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may save on taxes now, while Roth IRAs are like tax-free magic at retirement. Choose based on whether you want to pay taxes now or later; itâ€™s like choosing your poison.

3. **Taxable accounts are your wild card:** These bad boys give you the freedom to sell and withdraw whenever you please. Sure, you'll deal with capital gains, but they can be handy for flexibility or when you want to splurge on something nice without dipping into retirement funds.

Just keep tabs on your expenses and adjust the contributions based on your earnings and goals, and donâ€™t hesitate to holler at a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your unique situation. You've got this! ðŸ’°
