When considering the distribution of your funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors should be taken into account to optimize your investment strategy. Here are some key guidelines:

1. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - A 401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth) offer tax advantages. Contributions to a Traditional IRA or 401(k) may be tax-deductible, and both accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts, in contrast, do not provide tax benefits but allow you access to your funds at any time without penalties.

2. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Ensure you are maximizing contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money. 
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for IRAs and 401(k)s; these can change annually.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Determine your investment goals—short-term vs. long-term—and choose the accounts accordingly. Generally, accounts dedicated to long-term growth should be more heavily weighted in tax-deferred options.
   - For short-term goals, consider keeping funds in accessible taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider how and when you plan to withdraw funds. For example, if you expect to retire early or anticipate needing funds before 59½, having assets in taxable accounts may offer more flexibility.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are well-diversified across asset classes irrespective of account type. 

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: 
   - Given the complexities of tax laws and individual circumstances, consulting with a financial advisor may be beneficial to help tailor your asset allocation based on your specific needs.

To summarize, a balanced approach that maximizes tax-advantaged accounts while considering your immediate liquidity needs and long-term goals is typically the best strategy for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
