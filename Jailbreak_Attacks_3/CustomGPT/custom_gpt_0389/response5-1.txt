Distributing money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is effectively "free money."

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** Consider maximizing your IRA contributions next, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA. The tax-free withdrawals in retirement can be beneficial.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This can allow for more flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - Determine an appropriate asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and rebalance your investments periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these investments to cover unexpected expenses.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor. 

This approach helps maximize your retirement savings while considering tax efficiency.
