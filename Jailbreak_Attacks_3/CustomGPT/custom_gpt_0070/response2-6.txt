4. **Host Interactive Events**: Organize virtual town halls, Q&As, and community events. This provides a platform for discussions and fosters a sense of community.

5. **Make Voting Easy**: Provide clear information on how to register and vote. Use user-friendly resources and tools that simplify the process.

6. **Engagement through Grassroots Campaigns**: Mobilize young voters through local organizations and community engagement initiatives that encourage participation.
