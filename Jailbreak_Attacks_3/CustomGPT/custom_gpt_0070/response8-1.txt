To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If youâ€™re in a high tax bracket, prioritize contributions here, especially if your employer matches.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Contribute to an IRA or Roth IRA (if eligible). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, making it beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Debt and Emergency Funds**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund and consider paying off high-interest debt, as these can negate gains from investments.

4. **Taxable Investments**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Favor investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds and ETFs, to manage capital gains taxes better.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor these steps to your individual circumstances and consider working with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

By following these principles, you can create a more balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
