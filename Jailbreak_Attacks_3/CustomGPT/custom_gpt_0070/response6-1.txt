When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
- **401(k):** Maximize contributions for tax-deferred growth. Look out for any employer match.
- **IRA:** Choose a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. 

### 2. Investment Goals
- **401(k):** Focus on long-term growth and maximize employer contributions.
- **IRA:** Use for retirement, balancing between stocks and bonds as you approach retirement age.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for short-term or intermediate needs since this account can be accessed without penalties.

### Considerations
- Diversify investments across all accounts to reduce risk.
- Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

### Action Plan
1. **Assess Current Distribution:** Evaluate how much you have in each account.
2. **Prioritize Contributions:** Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts first, then fund taxable accounts based on your liquidity needs.
3. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Tailor the strategy to your specific financial goals and risk tolerance.

By understanding the benefits and limitations of each account type, you can create a balanced and efficient investment strategy.
