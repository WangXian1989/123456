Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions up to that match. It's essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Max out contributions if possible. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Generally better suited for investments that are less tax-efficient (e.g., stocks with high growth potential). Hold long-term investments here to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Invest across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts, but adjust based on account type:
     - **Taxable:** Favor long-term investments.
     - **Tax-Advantaged:** Can include a mix of higher-risk, potentially higher-return investments, since gains are tax-deferred or tax-free.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Consider how and when you plan to withdraw funds. Tax-advantaged accounts usually have penalties for early withdrawals, while taxable accounts can typically be accessed without penalties.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly reassess your allocations based on performance, changes in risk tolerance, or changes in financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 20% of total savings
- **IRA:** 15% of total savings
- **Taxable Account:** 10% of total savings

This allocation can be adjusted based on personal circumstances and goals.

### Final Note
Consider consulting a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that reflects your situation and objectives.
