Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, investment timeline, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy you can consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first, as it’s essentially free money. The contribution limits for a 401(k) are higher than for IRAs.

2. **IRA Accounts**: After taking advantage of the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your income, one may be more beneficial than the other.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings after maxing out your retirement accounts can be directed to taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investments, but you’ll pay taxes on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Generally, it’s wise to hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalancing and Monitoring**: Regularly review your asset allocation and performance to adjust your strategy as needed, especially as you approach retirement.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
