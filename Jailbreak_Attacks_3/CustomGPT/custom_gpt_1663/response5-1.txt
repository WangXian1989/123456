(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, a common strategy is:

1. **Maximize contributions to your 401(k)**, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This is effectively "free money."
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income level and tax strategy. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous.
3. **Allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts** for flexibility, as you'll have fewer restrictions on withdrawals compared to retirement accounts.

It's essential to consider the tax implications of each account type and how they align with your long-term financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor could also provide personalized guidance.
