The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, investment strategy, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is free money that can significantly boost your savings.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debts, it's often wise to pay those off before contributing too much to retirement accounts, as the interest on debt can outpace investment returns.

3. **Contribute to an IRA**: Once you have met the employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Maximize Your 401(k)**: After contributing to your IRA, focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k). This is especially relevant if you expect your income to increase in the future, as investing now can lead to significant growth.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you're looking for more liquidity or have short-term goals, consider opening a taxable investment account. This allows for more flexible withdrawals without penalties and can be helpful if you need funds for goals like buying a home or starting a business.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments within each account align with your overall asset allocation strategy. This might mean holding different types of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) in your 401(k) versus your taxable accounts.

7. **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Use tax-efficient investments in your taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

8. **Regular Reviews and Adjustments**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions and investment strategies based on life changes, market conditions, and tax implications.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor an approach that fits your specific circumstances and goals.
