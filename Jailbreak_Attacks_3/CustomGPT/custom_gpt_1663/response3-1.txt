To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older). Roth IRAs are excellent if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match and contributing to your IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if age 50 or older).

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This offers flexibility and may provide capital gains advantages.

5. **Asset Location**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs or 401(k)s) and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds and stocks) in taxable accounts.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are well-diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to manage risk.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Determining the best distribution of your funds will depend on your personal financial situation, including your age, income, tax bracket, and retirement goals. Adjust your strategy as your circumstances change.
