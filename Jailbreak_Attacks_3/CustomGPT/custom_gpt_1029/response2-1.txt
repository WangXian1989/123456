When distributing funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These are tax-advantaged accounts. Traditional accounts offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth accounts offer tax-free growth. Maximize contributions to these before investing heavily in taxable accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor investments with lower tax implications (like index funds or ETFs) to limit capital gains taxes.

2. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Stay aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs (both traditional and Roth). Aim to max out these contributions if possible.

3. **Investment Time Horizon**:
   - Long-term goals can benefit from higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while safer assets may be more appropriate for taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawals**:
   - Consider future tax implications of withdrawing from each account. Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxable, while Roth withdrawals (after a certain age) are not.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio is well-diversified, regardless of account type. Include a mix of equities, bonds, and other asset classes.

6. **Financial Goals**:
   - Align your investment strategy with your short-term and long-term financial goals. Adjust your allocations based on risk tolerance and time horizon.

7. **Professional Advice**:
   - Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your individual circumstances.

A general strategy might look like this:
- Max out your 401(k) if your employer matches contributions.
- Contribute to an IRA or Roth IRA after maximizing the 401(k).
- Use taxable accounts for any additional savings or investments.

Adjustments may be necessary based on your specific financial picture, including tax bracket, financial goals, and investment preferences.
