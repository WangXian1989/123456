Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax considerations, retirement goals, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to capture this match, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After fully funding your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k). It's typically easier due to payroll deductions and may have higher contribution limits than an IRA.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, direct any additional funds to taxable accounts. This provides flexibility and liquidity, as you can access these funds without penalties.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or high-turnover funds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or stocks) in taxable accounts.

6. **Regularly Review Asset Allocation**:
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation across accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Utilize Dollar-Cost Averaging**:
   - When distributing new funds, consider dollar-cost averaging to reduce the impact of market volatility.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
