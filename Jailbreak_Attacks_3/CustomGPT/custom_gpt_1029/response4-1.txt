Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount if you're able.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation and retirement plans.

2. **Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate short-term capital gains or for income-producing investments that would be taxed at a higher rate.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts, but you may want to hold your riskier investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement, considering tax implications and required minimum distributions (RMDs).

Itâ€™s wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor an approach that fits your specific financial situation and goals.
