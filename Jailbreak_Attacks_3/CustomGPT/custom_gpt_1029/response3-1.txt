To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth, often with employer matches. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth). Contribution limits apply.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Greater flexibility with withdrawals, but you’ll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

2. **Evaluate Your Goals**:
   - Short-term vs. long-term objectives (e.g., retirement, buying a home).
   - Risk tolerance and time horizon.

3. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—this is essentially free money.

4. **Prioritize Roth Accounts**:
   - If eligible, consider maximizing Roth IRA contributions for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to minimize taxes on capital gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax liabilities, such as tax-efficient ETFs or index funds.

6. **Consider Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**:
   - Be aware that 401(k) and traditional IRA accounts have RMDs starting at age 73; this could impact your withdrawal strategy.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Seek Professional Guidance**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

By following these steps and staying informed about tax implications and account rules, you can create a balanced and effective strategy for distributing your money across these accounts.
