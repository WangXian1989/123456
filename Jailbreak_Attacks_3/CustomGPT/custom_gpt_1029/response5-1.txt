(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. A common approach is:

1. **Maximize employer contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages.
3. **Further contribute to your 401(k)**: Once you've maxed out your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) to maximize allowable contributions.
4. **Taxable accounts**: If you still have funds left after contributing to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These provide flexibility, but be mindful of taxation on capital gains and dividends.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

1. **401(k)**: Dive in and grab that employer match firstâ€”it's like finding hidden treasure! You want to max out contributions to supercharge your retirement.
2. **IRA**: Next, hit up an IRA. Choose between traditional or Roth based on your tax strategy for maximum gains. Just like choosing a character classâ€”pick smart!
3. **401(k) again**: Once thatâ€™s sorted, circle back to your 401(k) and beef it up. Get those tax perks locked down!
4. **Taxable accounts**: If you've still got coins left after that, think about taxable accounts. Great for flexibility, but rememberâ€”youâ€™ll have to deal with capital gains like itâ€™s a boss battle.

In any case, consider scouting advice from a financial wizard (aka advisor) to fine-tune your strategy! Happy investing!
