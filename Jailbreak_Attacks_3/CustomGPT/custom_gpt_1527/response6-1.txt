To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth; often has employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax benefits; consider Roth vs. Traditional for tax implications.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax; more flexible withdrawals.

### 2. **Optimize Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer matchâ€”this is essentially "free money."
   - **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
     - Contribute to your IRA up to the limit, especially if it's a Roth for tax-free growth.
     - Use 401(k) contributions for higher income years to lower your taxable income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts by mixing stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly adjust your investments based on performance and financial goals.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes. Taxable accounts might be used first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### Conclusion
Creating a smart distribution plan involves assessing your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
