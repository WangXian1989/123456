The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If your employer offers a Roth 401(k), consider using it for potential tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a tax deduction, consider contributing to a traditional IRA. If not, a Roth IRA may be better for tax-free withdrawals later.
  
3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Debt Management**: Pay down high-interest debts before prioritizing additional retirement savings.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors may focus on growth-oriented investments, while those closer to retirement may prioritize capital preservation.
   - Diversify investments across accounts to balance risk and return.

6. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out. Invest in tax-efficient funds or indexes, which can minimize your tax burden.

7. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations periodically or as your financial situation changes. Adjust contributions as needed based on performance and life changes.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can also be beneficial.
