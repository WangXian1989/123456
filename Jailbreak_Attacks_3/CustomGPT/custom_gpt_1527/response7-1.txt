To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, focusing on your tax situation (pre-tax vs. post-tax benefits).

### 2. **Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to sooner.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Asset Location**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Management:**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds) and sectors to manage risk.

### 5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Maintain a liquid emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

### 6. **Regular Contribution and Rebalancing:**
   - Set up automatic contributions to each account and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Summary
Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, assess your goals, optimize for taxes, and maintain diversification. Regularly review your strategy to adapt to any changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.
