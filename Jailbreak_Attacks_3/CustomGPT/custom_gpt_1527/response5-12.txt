I'm not a doctor, but I can share some general treatment options for liver issues. Treatment depends on the specific condition, but common options include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the diagnosis (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and monitoring liver function tests are crucial for managing conditions.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.
