When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income. Consider maximizing employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains, so they could be better for investments that yield long-term growth.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRAs. For 2024, the limit for a 401(k) is $23,000, and for IRAs is $6,500 (with catch-up contributions available if you’re over 50).

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Age-based asset allocation can guide you on how aggressively to invest.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investment types across accounts. This can help minimize overall risk.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max Out Employer Match on 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get the full employer match; this is essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to IRA Accounts**: If eligible, max out your IRA contributions next, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out these tax-advantaged accounts, direct additional savings into taxable accounts. Be mindful of the types of investments chosen to manage tax efficiency.

### Example Allocation (based on a hypothetical total savings of $30,000):
- **401(k)**: $10,000 (max out match)
- **Traditional/Roth IRA**: $6,500 (max out)
- **Taxable Accounts**: $13,500 (for remaining savings)

### Monitor and Adjust:
- Review your allocations periodically. As you approach retirement or your financial goals change, adjust your strategy to reflect those changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
