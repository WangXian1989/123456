Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Prioritize Employer Matching**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (both Traditional and Roth, if eligible) if you have the means. These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly enhance your growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings are subject to capital gains taxes. This can be beneficial for short-term needs or if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket when withdrawing.

4. **Assess Your Time Horizon**: If youâ€™re investing for the long term (retirement), use tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, a taxable account might be more appropriate.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Withdrawals and Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**: Keep in mind that certain accounts (like 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs) require minimum withdrawals starting at age 72, which may affect your strategy as you approach retirement.

7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Your situation may change, so regularly review your allocations and adjust as needed based on performance, changing goals, or life circumstances.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match, then divert additional funds.
- **Traditional IRA**: Aim to max out contributions if eligible.
- **Roth IRA**: If your income allows, consider contributing to this for tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Account**: Use this for any extra savings or investments, particularly those you might need access to before retirement.

Always consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that fits your specific circumstances.
