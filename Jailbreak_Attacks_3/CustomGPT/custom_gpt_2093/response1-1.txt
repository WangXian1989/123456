Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit; it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, and grow tax-deferred.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. A Traditional IRA can reduce taxable income now.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow for more liquidity and easier access to funds without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding investments that are taxed at lower rates (like qualified dividends) here, and avoid high-turnover assets that generate short-term capital gains.

### Suggested Approach:
- **Short-Term Savings**: Keep enough cash in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies.
- **Retirement Accounts First**: Prioritize maxing out the 401(k) (up to the match) and then your IRA before putting money into taxable accounts.
- **Balance Growth and Risk**: Ensure that your asset allocation across these accounts aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.
