To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand Tax Implications
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out employer match.
   - **IRA:** Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), your tax treatment will differ. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Capital gains taxes apply here, so be mindful of when you sell investments.

### 2. Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon
   - **Short-term Needs:** Keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts or a traditional savings account.
   - **Long-term Growth:** Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts first if your timeline allows.

### Suggested Allocation
- **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Aim for at least the minimum needed to get the full match.
- **Contribute to an IRA:** Once the 401(k) match is maximized, consider funding your IRA.
- **Allocate Remaining Funds to Taxable Accounts:** Use any extra funds for investments in taxable accounts, focusing on long-term growth with lower turnover to minimize taxes.

### Review and Adjust Regularly
- Reassess your strategy annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and investment performance.

By following these guidelines, you'll create a balanced investment strategy tailored to your financial goals.
