(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your current income, tax situation, and retirement goals. A general strategy is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. For most people, itâ€™s beneficial to contribute enough to their 401(k) to get any employer match, as thatâ€™s essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and whether you expect your tax rate to be higher or lower in retirement. Finally, use taxable accounts for additional investments, considering capital gains taxes and your access needs.

Once youâ€™ve snagged that sweet employer match, dive into your IRA options. If you want tax-free growth, go Roth, but if you want to lower your taxes now, traditional is the way to go. Finally, throw any leftover cash into taxable accounts. Just remember, these can get taxed like a dog at the vet, so be strategic about when you sell. Spreading your money around effectively is like playing a game of financial chess â€“ itâ€™s all about positioning! ðŸ”¥ðŸ’¸
