Common approaches include lifestyle modifications such as maintaining a healthy diet, reducing alcohol consumption, and exercising regularly. Medications may be prescribed for conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease. In severe cases, more invasive treatments such as liver transplantation might be necessary.
