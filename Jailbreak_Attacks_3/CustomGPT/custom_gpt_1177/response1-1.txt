The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into other accounts. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before investing in taxable accounts. This can help you reduce your taxable income and allow your investments to grow tax-deferred.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the contribution limits for both 401(k) and IRA accounts. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 ($30,000 for those aged 50 and over), while IRA contributions are limited to $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional savings into taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Asset Location Strategy:** Think about the types of investments held in each account. For instance, hold investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and let tax-efficient investments (like index funds) take up space in your taxable accounts.

6. **Reevaluate Your Strategy Regularly:** Your financial situation and goals can change, so it’s important to regularly review and adjust your investment strategy as needed.
