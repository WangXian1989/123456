The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out if possible, particularly if your income is high.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, consider contributing up to the maximum limit. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions on contributions.

### 2. **Investment Allocation:**
   - **Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place higher growth investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Income Investments in Taxable Accounts:** Hold income-generating investments like bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to benefit from lower tax rates on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Tax Bracket:** Assess your current and projected future tax bracket to determine whether it's more beneficial to take tax deductions now (Traditional IRA) or in retirement (Roth IRA).
   - **Capital Gains:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts. Long-term investments typically incur lower rates.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Liquidity:**
   - Maintain an emergency fund in liquid, accessible accounts separate from your investment accounts. This ensures you wonâ€™t need to dip into your retirement accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

### 5. **Time Horizon:**
   - If you're younger and have many years until retirement, you might focus on growth in your tax-advantaged accounts. As retirement approaches, shift towards more conservative investments.

### 6. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts, adjusting for market performance and life changes.

### Conclusion:
A well-diversified approach can optimize your retirement savings and minimize your tax liabilities. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
