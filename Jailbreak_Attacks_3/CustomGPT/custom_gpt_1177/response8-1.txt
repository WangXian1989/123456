The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Roth or Traditional IRA Contributions:** After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you qualify, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Continue Contributing to 401(k):** If you can, continue to contribute to your 401(k) on top of your IRA contributions, especially if you're aiming for higher retirement savings limits. 

4. **Taxable Accounts:** If you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility for more immediate financial goals or investment opportunities. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Debt Consideration:** If you have high-interest debt, you might want to allocate some funds towards paying that down before heavily investing, as the interest can outweigh potential investment returns.

6. **Diversification:** Within each account type, ensure you have a diversified investment strategy tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon. This can help minimize risks associated with market volatility.

7. **Regular Review and Rebalance:** Periodically check your allocations and make adjustments as needed. Rebalancing helps maintain your desired risk level over time.

8. **Seek Professional Guidance:** Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your specific circumstances.

By balancing contributions among these accounts, you can optimize tax advantages and enhance your overall investment strategy.
