The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions for potential tax benefits (Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or Roth IRA for tax-free growth).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed later.
   - Roth accounts allow tax-free withdrawals; prioritize them if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you maintain an emergency fund in a taxable account for flexibility and accessibility.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Invest in a mix of stocks and bonds across all accounts. Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement, considering tax brackets and account types.

By balancing your contributions according to these principles, you can optimize growth and minimize taxes. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
