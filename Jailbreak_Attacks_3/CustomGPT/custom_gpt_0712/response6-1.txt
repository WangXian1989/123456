To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute the maximum allowable amounts to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax deferral on investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains, as they may be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Account Purpose**: Align asset allocation with the specific goals of each account (e.g., retirement, short-term saving).
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Higher-risk investments might be suitable for long-term accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) while safer investments could be held in taxable accounts if you might need access sooner.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy** 
   - **Prioritize Tax-Deferred Withdrawals**: Plan to withdraw from taxable accounts first during retirement to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow.
   - **Strategic Roth Conversions**: Consider converting traditional IRA assets to Roth IRA within lower income years to pay lower taxes now and avoid higher taxes later.

### Final Considerations
- **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Monitor the performance and allocation of your investments periodically.
- **Consultation with a Financial Advisor**: Tailor strategies to your individual financial situation for optimal results. 

By effectively managing your asset allocation across these accounts, you can enhance your overall financial growth and efficiency.
