Distributing your money across different accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. The choice between these accounts can depend on whether you anticipate being in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These can offer greater flexibility for withdrawals and investments, though you'll need to consider the tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Investment Choices**: In your tax-advantaged accounts, consider holding investments that generate higher taxable income, such as bonds or REITs. In your taxable accounts, you might prefer stocks or index funds that have the potential for long-term growth, which can be more tax-efficient.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Your age, risk tolerance, and investment timeline should also affect your allocation. Generally, younger investors may take more risks in stocks, while those closer to retirement may want to shift towards more stable investments.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolios across these accounts to ensure they align with your investment objectives and risk tolerance. 

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific circumstances.
