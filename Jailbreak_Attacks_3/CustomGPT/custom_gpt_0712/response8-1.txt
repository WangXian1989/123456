Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These should typically hold investments that generate lower tax burdens, such as index funds or ETFs. Avoid holding high-dividend stocks or actively managed funds here, as they may generate higher taxable income.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts. You can adjust your asset allocation depending on the account type. For example:
     - **401(k):** Consider a more aggressive allocation since withdrawals will be taxed.
     - **IRA:** Depending on whether itâ€™s a Traditional or Roth, your strategy may differ.
     - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on tax-efficient investments.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to stay aligned with your financial goals and market conditions.

### Consult a Financial Advisor
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can tailor strategies to your individual situation.

### Summary
Aim to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, maintain a diversified portfolio, consider the tax implications of your investments, and plan for withdrawals effectively.
