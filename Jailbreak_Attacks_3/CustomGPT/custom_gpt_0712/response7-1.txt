When distributing money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Aim to max out contributions to your traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and eligibility.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds that you might need access to before retirement age, as they don’t have the same penalties for withdrawals as retirement accounts.
   - **Asset Location:** Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)/IRA) to minimize tax liability.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid account for unexpected expenses, separate from your investment accounts.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Diversify your investments among these accounts to balance risk and return, considering your overall asset allocation strategy.

### 5. **Future Tax Considerations**
   - Think about your future tax rate compared to your current rate. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, consider more Roth contributions in your IRA.

### 6. **Periodic Review and Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to keep your asset allocation aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

This approach will help maximize growth potential while managing tax implications over the long term.
