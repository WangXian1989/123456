Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money). Aim to max out contributions if possible, as these contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute the maximum allowed. Choose a Traditional IRA for tax deductions now or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement depending on your tax situation.

2. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), lean more heavily into tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals, consider a taxable account since accessing funds can be more flexible.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and market outlook.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - In taxable accounts, hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains.
   - Place investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized guidance that considers your entire financial picture, including tax implications, investment strategies, and retirement plans.

By strategically distributing your money and regularly reviewing your plan, you can maximize growth while managing tax liabilities effectively.
