Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, age, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match firstâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals later.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or long-term investments.
   - Consider placing higher tax-efficiency assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Keep an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account, separate from your investment accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure you have a mix of stocks and bonds in all types of accounts to balance risk and returns.

5. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Set up automatic contributions to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

6. **Review Annually**:
   - Assess and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances is also a good idea.
