(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer tax benefits. Hereâ€™s a simplified approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, first contribute enough to get the full match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA for further tax advantages.
3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: After IRA, return to your 401(k) and contribute up to the annual limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings or investments, especially if you need liquidity or want to invest in assets not suitable for retirement accounts.

Itâ€™s important to assess your specific financial situation, perhaps with a financial advisor.

1. **Grab That Employer Match**: First off, if your employer matches 401(k) contributions, hustle and put in enough to snag that free money. Thatâ€™s basically free cash!
2. **IRA Magic**: Next, zoom into an IRA. You canâ€™t beat those tax advantages. If youâ€™re eligible for Roth IRA, dive in for tax-free growth. Max it out if you can! 
3. **Crank Up the 401(k)**: Then, pump more into your 401(k) until you hit the contribution cap. You want to stuff as much into that bad boy as possible because pre-tax contributions are your friend!
4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Finally, any leftover cash? Throw it into taxable accounts for some flexibility and liquid cash for non-retirement goals. Just watch those capital gains!
