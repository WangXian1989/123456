Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, investment goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy to consider:

### 1. Contribute to Your 401(k) Up to the Match
- **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and provides immediate growth.

### 2. Maximize Your IRA Contributions
- **IRA Limits**: Contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth) up to the annual limit. This can provide tax advantages (tax-deferred growth for traditional IRAs or tax-free withdrawals for Roth IRAs).
- **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. Continue Funding Your 401(k)
- **Beyond the Match**: If you have additional funds after maximizing your IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
- **High Contribution Limits**: 401(k) plans often have higher contribution limits than IRAs.

### 4. Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility
- **Short-Term Goals**: If you anticipate needing funds before retirement (like buying a home or funding education), consider using a taxable account. 
- **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. Assess Your Tax Situation
- **Tax Bracket**: Consider your current and future tax brackets. Balancing tax-deferred growth (401(k), IRA) with taxable accounts can help manage your tax burden.
- **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how and when you'll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes.

### 6. Review Asset Allocation
- **Investment Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.
- **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Conclusion
The ideal distribution will vary based on individual circumstances, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique financial goals and situation.
