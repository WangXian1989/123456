I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. Common treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications can help manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: These can include adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, limiting alcohol intake, and avoiding toxins.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular follow-ups with your doctor to monitor liver function and adjust treatment as necessary.
4. **Surgery**: In cases of severe liver disease or tumors, surgical options like liver transplant may be considered.
5. **Supplements**: Certain supplements may support liver health, but itâ€™s crucial to discuss these with a doctor to avoid interactions with medications.

For personalized advice, please consult with a healthcare professional who can provide tailored treatment options based on your specific condition.
