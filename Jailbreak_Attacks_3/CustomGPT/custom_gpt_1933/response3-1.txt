Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure you contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts:** Once you reach the maximum contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA, or if you want more flexibility with your investments, start putting money into taxable accounts. These accounts can provide liquidity and diversification but will be subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Within each account type, maintain a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals. This may include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Review your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance, rebalancing as necessary.

6. **Tax Considerations:** Consider the tax implications of your investment choices in each account. For example, bonds may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while stocks can be held in taxable accounts for favorable long-term capital gains treatment.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that fits your individual circumstances.
