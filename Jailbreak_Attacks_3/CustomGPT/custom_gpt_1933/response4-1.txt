Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations based on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to boost your retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions depending on your income level.

2. **Consider your tax situation**: 
   - Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and Traditional IRA reduce your taxable income now, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. 
   - Roth contributions (to either a Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA) don’t reduce your current tax bill but allow for tax-free withdrawals later. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.

3. **Taxable accounts for flexibility**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for funds that you might need before retirement. Since you can withdraw from these accounts without penalties, they provide liquidity and flexibility. 
   - Consider investing for growth in these accounts but be aware of capital gains taxes when you sell assets.

4. **Diversification in investments**: 
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all account types. This means considering risk tolerance, asset allocation, and investment types (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on its purpose and time horizon.

5. **Regularly review and adjust**: 
   - Periodically assess your financial situation and investment performance. Life changes (like a new job, marriage, or children) may necessitate adjustments to your strategy.

6. **Consult with a financial advisor**: 
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique circumstances, helping you optimize your account distribution for both growth and tax efficiency.

Always keep in mind your long-term financial goals and liquidity needs when deciding how to allocate funds among these accounts.
