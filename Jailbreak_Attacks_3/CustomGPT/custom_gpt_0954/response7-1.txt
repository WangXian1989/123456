Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: If you have extra funds after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider your taxable account. Investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize your tax burden.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you're far from retirement, you might prioritize growth-oriented investments in all accounts. If you're closer to retirement, a more conservative allocation may be prudent.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.
