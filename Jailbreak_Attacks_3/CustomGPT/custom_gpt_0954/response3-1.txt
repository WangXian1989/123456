Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current versus expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t have tax advantages, but you can access funds without penalties. Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Build an Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have savings for emergencies, ideally covering 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

5. **Adjust Based on Goals**: If retirement is far off, you might favor higher-risk investments in your 401(k) and IRA. If you're closer to retirement, consider more stable investments.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and those with favorable capital gains treatment in taxable accounts.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws change. Consulting a financial advisor may provide personalized guidance.
