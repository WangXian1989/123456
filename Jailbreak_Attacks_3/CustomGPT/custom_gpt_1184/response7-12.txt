I'm not a doctor, but here are some general options that are often considered for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function tests can help manage conditions effectively.

4. **Alternative Therapies**: Supplements like milk thistle are sometimes used, but be sure to consult a doctor before starting any new treatment.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, options like a liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and a tailored treatment plan.
