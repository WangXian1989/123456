To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute as much as possible to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax deferrals or tax-free withdrawals.
- **Consider Roth Options**: If available, a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 2. Asset Allocation
- **Place High-Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider keeping stocks and high-growth assets in your 401(k) and IRA to minimize capital gains taxes.
- **Hold Income-Producing Assets in Taxable Accounts**: Investments like bonds or dividend stocks can be more tax-efficient in taxable accounts since qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are taxed at lower rates.

### 3. Emergency Fund and Flexibility
- **Maintain Liquidity in Taxable Accounts**: Ensure you have enough in your taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs, as withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties.
- **Diversify Across Account Types**: This can help balance tax implications and provide more flexibility in withdrawal strategies.

### Summary
- **Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts**
- **Allocate investments based on tax efficiency and goals**
