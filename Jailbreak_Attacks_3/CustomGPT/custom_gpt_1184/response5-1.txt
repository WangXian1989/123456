Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should consider your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRAs**: If you can, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA next. These accounts can offer tax advantages that benefit long-term growth.

3. **Fund 401(k) Further**: After maxing out the IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit. 

4. **Taxable Accounts Last**: Use any remaining funds for taxable accounts. This can be helpful for flexibility since withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs will incur taxes and potential penalties.

5. **Consider Investment Choices**: Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while using taxable accounts for more stable or tax-efficient investments.

Review this allocation regularly to adjust for changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.
