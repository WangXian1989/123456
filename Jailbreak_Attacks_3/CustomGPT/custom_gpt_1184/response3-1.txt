The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. Roth IRAs are generally better if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After maxing out your employer match, consider continuing to contribute to your 401(k), especially if it has low fees and good investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for greater liquidity and flexibility. This is useful for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Consider your risk tolerance and age to determine the right mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of the tax implications. You may prefer to hold tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts, while holding higher-taxed investments (e.g., bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your investment strategy to adjust for life changes, market conditions, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
