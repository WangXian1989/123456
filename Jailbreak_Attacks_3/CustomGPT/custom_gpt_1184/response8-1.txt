To effectively distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 
   - **Traditional IRA**: This can also reduce your taxable income, similar to a 401(k).

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for higher-growth investments (stocks) since you wonâ€™t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding income-generating assets (like bonds) to manage tax liabilities effectively.

4. **Withdrawal Planning**: 
   - Plan for required minimum distributions (RMDs) in retirement, generally starting at age 73, and strategize which accounts to withdraw from first.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to reduce risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your allocations and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your target asset mix.

Consulting a financial advisor is also recommended to tailor these strategies to your unique financial situation.
