Distributing money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be guided by your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match—it's essentially free money. If possible, max out your contributions to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **IRA:** Consider making the maximum contribution to your IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and goals). Roth IRAs can offer tax-free growth, which can be advantageous in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts can hold investments that generate capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. They’re best for investments that you may want to access before retirement or for tax-efficient strategies.
   - **Investment Type:** Consider placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to delay taxation on gains. More conservative investments can go into taxable accounts to minimize tax hits from interest income.

### 3. **Emergency Funds and Short-Term Needs**
   - Keep a portion of your funds in accessible, low-risk investments in your taxable accounts to cover emergencies or short-term needs without penalties.

### 4. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and financial objectives.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Review your distributions and investment performance regularly to adjust based on market conditions, life changes, and financial goals.

### 6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your individual circumstances, including income level, retirement age, and investment knowledge.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** 10-15% of your income, maximizing employer match first.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions (currently $6,500 or $7,500 if 50+).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate remaining funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on investment vehicles that suit your timeline (e.g., index funds for long-term growth).

By following these strategies, you can create a well-structured financial plan that maximizes growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
