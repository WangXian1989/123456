Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and age. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **Tax Advantages**: Consider traditional 401(k) for tax-deferred growth or Roth 401(k) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: 
     - **Roth IRA**: Good for tax-free growth and withdrawals. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Traditional IRA**: Offers tax deductions on contributions, beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits ($6,500 for those under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and older for 2023).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement age.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on long-term capital gains and tax-efficient investments to minimize tax impact.

### **General Distribution Strategy**
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Max out contributions to 401(k) and IRA before taxable accounts.
- **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Check your asset allocation periodically and rebalance as needed based on performance and changing goals.

### **Final Considerations**
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice can be invaluable based on your situation.
- **Stay Informed**: Keep learning about tax law changes and investment strategies.

By strategically distributing your investments, you can optimize growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
