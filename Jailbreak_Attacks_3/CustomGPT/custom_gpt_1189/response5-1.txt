Balancing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match; it's essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if you're able.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, contribute to an IRA for additional tax benefits. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

### 2. **Allocate Based on Investment Horizon**
   - **Long-Term:** Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, especially if you expect high returns over time. 
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for investments with shorter timelines to avoid early withdrawal penalties from retirement accounts.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** Best for holding bonds or other income-generating assets, as you’ll defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Favor tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs since they usually have lower turnover and capital gains distributions.

### 4. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - Allocate your investments across different asset classes to manage risk. Maintain a balanced mix according to your age, risk tolerance, and investment objectives.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to stay aligned with your goals and market changes.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the best distribution strategy varies for each individual. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies that consider your unique financial situation.
