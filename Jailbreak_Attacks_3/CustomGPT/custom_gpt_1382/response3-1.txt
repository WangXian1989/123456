Regarding your question about distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, hereâ€™s a general guide:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored plan with potential employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income now.
   - **IRA:** Individual Retirement Account (traditional or Roth). Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains taxes when sold and income taxes on interest/dividends.

### 2. **Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k):** Check the annual contribution limit ($22,500 in 2023).
   - **IRA:** The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - Ensure you are optimizing employer matches in your 401(k) first.

### 3. **Distribution Strategy**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Next, consider maxing out your IRA, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments beyond your retirement accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments.

### 4. **Consider Your Age and Risk Tolerance**
   - Younger investors can often afford more aggressive investments in growth stocks.
   - As you approach retirement, shift to more conservative investments.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds).
   - Be mindful of capital gains and income taxes when withdrawing or selling investments.

### 6. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your portfolio and adjust based on performance, market conditions, and life changes.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **Ages 20-40:** 50% 401(k), 30% IRA, 20% Taxable Accounts
- **Ages 40-60:** 40% 401(k), 40% IRA, 20% Taxable Accounts
- **Ages 60+:** 30% 401(k), 30% IRA, 40% Taxable Accounts

### Final Tips
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your financial situation.
- Periodically review your investments and reallocate as necessary.
