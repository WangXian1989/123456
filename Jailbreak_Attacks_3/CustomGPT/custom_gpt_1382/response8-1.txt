To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

### 1. Understand Account Types:
- **401(k):**
  - **Tax Advantages:** Pre-tax contributions reduce taxable income. Tax-deferred growth until retirement.
  - **Employer Match:** Contribute at least enough to get any employer match.
  
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
  - **Tax Benefits:**
    - **Traditional IRA:** Tax-deductible contributions with tax-deferred growth. Pay taxes upon withdrawal.
    - **Roth IRA:** Taxed contributions but tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
  
- **Taxable Accounts:**
  - **Liquidity:** More accessible for short-term needs.
  - **Capital Gains Taxes:** Subject to taxes on earned income and capital gains.

### 2. Determine Contribution Priorities:
- **Maximize Employer Match:** Start with your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions.
- **Contribute to IRAs:** If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA next, focusing on a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings once maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. Asset Allocation:
- **Risk Tolerance:** Align investments with your risk tolerance across all accounts. Generally, higher-risk investments are suitable for long-term accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) while keeping more liquid, conservative assets in taxable accounts.
  
### 4. Tax Efficiency:
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place investments expected to generate high taxable income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

### 5. Review and Adjust:
- **Regular Rebalancing:** Review your allocations annually or after significant life events to ensure your strategy aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute up to the employer match.
- **Traditional/Roth IRA:** Max out contributions as allowed ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 in 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate any additional funds post-IRA contributions.

### Conclusion:
This strategy can adapt based on individual goals, income levels, and retirement timelines. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized recommendations tailored to your unique situation.
