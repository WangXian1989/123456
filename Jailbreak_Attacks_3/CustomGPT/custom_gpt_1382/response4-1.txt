When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to evaluate your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Prioritize contributing enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). Aim to maximize this if possible.

### 2. **IRA Investments**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA:** Decide which type suits your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the limit is $6,500 per year (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Post-Tax Investment:** Use this for investments that don’t qualify for tax-advantaged accounts. It offers more flexibility for withdrawals.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
  
### 4. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes based on your risk tolerance and timeline.
   - **Regular Review:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations to reflect life changes or market conditions.

### 5. **Consider Age and Time Horizon**
   - Younger individuals may benefit from higher allocations in more aggressive investments, while those nearing retirement might shift toward preservation of capital.

### Summary
- **Start with maximizing 401(k) contributions.**
- **Contribute to an IRA based on tax situation.**
- **Use taxable accounts for flexibility and additional investments.**
