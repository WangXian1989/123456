When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings such as interest, dividends, and capital gains are subject to taxes in the year they are earned.

### 2. **Focus on Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the near future.

### 3. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA**: The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).
   - Make sure to contribute up to the employer match in your 401(k) if available.

### 4. **Balance Investments**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for high-growth investments (to defer taxes).
   - Keep more stable investments in taxable accounts for better liquidity and tax efficiency.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Regularly review and adjust your investment allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.
