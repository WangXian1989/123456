Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Age**: How far are you from retirement?
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Are you comfortable with market volatility?
   - **Tax Considerations**: What’s your current tax bracket and anticipated future bracket?

### 2. **Prioritize Accounts**
   - **401(k)**:
     - **Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is free money!
     - **Contribution Limits**: Check the maximum contribution limits (e.g., $22,500 for 2024; $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **IRA**:
     - Consider whether a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA is more beneficial depending on your tax situation (e.g., pre-tax vs. after-tax contributions).
     - Contribution limits are lower than 401(k) limits (e.g., $6,500 for 2024; $7,500 if 50+).
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Use for investments beyond retirement contributions.
     - More flexible for short-term goals or needs, though you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 3. **Distribution Strategy**
   - Max out your 401(k) contributions to benefit from tax deferral and employer matching.
   - If you can, contribute the maximum to an IRA, especially if you’re eligible for a Roth IRA due to tax-free growth benefits.
   - Allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### 4. **Adjust Annually**
   - Review your investment allocations yearly based on performance and changes in income or tax laws.
   - Rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired risk level.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice that considers complex factors such as investments, insurance, and estate planning.

This structured approach maximizes your retirement savings while considering the tax implications of each account type. Adjust according to personal circumstances and goals.
