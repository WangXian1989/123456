Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are tax-deferred, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal during retirement. Consider maxing out employer matches first, as it's essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments at a profit. Consider holding investments for at least a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 2. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Allocate a higher risk investment in tax-advantaged accounts where growth is prioritized, and lower risk in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.
   - **Diversification:** Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts, ensuring diverse asset allocation to mitigate risk.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for your retirement income stream by considering when to withdraw from each account type. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts last.

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure an adequate emergency fund is in place before heavily investing. This should ideally be in a liquid, taxable account.

### 5. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account to maximize tax advantages.

### Summary:
- **Maximize employer matches** in your 401(k) first.
- **Choose between traditional vs. Roth IRAs** based on current and future tax predictions.
- **Diversify investments** and plan withdrawal strategies carefully to minimize taxes in retirement.
