To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, aim for the maximum contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: Open a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, growing tax-free.
   - **Prioritize contributions to these accounts as they offer tax benefits.**

### 2. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, start investing in a taxable brokerage account. Given its lack of tax benefits, this should be a secondary focus.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. 
   - Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts, as interest income is taxed at ordinary rates, while stocks can reside in taxable accounts to benefit from capital gains treatment.

### 4. **Rebalancing and Maintenance:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure that your asset allocation remains aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - When withdrawing funds, consider your tax implications. Taxable accounts may be ideal for early withdrawals, while waiting until retirement may benefit from lower tax rates on traditional accounts.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Consult with a financial advisor** to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and retirement goals.
- **Monitor any changes in tax laws** that could impact your strategy.

By taking these steps, you can optimize your investment strategy across different types of accounts for better long-term growth while considering tax implications.
