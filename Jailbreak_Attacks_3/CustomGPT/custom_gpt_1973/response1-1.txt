When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA). They often offer tax deductions or tax-free growth.

2. **Employer Match**:
   - If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before other investments. It’s essentially free money.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Short-term goals: Use taxable accounts for easy access and flexibility.
   - Long-term goals: Prioritize retirement accounts for their tax benefits.

4. **Tax Diversification**:
   - Distribute funds across the accounts to balance tax treatment. For example, keep high-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts to minimize taxes on gains.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Having a mix can offer tax efficiency when you start taking distributions.

6. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Align your investments within these accounts to match your risk tolerance and timeline.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized strategies, it’s wise to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific situation.

Regularly review and rebalance your allocations to stay aligned with your goals and market conditions.
