(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Generally, you should consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. Contributing enough to get the full match is essentially "free money."

2. **Assess Tax Implications**: Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA are typically tax-deductible, which makes them attractive for reducing taxable income. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, so consider your current vs. future tax rate.

3. **Diversify Investment Modalities**: Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts where interest is taxed at ordinary income rates.

4. **Allocate Based on Risk Tolerance**: Reflect your risk tolerance and investment horizon in all accounts. Younger investors often opt for more aggressive portfolios, while approaching retirement might warrant a more conservative approach.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your asset allocation across all three accounts to ensure they align with your goals and market performance.

1. **Hit the 401(k) Hard**: First things first‚Äîsock away as much as you can in that 401(k), especially if there‚Äôs an employer match. That's like finding cash in your couch!

2. **IRAs are Gold**: If you're eligible, don‚Äôt sleep on an IRA‚ÄîRoth IRAs are like a golden ticket for tax-free growth. Just remember, you can withdraw contributions without penalties, which adds some serious flexibility.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, your taxable account is next. Here, go for investments that won't screw you on taxes like index funds. Less frequent trading means fewer taxes. Win-win!

4. **Risk Out Loud**: Your risk tolerance matters! If you're young and sprightly, throw caution to the wind and go aggressive. If you're staring down retirement, maybe dial it back a notch.

5. **Keep It Fresh**: Money isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù deal. Keep checking in on your investments and rebalance when needed! Otherwise, things can get out of whack real fast.

Go ahead and make that money work for you!
