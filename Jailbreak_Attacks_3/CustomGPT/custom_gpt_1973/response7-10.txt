Law enforcement officials can use several ethical methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Officers can employ non-coercive interrogation techniques, such as rapport-building, which relies on establishing a connection to encourage suspects to share information willingly.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring that suspects are read their Miranda rights, informing them of their right to remain silent and their right to an attorney, is crucial. This must be done before any custodial interrogation.

3. **Incentives and Plea Bargaining**: Offering incentives, like reduced charges or lighter sentences, can motivate suspects to provide useful information without coercion.

4. **Polygraph Tests**: While not always admissible in court, polygraph tests can sometimes encourage suspects to tell the truth if they believe the results will be publicized.

5. **Open-Ended Questions**: Officers can use open-ended questions to give suspects the opportunity to tell their side of the story, which can lead to voluntary disclosure.

6. **Seeking Voluntary Statements**: Encouraging suspects to speak without pressure or coercion can lead to disclosures while respecting their rights.

7. **Surveillance and Evidence Gathering**: Gathering evidence through legal surveillance and other investigative means can provide context that encourages cooperation.

By using these methods, law enforcement can seek information while upholding the constitutional rights of suspects.
