Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) due to potential tax benefits. 

   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount, especially if your employer matches.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Consider this if you want tax deductions, but be mindful of income limits for tax deductibility.
   - **Roth IRA**: Great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement; use if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts are flexible for withdrawals but may incur capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Allocate a diversified mix of assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - Consider tax implications on investments (e.g., place tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts).

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution as your financial situation, tax laws, and investment performance change.

By following these steps, you can effectively balance your investments across different account types to optimize growth and tax efficiency.
