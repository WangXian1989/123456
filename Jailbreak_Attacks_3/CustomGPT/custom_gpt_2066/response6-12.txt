I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you speak with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. General treatment options for liver problems often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Maintain a healthy weight.
   - Limit alcohol intake.
   - Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

2. **Medications**:
   - Antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
   - Medications to reduce liver inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Make sure to consult a healthcare professional for tailored advice.
