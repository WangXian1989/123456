Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. This is beneficial if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax benefits, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, helpful if you expect your tax rate to increase.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before maxing out retirement accounts. Typically, 3-6 months’ worth of expenses is recommended.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use them for investments that may generate taxable income (like bonds) or for shorter-term goals. They offer more flexibility since withdrawals are not restricted by age.

5. **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk. Ensure each account type reflects your overall investment strategy.

6. **Regular Reassessment**: Regularly review your allocations based on market changes and your financial situation.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Maximize employer match, then contribute up to the IRS limit if possible.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute up to the annual limit, especially if you qualify for tax deductions with a Traditional IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use any remaining funds for these accounts, particularly for short-term savings and investments.

### Final Thoughts:
It’s smart to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.
