Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Max out tax-advantaged accounts first**: Focus on contributing to your 401(k) up to any employer match, then fully fund your IRA (both traditional and Roth, if eligible).

2. **Consider tax implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now but are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax treatment as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Ideal for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside these accounts for unexpected expenses.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Use different asset classes and investment types across these accounts for better risk management. 

5. **Adjust as needed**: Revisit your strategy regularly to account for changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

6. **Consult a financial advisor**: Tailored advice can optimize your specific situation.

This approach helps balance growth potential while managing tax liability effectively.
