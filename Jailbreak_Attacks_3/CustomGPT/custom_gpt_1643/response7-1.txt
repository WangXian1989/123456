To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match; this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After maximizing the match, contribute to your IRA (Roth or Traditional) to benefit from tax advantages.
   - Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.

### 3. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type:
     - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older for 2023).
     - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older).

### 4. **Balance Tax Implications**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or dividends to manage tax liabilities efficiently.
   - Keep high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Financial Goals**
   - If you aim for retirement in the near term, favor more stable investments.
   - For long-term growth, invest in a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance.

### Summary
1. **Maximize 401(k) match**.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**.
3. **Monitor contribution limits**.
4. **Consider tax implications in taxable accounts**.
5. **Adjust based on your goals and risk tolerance**.
