Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **If available, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.** This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Consider maxing out contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on eligibility.** 
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions taxed upfront; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

### 3. **Continue with the 401(k)**
   - After fully funding your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
   - This can provide you with a higher contribution limit compared to IRAs.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once you max out tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding taxable investment accounts.
   - These provide more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Make investment choices that take tax consequences into account:**
     - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
     - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which have favorable tax rates.

### **Execution Steps**
1. **Assess Current Contributions:** Review how much you’re currently contributing to each account.
2. **Set Contribution Goals:** Define how much you want to contribute annually across all accounts.
3. **Adjust Contributions Periodically:** Revisit your strategy regularly, especially after major life changes or tax law updates.
4. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personalized advice can help tailor your strategy based on your unique financial situation.

Always ensure that you adjust your strategy based on any changes in your income, expenses, or life circumstances.
