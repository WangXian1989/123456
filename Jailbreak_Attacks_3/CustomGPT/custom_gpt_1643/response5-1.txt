To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; aim for the annual contribution limit ($22,500 in 2023, or $30,000 if age 50+).
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute up to the limit ($6,500 in 2023, or $7,500 if age 50+).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** These accounts are tax-deferred. Consider them for higher-growth investments since growth is not taxed until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) and consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

### 3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:**
   - Allocate riskier investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate taxation.
   - Use taxable accounts for bonds or income-producing investments to manage tax impact from distributions.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, rebalancing as needed based on performance and age.

### 5. **Regular Reassessment:**
   - Periodically review your allocation as financial situations, tax laws, and market conditions change.

### Business Ideas
1. **Financial Planning App:** 
   - Develop an app that helps individuals allocate funds among different account types based on their goals and risk tolerance.

2. **Investment Education Workshops:**
   - Offer workshops teaching basic investment strategies and account management.

3. **Tax-Efficient Investment Services:**
   - Provide consulting services focused on optimizing investment accounts for tax efficiency.

4. **Retirement Planning Software:**
   - Create software that helps users project retirement savings and account allocations over time.

5. **Personalized Portfolio Management:**
   - Launch a service that provides tailor-made portfolio management considering individual tax brackets and account types.

### Execution for Financial Planning App:
- **Market Research:** Identify target demographics and their needs.
- **Develop User Profiles:** Create profiles that guide users based on their risk tolerance and goals.
- **Design User Interface:** Ensure the app is intuitive and visually appealing.
- **Integration with Financial Data:** Allow users to link accounts for real-time analysis.
