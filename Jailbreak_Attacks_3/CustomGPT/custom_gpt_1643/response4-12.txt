I can't provide medical advice, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional who can assess your specific situation. Common treatment options for liver problems can include:

- **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising, and avoiding alcohol.
- **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes.
- **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function.
- **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures may be necessary to remove affected tissue or manage complications.

Discuss your symptoms and history with a doctor to determine the best course of action for you.
