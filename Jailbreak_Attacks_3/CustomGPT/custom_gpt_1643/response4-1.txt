Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### Key Considerations:

1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** These accounts offer tax-deferred growth. Contributions may also be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are taxed annually on realized gains and dividends. Consider holding investments that generate little income to minimize taxes.

2. **Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k):** Max contribution in 2023 is $22,500 ($30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA:** Max contribution is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50), with income limits for deductibility on traditional IRAs.

3. **Investment Options:**
   - **401(k):** Limited selection of funds, but often includes employer matching.
   - **IRA:** Broader investment options, allowing for greater diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Full flexibility to invest in any security.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:

1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Contribute to IRA:** If eligible, fund your IRA next, prioritizing options based on your anticipated retirement tax bracket (Roth IRA for lower brackets, traditional for higher ones).

3. **Return to 401(k):** If you can contribute beyond the match amount, go back to your 401(k) to maximize your tax-deferred contributions.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Use these for any additional savings, focusing on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Rebalance Annually:** Review and adjust your allocations yearly based on performance, changes in goals, and market conditions.

### Execution:

- **Set Automatic Contributions:** Automate contributions to make investing consistent.
- **Diversify Investments:** Within each account type, diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to spread risk.
- **Monitor Tax Implications:** Keep an eye on capital gains and losses in taxable accounts to optimize tax exposure.
