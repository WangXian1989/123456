The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your IRA and 401(k) before putting money into taxable accounts. For 2023, the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older), and the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but potentially being taxed at withdrawal. Roth accounts (if available) use after-tax dollars, making withdrawals tax-free in retirement.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Consider the types of investments in each account. Taxable accounts can hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to manage capital gains, while holding tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts can be a strategic move.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution and asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, it's often best to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific needs.

Ultimately, the right mix will depend on your individual circumstances!
