I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information. The best treatment options for liver problems often depend on the specific condition you're facing. Common treatments can include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in severe cases, surgery or liver transplantation. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice based on your medical history and current condition. Take care of yourself!
