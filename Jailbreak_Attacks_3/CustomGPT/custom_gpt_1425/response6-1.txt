To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits and Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize employer match first, as it's essentially free money. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you qualify for tax-free withdrawals in retirement; otherwise, consider a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize these for investments that may need more flexibility, such as stocks or mutual funds. These accounts donâ€™t have contribution limits but can be subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Assess Investment Strategy and Time Horizon**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Align your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) with your risk tolerance across all accounts. 
   - **Time Frame**: If you are closer to retirement, prioritize safer investments in your 401(k) and IRA to protect your capital.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure you have a mix of asset types across all accounts to mitigate risks and enhance growth potential.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and keep tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities on capital gains. 

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your investment goals and risk tolerance. Adjust contributions based on performance and market conditions.

By considering these aspects, you can create a personalized distribution plan that maximizes growth and minimizes taxes tailored to your financial situation and goals.
