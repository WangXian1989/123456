Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and filing status, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are made with after-tax dollars, and you'll owe taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains when you sell investments.

3. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to benefit from tax deferral.
   - Keep more stable investments (like bonds or savings) in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities effectively.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place (typically 3-6 months of expenses) before aggressively investing.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on market conditions, performance, and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, consider speaking with a certified financial planner.

Every individual's situation is different, so it's essential to consider your own financial goals and consult with a professional if needed.
