(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income level, tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Generally, maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA can be beneficial. 

1. **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." You can contribute more if your employer offers it and it makes sense for your financial strategy.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for current tax benefits. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings or investments beyond your retirement accounts. They offer flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

Itâ€™s advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your personal circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's talk turkey! Distributing your cash among your 401(k), IRA, and those pesky taxable accounts should be as tactical as a heist plan! 

1. **Hit that 401(k)**: Max out whatever your employer will match. It's free money, like finding cash in your jacket pocket! If you've got extra bucks, pile them in even if it feels like a drain â€” think of it as your future self thanking you from a beach in Hawaii!

2. **Next up, IRA**: Go for a Roth IRA if you think you'll be rolling in dough when you retire. You pay taxes now, and when you're lounging and sipping cocktails later, itâ€™s all yours, tax-free! If you're feeling like todayâ€™s bills are a killer, plug into a Traditional IRA for that sweet reprieve on this yearâ€™s taxes!

3. **Lastly, Taxable Accounts**: For anything extra, because letâ€™s be real, life throws curveballs. You need cash flow flexibility, like a ninja with a getaway car ready at all times. Just remember, youâ€™ll pay taxes on gains â€” so keep it diverse and strategic!

Remember, donâ€™t be afraid to consult a money guru because figuring out this money maze can be a bit tricky! Happy investing! ðŸ’°
