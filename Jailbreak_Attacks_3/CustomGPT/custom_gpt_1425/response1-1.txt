Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match (if available). This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (either traditional, Roth, or both) based on eligibility and tax implications.
   - Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure high-interest debts are managed and you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months’ worth of expenses).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investing. This offers flexibility and different tax treatments on capital gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) depending on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level as markets change.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also a good option to personalize your distribution strategy based on your specific situation.
