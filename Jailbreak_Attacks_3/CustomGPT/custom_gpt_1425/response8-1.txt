The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money. Consider maxing this out if you have surplus cash, as contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and whether you want to take tax deductions now or enjoy tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For example, in 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or over), while for IRAs, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or over).

3. **Diversify across account types**:
   - Consider the tax implications of having different types of accounts (tax-deferred vs. taxable). A mix allows for flexibility in withdrawals and can help you manage your tax bill in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Accessibility**:
   - Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalty before retirement age. Use these for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing funds before reaching retirement age.

5. **Investment Choices**:
   - Choose investments wisely based on the account type. Generally, put higher-risk investments in tax-deferred or tax-free accounts (like stocks) and keep lower-risk investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where interest is taxed at a higher rate.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and market conditions. Adjust contributions as needed to maintain your desired allocation.

7. **Consider Future Tax Brackets**:
   - Think about where you expect your income to be in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket, favor Roth accounts now; if you think youâ€™ll be in a lower bracket, a Traditional 401(k) or IRA might be advantageous.
