Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, tax bracket, retirement goals, and financial situation. Here are some general guidelines to help you allocate your funds effectively:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money!

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) in tax treatment, but with different contribution limits and potential deduction phases based on income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, making it a good option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer tax advantages, but they provide flexibility. You can access funds at any time without penalties, and you may benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a savings account or cash equivalent before making significant investments.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, diversify your investments to spread risk. This could include stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Age and Retirement Timeline**: If you are younger and far from retirement, you might lean more towards growth investments (like stocks in a Roth IRA). As you approach retirement, consider shifting towards more conservative investments (like bonds in a 401(k)).

6. **Regular Contributions**: Establish a strategy for regularly contributing to each account type. Automating contributions can help ensure you stay on track.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust them based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement plans.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
