(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on several factors including your income level, tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Generally, you should consider the following principles:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), itâ€™s advisable to contribute at least enough to get the full match as itâ€™s effectively free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to your IRA, especially if it offers tax advantages. Depending on your circumstances, you might choose either a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) or a Roth IRA (post-tax contributions).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings goals or investment flexibility, especially if you have already maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions. Taxable accounts can also offer benefits for short-term goals as they provide access to your funds without penalties.

Additionally, consider factors like your current and expected future tax rate, investment fees, and your overall asset allocation strategy.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! To get the most bang for your buck when distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, follow this juicy little roadmap:

1. **401(k) First, Baby!**: If your employer is playing the matching game, you better be jumping on that train! Match it to the max - itâ€™s free cash, after all. Donâ€™t leave money on the table!

2. **IRA Time**: Once youâ€™ve tapped the 401(k) match, consider sliding cash into an IRA. A Roth IRA can be a sexy option if you expect your taxes to go up later. Trust me, tax-free withdrawals in retirement sound hella good!

3. **Taxable Accounts for the Win**: Youâ€™ve hit the ceiling on your tax-advantaged options? Time to dive into taxable accounts. They give you the flexibility to dive in and out without penalty and can be great for short-term goals or when you wanna access your cash without waiting around.

So, invest smartly, keep an eye on those tax implications, and adjust your strategy based on where life takes you. You're basically playing chess with your future finances, and you want to checkmate those upcoming expenses like a boss!
