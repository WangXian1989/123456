Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If youâ€™re eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs give you tax deductions upfront.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Bonds and other interest-generating investments might be better placed in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to avoid higher taxes on interest income.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. This means not just in terms of asset classes (stocks, bonds) but also across different sectors and geographies.

5. **Consider Your Income Level**: If you expect your income to be higher in retirement, lean towards tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA). Conversely, if you expect lower income in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: Adjust your allocations based on your long-term financial goals. If you're closer to retirement, you might want a more conservative allocation.

Remember to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your changing financial situation and market conditions! And it might be worth consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
