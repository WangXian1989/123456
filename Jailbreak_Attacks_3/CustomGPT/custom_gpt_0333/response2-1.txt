Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debts, consider paying those down before investing significantly.

3. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: After your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you've contributed to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This provides flexibility for access to funds without early withdrawal penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a diversified asset allocation across all accounts, but adjust based on tax implications. For instance, consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on gains.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.
