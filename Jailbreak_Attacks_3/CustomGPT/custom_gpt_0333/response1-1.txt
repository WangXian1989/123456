To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out employer matches first as it’s “free money.” This account is tax-advantaged, so prioritize pre-tax contributions.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for investments that generate long-term capital gains (like stocks) to minimize tax impact.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxes on dividends and interest.
   - Consider bonds and income-generating assets in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends and long-term gains.

3. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Ensure you have enough in taxable accounts for short-term needs, as withdrawals from 401(k) and IRA may incur penalties if taken before retirement age.

4. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - If retirement is far off, lean more into aggressive growth in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - As you near retirement, gradually shift to more conservative investments to preserve capital.

5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - A personalized assessment based on your financial situation and goals can help refine your strategy.

Balancing between these accounts effectively can maximize your tax efficiency and investment growth.
