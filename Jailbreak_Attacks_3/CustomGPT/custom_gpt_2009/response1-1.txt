Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax bracket, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After securing the match, consider maxing out your IRA, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you still have funds available, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit. This reduces your taxable income and allows for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts can be used for goals not tied to retirement. Consider these for more flexible investment options or if you anticipate needing them in the near term.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of account type to manage risk effectively.

6. **Reassess Periodically**: Regularly review your allocations as your financial situation or goals change, ensuring alignment with your retirement strategy.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
