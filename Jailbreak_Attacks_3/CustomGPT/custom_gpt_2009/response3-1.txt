Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are key considerations for an effective strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit, as it's essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: Consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions (up to the annual limit) if you have high income and want to reduce your taxable income.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide upfront tax deductions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less tax liability (e.g., index funds or municipal bonds) to optimize after-tax returns. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Focus on tax-efficient ETFs or mutual funds within taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Hold bonds and high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid unfavorable tax treatment.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively. This includes asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

7. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
