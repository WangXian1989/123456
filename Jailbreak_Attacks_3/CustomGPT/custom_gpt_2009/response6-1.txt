To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types and Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed in the year of sale, with capital gains tax applying. 

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match limit. This is essentially “free money.”

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Once you've captured your employer match, consider maximizing contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your current tax bracket and future expectations.

4. **Balance Risk and Return**: 
   - Assess your investment strategy across all accounts. Consider a blend of stocks, bonds, and cash based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Consider Withdrawals and Future Needs**:
   - When planning for retirement income, consider how and when you will withdraw from each account type to minimize taxes and meet your cash flow needs.

### Summary:
- **Maximize 401(k) contributions** up to the employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA** next, based on your eligibility.
- **Invest in a taxable account** for additional flexibility as needed.

This approach allows for efficient growth while minimizing tax burdens over time.
