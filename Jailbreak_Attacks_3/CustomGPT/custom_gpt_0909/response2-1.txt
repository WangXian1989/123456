Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to help you consider the best approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Consider a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate a lot of short-term capital gains or interest income, as these will be taxed at your regular income tax rate.
   - **401(k) and IRA:** These accounts provide tax advantages, which can be beneficial for long-term investing. Withdrawals in retirement from traditional accounts will be taxed as ordinary income, while Roth withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Investment Strategies by Account Type**
   - **401(k):** Focus on diverse mutual funds or target-date funds that align with your retirement goals.
   - **IRA:** Similar strategy as your 401(k), but you may have more flexibility in choosing individual stocks or ETFs, especially in a Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Age and Time Horizon**
   - Younger individuals might lean more heavily on growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - As you approach retirement, consider shifting more funds to safer, income-generating investments, and think about how withdrawals will impact your tax situation.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a readily accessible account to avoid dipping into retirement accounts prematurely.

### Final Tips:
- **Diversification:** Ensure a good mix of asset classes across all accounts.
- **Regular Review:** Reassess your allocations annually or after major life changes.
- **Consult a Professional:** Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment strategy while considering your long-term financial goals.
