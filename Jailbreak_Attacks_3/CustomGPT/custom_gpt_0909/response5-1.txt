Distributing your money wisely among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Your IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate lower annual income (like index funds). Stocks held long-term can benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund and consider paying off high-interest debt before focusing too much on investing.

5. **Diversification**: Make sure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk.

6. **Review Regularly**: Financial situations change, so review and rebalance your portfolio regularly.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific circumstances.
