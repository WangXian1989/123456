Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors: your financial goals, tax implications, investment time horizon, and your current tax bracket. Here are some strategies to think about:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of it, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which means you won't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement. Consider maxing out contributions here if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you meet certain conditions. Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions now, with taxes due upon withdrawal. Choose based on your expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes on any profits, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals. Utilize this account for short-term goals or when you need access to funds without penalties.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If youâ€™re saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - For shorter-term goals (like buying a house or going on a trip), a taxable account might be more appropriate.

4. **Asset Location**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically assess your asset allocation and contribution levels across all accounts to ensure they align with your ongoing goals and risk tolerance.

These strategies can help you create a balanced approach to your investments, optimizing for growth and tax efficiency. Consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation can also provide personalized guidance.
