The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a basic strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**
   - If eligible, maximize your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages.

### 3. **Contribute Beyond Match to 401(k)**
   - After maxing out your IRA, direct additional savings to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 4. **Fund Taxable Accounts**
   - Use any remaining funds for taxable accounts. This provides flexibility for withdrawals and can be useful for short-term goals.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth accounts allow tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - Taxable accounts can take advantage of capital gains rates, which may be lower than ordinary income tax rates.

### 6. **Assess Your Risk Tolerance**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
