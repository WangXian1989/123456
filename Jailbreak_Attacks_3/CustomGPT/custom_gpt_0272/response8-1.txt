To optimally distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA). Aim to maximize these before allocating funds to taxable accounts.

3. **Investment Options**: Use your 401(k) for investment options that have high potential returns. In your IRA, consider more tax-efficient investments.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for future withdrawals. Generally, it's best to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all account types to minimize risk.

7. **Annual Review**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed based on changing goals or market conditions.
