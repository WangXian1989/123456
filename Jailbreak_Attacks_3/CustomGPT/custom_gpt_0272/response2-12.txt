I'm not a healthcare professional, but for liver problems, treatment options often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Healthy diet (low in fats, sugars, and alcohol).
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral medications for hepatitis.
   - Medications to manage symptoms or complications.

3. **Medical Procedures**: 
   - Procedures to remove blockages.
   - In some cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

It's essential to consult a healthcare provider for a personalized treatment plan.
