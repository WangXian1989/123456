To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, offering immediate tax benefits. Consider this account for high-income years.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but there are income limits for full deductibility if you also have a 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Ideal for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or for funds you may need before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments here.

3. **Investment Horizons and Goals**:
   - Determine your investment goals (retirement, buying a house, emergency fund) and timeline for each.
   - Generally, funds with longer horizons can be more aggressively invested (e.g., equities), while short-term goals may require more conservative investments (e.g., bonds or cash equivalents).

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Balance your portfolio across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk. Each account can hold different assets based on your overall investment strategy.

5. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - For personalized advice taking into account your unique financial situation, goals, and tax implications.

By following these guidelines, you can create a distribution strategy that optimally leverages the benefits of each account type.
