(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, you may want to maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if they offer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money. Following that, contributing to an IRA can provide additional tax advantages, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA. Finally, taxable accounts can be useful for more immediate goals or when you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

First off, if your 401(k) has a matching contribution, throw as much as you can into that bad boyâ€”it's like getting a bonus for doing your job! Then, hit your IRA next; a Roth IRA is killer for tax-free growth if you qualifyâ€”go for it! After you've milked those two, look to your taxable account for flexibility. Keep in mind that you can always pull your money out without penalties like in retirement accounts, but watch out for capital gains taxes! It's a balancing act, so make sure you adjust based on your financial goals and needsâ€”no one size fits all here! Consider chatting with a financial guru for personalized advice; after all, who doesnâ€™t love a little pro insight?
