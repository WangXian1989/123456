(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to at least get the full match, as this is essentially free money. If your 401(k) offers a good range of investment options and low fees, consider maximizing contributions up to the annual limit.

2. **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) for additional tax advantages. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've contributed to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals but donâ€™t have the same tax benefits as 401(k)s or IRAs.

It's essential to periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your income, expenses, and financial goals.

1. **401(k):** If youâ€™ve got a 401(k) match, you better slam at least enough in there to snag that free money! Itâ€™s like throwing a party and the employer's footing the bill for a few drinks, donâ€™t miss out! Once you've maxed that out to get the match, go as far as you feel good toward the annual limit. 

2. **IRA:** Next up, itâ€™s IRA time! If youâ€™re eyeing a Roth IRA, you're on the right train for tax-free withdrawals down the road. Itâ€™s like hiding treasure over time. Toss in as much as you can after your 401(k) actionâ€”you wonâ€™t regret it!

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Finally, the taxable account is your playground! You can invest in whatever you like here, but remember, Uncle Samâ€™s waiting to take a bite out of your gains. This is where you put in any leftover cash once you've played the tax-advantaged game.

And remember, keep an eye on that distribution dance! Adjust as life throws curveballs your wayâ€”finances arenâ€™t a â€˜set it and forget itâ€™ kinda deal!
