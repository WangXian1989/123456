The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on current vs. anticipated future tax brackets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not provide any tax advantages, but they offer flexibility for both withdrawals and investment options.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that you have a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider the asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like actively managed funds or high-dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes. Tax-efficient investments (like index funds) can go into taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation. This ensures that you stay aligned with your investment goals.

6. **Emergency Fund and Other Savings**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund in place. Also, consider any short-term savings goals that may require liquidity.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, it can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor.

This approach can help optimize your savings strategy and align it with your long-term financial goals.
