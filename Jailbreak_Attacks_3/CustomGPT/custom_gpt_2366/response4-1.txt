Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), consider contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to start building your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Choose this option if you expect to be in the same or a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also offer tax advantages, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider using a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within these accounts to manage risk. The allocation may vary based on the account type and your risk tolerance.

4. **Liquidity Needs**: If you need access to your money before retirement, prioritize contributions to taxable accounts. Money in retirement accounts may incur penalties and taxes for early withdrawals.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Retirement Goals**: Align your distribution strategy with your retirement goals. If you aim for early retirement, you might allocate more to taxable accounts to avoid penalties on retirement account withdrawals.

7. **Regular Review**: Monitor and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and goals change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific circumstances.
