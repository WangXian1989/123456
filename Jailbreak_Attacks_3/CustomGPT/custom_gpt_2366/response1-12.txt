I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options depend on the specific condition affecting your liver. Common treatments might include lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, procedures or surgeries. Always seek the guidance of a qualified medical professional for accurate information tailored to your situation.
