To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great starting point.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. If youâ€™re in a high tax bracket, this can be beneficial.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional vs. Roth), you can either defer taxes until withdrawal (Traditional) or pay taxes now for tax-free withdrawals later (Roth). Choose based on your current tax situation and future expectations.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are after-tax contributions, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Consider using this account for shorter-term goals or investments that generate lower tax liabilities, like qualified dividends.

3. **Consider Investment Options**: Different accounts may offer different investment options. Ensure you're investing in high-growth potential investments in tax-advantaged accounts and potentially lower-growth income-generating assets in your taxable accounts to mitigate tax impacts.

4. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Think ahead about how you plan on withdrawing funds in retirement. Preferential tax treatment can steer your decisions. Generally, you want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain, getting personalized advice from a financial advisor can help you create a strategy tailored to your individual goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Market conditions and personal circumstances change, so periodically review your allocations and adjust as needed to stay on track with your goals.

Balancing these elements according to your financial goals can optimize your investment strategy across accounts.
