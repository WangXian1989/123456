Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate short-term income or if you anticipate needing access to your funds before retirement. Investments in these accounts can be strategically managed to minimize taxes.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: You won't pay taxes on contributions until withdrawal, which is beneficial for current tax savings.
   - **Tax-Free Growth (Roth IRA)**: Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investment values change, periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances can greatly affect the best strategy; professional advice can tailor a plan suited to your needs.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to your investments while considering both growth and tax efficiency.
