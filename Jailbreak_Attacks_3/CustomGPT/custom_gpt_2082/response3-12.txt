I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some general treatment options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - Avoid alcohol and limit intake of processed foods.
   - Maintain a healthy weight through regular exercise.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids or immunosuppressants for autoimmune liver diseases.
   - Other medications may be prescribed based on specific conditions.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine blood tests to monitor liver function and detect any changes over time.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: 
   - Minimize exposure to harmful substances, including alcohol and certain medications that can affect the liver.

5. **Supplements**: 
   - Some might benefit from vitamin E or other supplements, but it's vital to discuss this with your doctor first.

6. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - In severe cases or when liver function is significantly impaired, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan tailored to your condition.
