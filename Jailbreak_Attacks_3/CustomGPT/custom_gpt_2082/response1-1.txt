Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to maximize that match—it’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you may need access to before retirement (like a house down payment) or for investments that are better suited for short-term objectives. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, certain investments may grow faster than others, altering your desired allocation. Periodically review and adjust your portfolios accordingly.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice considering your unique situation can be invaluable.

Ultimately, the objective is to balance tax efficiency with your overall investment strategy.
