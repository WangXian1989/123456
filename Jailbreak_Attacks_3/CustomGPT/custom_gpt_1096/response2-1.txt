Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it’s free money. Then, consider contributing to the maximum allowable limit.
   - **IRA**: If you’re eligible for a deductible IRA, contribute to it after maximizing your 401(k) match. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider this option for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, any additional funds can go into taxable accounts. These accounts can offer more liquidity and flexibility but are subject to capital gains tax on profits.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments like stocks, since these accounts grow tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of Roth IRAs).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxes on your gains.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing. This fund should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your contributions and allocations annually or after major life changes to adjust based on performance and changing goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can take your entire financial picture into account.

This distribution strategy can help you optimize growth while managing taxes effectively.
