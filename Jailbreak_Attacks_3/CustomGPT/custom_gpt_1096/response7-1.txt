The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions Based on Tax Benefits**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize this first. Contribute enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Max out your IRA contributions next. Depending on whether it's a Roth or traditional IRA, this can be beneficial for tax-free growth (Roth) or tax deferral (traditional).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider these last for retirement savings. However, they can be great for shorter-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you’re in a higher tax bracket now, consider traditional accounts (like a 401(k) and traditional IRA) to reduce taxable income. If you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, Roth accounts may be preferable.

### 3. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - Understand the rules about withdrawals from each type of account. Taxable accounts offer flexibility, while retirement accounts have penalties if accessed before age 59½.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes. More conservative investments (like bonds) can go in taxable accounts since they’re taxed at capital gains rates.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Review your distribution strategy annually. As your income, expenses, and financial goals change, your strategy should adapt accordingly.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 50% of contributions (to get the match)
- **IRA:** 30% of contributions (maximize tax advantages)
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20% of contributions (flexibility for short-term needs)
