To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Utilize tax benefits. A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, whereas a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions.

### 2. **Assessment of Goals and Timeline**
   - **Long-term Growth:** Prioritize retirement accounts for higher growth since they benefit from compounding.
   - **Short-term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k):** Focus on growth-oriented investments since funds are typically locked until retirement. Consider diversified mutual funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA:** Depending on your current tax bracket, decide between Traditional or Roth, then select investments that align with your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains tax impacts.

### 4. **Balancing Act**
   - Regularly reassess and adjust contributions based on performance and changing financial goals.
   - Monitor tax implications as income and taxes evolve, optimizing where you're putting your money.

### General Guidelines
- Max out tax-advantaged accounts before contributing to taxable accounts.
- Consider your overall tax situation and investment horizon when deciding on how much to allocate to each account. 

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights based on your entire financial picture.
