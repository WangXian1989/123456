Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the match, consider maxing out your IRA. Traditional IRAs give you tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.

3. **Prioritize Taxable Accounts Last**: If you reach the contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA, consider funding your taxable accounts. This allows flexibility in withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diversified asset allocation across all accounts. Stocks, bonds, and other investments can be balanced based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place the most tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and any changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, working with a financial professional can be beneficial.

By carefully planning your contributions and considering tax implications, you can optimize your investment growth over time.
