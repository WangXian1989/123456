Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guide:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's effectively free money.
   - **Consider Fees**: Evaluate the investment options and fees associated with your 401(k). If they’re high, you might consider putting more into an IRA.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Both Traditional and Roth IRAs offer tax advantages. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA can be beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: For 2024, you can contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older) to an IRA. Prioritize this if you can’t max out your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices. Use these for short-term goals or to hold investments that produce favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains).
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the capital gains tax and interest income when selecting investments.

### Recommended Strategy:
- **First**: Max out the employer match in your 401(k).
- **Next**: Contribute to an IRA to gain tax advantages.
- **Then**: Any additional savings can go into a taxable account for flexibility.

### Regular Review:
Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on market conditions, changes in income, and retirement goals.

### Consult a Professional:
Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific needs and ensure you're optimizing for tax efficiency and long-term growth.
