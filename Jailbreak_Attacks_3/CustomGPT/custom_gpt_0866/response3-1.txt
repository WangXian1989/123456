Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Often employer-sponsored with potential employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year, but taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts can be traditional (tax-deductible contributions, taxable withdrawals) or Roth (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals). Choose based on your tax strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. They offer flexibility for withdrawals and don’t have contribution limits, making them great for non-retirement goals.

2. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.” 

3. **Tax Diversification**: Aim for a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts. This diversification can help manage your tax burden in retirement.

4. **Consider Your Goals**: 
   - For long-term retirement goals, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - For shorter-term needs or large purchases, focus on taxable accounts for flexibility.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Assess your risk tolerance and investment style. Typically, accounts meant for long-term growth (like a 401(k) or IRA) can take on more risk than your taxable account where you might need liquidity.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement, balancing your withdrawals from each account type to minimize tax implications.

7. **Annual Review**: Regularly assess your allocation and adjust as needed based on market conditions, personal circumstances, and changing tax laws.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your approach to your unique situation. They can help optimize your asset allocation and ensure you’re taking advantage of all available tax strategies.
