Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies that may help:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum if possible for tax benefits.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income eligibility.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses in a liquid account.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals. Taxable accounts may be more suitable for assets that are expected to produce high returns or dividends.

5. **Retirement Time Horizon**:
   - If retirement is far off, you may prefer more aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRA, while maintaining a balanced approach in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Review and adjust your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your evolving goals and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice that considers your specific situation and goals.
