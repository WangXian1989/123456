To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Efficient Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Use for pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income. This is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions with tax-free growth). If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can be advantageous for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in this account for short-term needs or if you expect to need access to funds before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to allow for tax-free or deferred growth.
   - Keep bonds or other income-generating investments in taxable accounts if you hold them for the long term since they may be taxed at a lower capital gains rate.

4. **Review Regularly**: Assess your investment strategy periodically. Adjust based on changes in income, investment performance, and financial goals.

5. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

This approach aims to utilize the tax advantages of each account type while optimizing your overall investment strategy.
