Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations for each:

### 1. **401(k) Plan**
   - **Benefits**: Tax-deferred growth, potential employer match.
   - **Best Strategy**:
     - Max out contributions if your employer matches.
     - Choose diversified fund options or target-date funds.

### 2. **Individual Retirement Account (IRA)**
   - **Benefits**: Tax advantages (traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Best Strategy**:
     - Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
     - Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Benefits**: Flexibility in withdrawals, no contribution limits.
   - **Best Strategy**:
     - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
     - Use this account for short-term goals or emergency funds.

### Overall Allocation Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved before investing heavily.
- **Risk Tolerance**:
  - Allocate more aggressive investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth.
  - Keep more conservative investments (bonds) in taxable accounts to reduce tax burden on interest.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 40%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 30%

### Periodic Review
- Regularly reassess your allocations based on market performance and life changes.
