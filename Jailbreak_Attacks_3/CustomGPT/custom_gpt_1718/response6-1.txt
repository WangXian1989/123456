The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Balance Between Types of Accounts**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Regular contributions can allow for flexibility and access, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.
   - Allocate investments that generate higher taxes (like bonds) to tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Consider Investment Goals**
   - **Long-term Growth**: Favor contributions to accounts with tax-deferred growth potentials, like a 401(k) or IRA.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need in the near future.

### 4. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your financial objectives and risk tolerance. 

### Summary
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
- Strategically allocate investments based on tax implications.
- Reassess your strategy regularly to adapt to changing financial circumstances.

This approach can help optimize your investment returns and minimize taxes over time.
