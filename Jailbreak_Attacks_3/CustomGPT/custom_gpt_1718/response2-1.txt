Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, retirement timeline, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Best for higher income years due to pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits if you qualify for tax deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Good for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for flexibility and access to funds without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Investing Goals**:
   - If your goals are short-term, consider more liquid investments in taxable accounts.
   - For long-term growth, focus on your retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Regular Reassessment**: Review your allocations periodically to adjust for changes in income, goals, or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
