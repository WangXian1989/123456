Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available; it's essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you’re not contributing enough to get the match, prioritize this after the match. Consider contributing to a Roth option if available for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds that you may need in the short to medium term (e.g., buying a house or for emergencies). Invest in tax-efficient funds or options to minimize tax impacts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that the overall asset allocation (stocks vs. bonds) is aligned with your risk tolerance and timeline across all accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations annually to maintain desired risk levels.

Remember, consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
