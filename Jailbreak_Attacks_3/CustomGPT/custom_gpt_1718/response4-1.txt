Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Debt Repayment**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that off before investing heavily.

3. **Contribute to Roth IRA/Traditional IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.

4. **Max Out 401(k)**: If you still have funds available, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, any extra savings can go into taxable accounts. These are more flexible and provide easier access to funds but are subject to capital gains taxes.

6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Evaluate how your contributions will affect your current and future tax brackets. Diversifying between taxable and tax-advantaged accounts can provide tax flexibility in retirement.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

Always consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
