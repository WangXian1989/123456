Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Consider maxing out if you can.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute up to the maximum allowed. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for short-term goals or if you might need access to funds before retirement. They’re subject to capital gains taxes, so focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds).

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts align with your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Typically, retirement accounts can be more aggressive since they have a longer time horizon.

4. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - Review your asset allocation at least annually or after significant life changes. Adjust contributions as your income and financial situation evolve.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailoring your strategy to your unique situation can provide better results. Consider professional advice for personalized guidance.

Make sure to stay informed about any regulatory changes that may affect your contributions or tax implications.
