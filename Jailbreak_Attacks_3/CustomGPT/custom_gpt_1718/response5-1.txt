Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match; this is essentially “free” money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income during your working years. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize a Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. Use these for funds you might need before retirement or for goals outside retirement.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you’re in a lower tax bracket now, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. If you expect your income to rise, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) might be more beneficial initially.

### 4. **Diversification of Investments:**
   - Invest in a mix of assets suited to your risk tolerance across all accounts. Balance growth (stocks) with stability (bonds) according to your time horizon.

### 5. **Account-Specific Strategies:**
   - **High-growth assets** can go in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to delay taxes on gains.
   - **Income-producing investments** may be better suited for taxable accounts to avoid higher taxes on ordinary income.

### 6. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Regularly assess and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
