Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income now. Good for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest after-tax money here. Suitable for goals with shorter time frames or for investment flexibility.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

4. **Regular Contributions**: Consistently contribute to all accounts, prioritizing those that offer tax benefits, while maintaining ample liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and retirement goals, adjusting contributions based on performance and changing circumstances.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
