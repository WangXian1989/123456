To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits:**
   - Stay within the contribution limits for each account type. As of 2023, 401(k) contributions can typically go up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), while IRAs limit contributions to $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and over).

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets, adjusting the breakdown according to the accountâ€™s tax treatment.

4. **Tax-Efficiency:**
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds and real estate) in tax-advantaged accounts, as they generate interest or dividends that would be taxed at a higher rate in a taxable account.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to benefit from favorable capital gains tax rates.

5. **Consider Withdrawals and Future Plans:**
   - Think about when you might need to access funds. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility without penalties. Conversely, withdrawals from IRAs and 401(k)s before retirement age can incur penalties and taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and adapt to any changes in your financial goals or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient strategy for distributing your money across your financial accounts.
