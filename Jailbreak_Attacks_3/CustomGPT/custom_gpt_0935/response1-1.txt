Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Matching**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Focus here for long-term growth.

### 2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**
   - **Tax Considerations**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. For a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Stay aware of annual contribution limits. Maximize if possible.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow for easier access to funds without penalties, making them good for short- to mid-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **General Strategies**
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to reduce risk.
- **Rebalance**: Regularly reassess your allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and market conditions.
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain separate liquid savings for emergencies before maximizing retirement contributions.

### **Next Steps**
It’s also wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances. They can help craft a strategy that balances growth potential with risk management and tax efficiency.
