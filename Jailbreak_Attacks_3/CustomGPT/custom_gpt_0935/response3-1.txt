Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on the money you invest until withdrawal. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account:
     - 401(k): $22,500 (with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're 50 or older for 2024).
     - IRA: $6,500 (with a $1,000 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older).

4. **Diversifying Investments**:
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments that are normally taxed at higher rates, like bonds or actively managed funds.
   - Taxable accounts can hold investments with lower tax impacts, such as index funds or ETFs.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a separate savings account before aggressively investing. Generally, 3-6 months of living expenses is recommended.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement goals. 

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Personal circumstances vary, so consider getting professional advice tailored to your financial situation.

Following this framework can help you construct a balanced approach to your investments across these accounts.
