Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions upfront.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA contribution, consider increasing your 401(k) contributions. This allows for pre-tax growth, reducing your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. They provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be useful for mid-term goals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering the different tax treatments. For instance, holding higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts can be a strategic approach.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.

This strategy aims to optimize tax efficiency and align your investments with your financial goals.
