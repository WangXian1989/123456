To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### **1. Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts provide tax benefits, either deferring taxes or allowing for tax-free growth.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely:** Save investments in taxable accounts for assets that generate favorable long-term capital gains or qualified dividends.

### **2. Diversification:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.
   - **Balance Risk:** Allocate more volatile assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to optimize for risk and tax implications.

### **3. Contribution Strategy:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider the type (traditional vs. Roth) and your current tax bracket when deciding your IRA contributions.

### **4. Review and Rebalance:**
   - **Regular Reviews:** Periodically assess your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired level of risk and return.

### **5. Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - **Plan for Retirement Withdrawals:** Understand the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type in retirement (e.g., required minimum distributions from 401(k) and traditional IRA).

### **Conclusion:**
Crafting a tailored distribution plan requires an understanding of your financial situation and goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique circumstances.
