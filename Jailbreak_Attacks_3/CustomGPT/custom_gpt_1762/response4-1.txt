To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - Focus on high-growth investments since withdrawals are typically for retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now, but you'll owe taxes on withdrawals later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for savings goals outside of retirement or for investing in stocks that generate long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - Assess your tax situation and retirement goals.
   - Balance your investments based on risk tolerance, time horizon, and liquidity needs.
   - Regularly review and adjust contributions based on annual financial performance and changes in financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your individual situation.
