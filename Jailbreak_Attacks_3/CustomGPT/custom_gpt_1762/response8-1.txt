Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can help optimize your tax situation and retirement savings. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Pre-tax Accounts**: Contributions to your 401(k) and traditional IRA are tax-deductible, which can reduce your taxable income now.
   - **Post-tax Accounts**: Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes. It’s often best to place assets with higher expected returns (like stocks) in taxable accounts to benefit from long-term capital gains.

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - **Tax-inefficient Investments**: Consider placing high-dividend or bond funds in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) where you won’t face immediate taxes.
   - **Tax-efficient Investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments like index funds or ETFs that generate fewer taxable events.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement by considering tax implications; you might want to draw from your taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue to grow.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep your overall asset allocation consistent across all accounts, adjusting for tax implications and account types. 

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexity of tax regulations and individual situations, it can be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.

By balancing your contributions and maintaining a strategic investment mix, you can work toward optimizing your financial growth while minimizing taxes.
