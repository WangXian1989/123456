Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for its tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your match, continue contributing to your 401(k), especially if you have a strong lineup of investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility or when youâ€™ve maxed out retirement accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Keep a mix of assets across accounts to optimize for growth while managing risk.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Tax-efficient investments (like index funds) work well in taxable accounts, while bonds may be better in tax-advantaged accounts.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this to your situation!
