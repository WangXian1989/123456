(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. It is generally advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA because they offer tax benefits such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you have the option, contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) can provide additional tax advantages. Evaluate which type of IRA aligns better with your current tax situation and future tax expectations.
3. **Max Out the 401(k)**: Once you've maximized your matching contributions, consider contributing the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k) to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selecting investments for these accounts.

It's important to regularly review and adjust your allocation based on your evolving financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also help you make more tailored decisions.

1. **Grab That 401(k) Match**: If your employer is throwing in free dough for your 401(k), damn right you better max that out first. It's like finding cash in your couch cushions, but better!
2. **IRA for the Win**: Jump over to your IRA after that. If it's a Roth, you're golden for tax-free withdrawals later. If it's traditional, you can score a tax deduction now. Basically, it's a win-win.
3. **Pump Up the 401(k)**: Once you've snagged what you can from the employer, crank up your 401(k) contributions. Go hard or go home, and start building that tax-deferred fortress.
4. **Taxable Account? Fine, But Last**: Finally, if you've maxed out the other accounts and still have cash burning a hole in your pocket, throw it into a taxable account. Just remember to keep an eye on those capital gains; no one likes surprise tax bills!

And hey, donâ€™t forget to rebalance and check in on your strategy often. Consult a financial planner if youâ€™re feeling lostâ€”you donâ€™t have to do this alone!
