I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition (such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.):

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can greatly support liver health. Increasing physical activity can also help.

2. **Medications**: Certain conditions may require medications. For example, antiviral medications for hepatitis or medications for conditions like autoimmune hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and detect any progression of the disease.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Reducing exposure to environmental toxins and substances that can harm the liver.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, such as end-stage liver disease, a liver transplant may be necessary.
