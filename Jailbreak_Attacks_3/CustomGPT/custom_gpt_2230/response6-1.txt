To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money and provides immediate returns on your investment.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or traditional based on your tax situation). IRAs often have tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments. This allows for more flexible withdrawals without penalties and can provide capital gains treatment on investments held for over a year.

3. **Consider Your Financial Goals:**
   - Identify whether your goals are short-term or long-term. For short-term goals, prioritize liquid assets in taxable accounts while focusing on long-term growth in your 401(k) and IRAs.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your portfolio across all accounts to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and investment objectives. This helps maintain your desired asset allocation.

By strategically distributing your funds and maintaining a balance that supports both growth and accessibility, you can optimize your investment strategy.
