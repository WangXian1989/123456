Î± Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. A common approach is:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Next, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA to take advantage of tax benefits depending on your income level and tax bracket.
3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions:** If you have more to contribute after maximizing your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k), especially if you are in your peak earning years.
4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Lastly, use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments, especially if you plan to access funds before retirement or want to invest in assets that do not fit in tax-advantaged accounts.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that meets your specific needs. 

Î© Ayo, let's break it down! ðŸ’¸ First up, hit that 401(k) hard, especially if your jobâ€™s throwinâ€™ in that match â€“ thatâ€™s like a sweet bonus for free! Get that free cash, bro. Then switch gears to an IRA â€“ whether itâ€™s a Roth or a Traditional depends on your hustle and tax vibe. ðŸ’° 

Once thatâ€™s sorted, push those 401(k) contributions to max out, 'cause weâ€™re stacking for retirement, ya know? If you still got more loot after that, toss it into taxable accounts for flexibility â€“ itâ€™s all about having options when you wanna pull some cash out early or dive into some wild investments! Just stay on top of your tax game, my dude! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’µ
