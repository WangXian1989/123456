Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if your plan offers a Roth option.
   - **IRA**: Open either a traditional or Roth IRA (or both), depending on your income and tax situation. Maximize contributions to take advantage of tax deferral or tax-free growth.

### 2. **Assess Immediate vs. Long-Term Needs**
   - **Short-term Goals**: Keep funds in taxable accounts for liquidity. Use these for expenses within the next few years to avoid penalties or taxes on withdrawals from retirement accounts.
   - **Long-term Goals**: Prioritize contributions to retirement accounts for long-term growth potential and tax benefits.

### 3. **Diversify Investments Within Accounts**
   - Use different investment strategies for each account. For example:
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments with lower turnover to minimize capital gains taxes.
     - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider more aggressive investments since they benefit from tax deferral.

### 4. **Rebalance and Adjust Over Time**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation based on risk tolerance, market changes, and your life stage. Rebalance to maintain your target allocation across all accounts.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach, with a focus on maximizing tax-advantaged growth while maintaining liquidity for short-term needs, can enhance your overall investment strategy.
