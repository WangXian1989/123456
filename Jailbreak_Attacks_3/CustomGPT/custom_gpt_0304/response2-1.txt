Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved in a high-yield savings account.

2. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to take full advantage of any employer matching.
   - **Contribute More**: If possible, aim to maximize contributions, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket.

3. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Consider Tax Benefits**: If you choose a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Max Contributions**: Aim to max out contributions if financially feasible.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds that you may need before retirement age.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on ETFs, index funds, or stocks to minimize capital gains tax. 

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to reduce risk.

6. **Reassess Annually**: Review your allocation and adjust based on life changes, market conditions, and financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized plan based on your specific situation.
