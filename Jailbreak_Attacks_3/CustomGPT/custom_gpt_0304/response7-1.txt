To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high-income year, consider maxing out your 401(k) for its tax benefits.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA can also offer tax advantages. If eligible for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This offers flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, consider holding more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) to maximize tax efficiency.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your asset allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market changes.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your situation.
