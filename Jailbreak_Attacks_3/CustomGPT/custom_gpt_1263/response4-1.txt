Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** Prioritize contributions to fully take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **High Contribution Limits:** Maximize contributions if possible, especially if your income is significant.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Tax Advantages:** Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions on contributions.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits and eligibility based on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Use these for short-term goals or if you might need access to funds before retirement age.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Step 1:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **Step 2:** Max out an IRA if eligible, focusing on a Roth IRA if you anticipate higher taxes in retirement.
- **Step 3:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding a taxable account for flexibility.

### Final Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings for emergencies before heavily investing.
- **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts to manage risk.
