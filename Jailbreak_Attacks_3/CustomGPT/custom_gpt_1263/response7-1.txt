Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first, as it's essentially free money.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.
   - **401(k)**: If you haven't maxed out your 401(k), consider increasing contributions if you still have room.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in these for short-term goals or after reaching contribution limits for tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes and consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds).

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - **Liquidity**: Before aggressive investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a high-yield savings account.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline when selecting assets.

### 6. **Review and Adjust**
   - Periodically review your allocation based on life changes (like marriage, children, or career changes) and market conditions.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 10-15% (max if getting employer match)
- **IRA**: Up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) per year
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds after maxing other accounts

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
