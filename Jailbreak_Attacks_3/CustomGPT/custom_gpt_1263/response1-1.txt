Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - **Roth IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA:** If you want potential tax deductions now, contribute to a traditional IRA. 

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, consider a taxable account for flexibility and access to funds without penalties before retirement age.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like ETFs) to minimize tax implications.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - 401(k) and IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - Long-term capital gains rates for taxable accounts can be lower.

### 5. **Invest Based on Time Horizon:**
   - Invest more aggressively in accounts designed for long-term growth (like 401(k) and IRAs), while being conservative in taxable accounts to manage taxes.

### 6. **Regular Reassessment:**
   - Review your asset allocation and contributions regularly to adapt to changes in life circumstances or financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of salary until match is maxed.
- **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** Max out contributions ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Account:** Invest remaining funds after retirement accounts.

### Final Thoughts:
Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your specific situation.
