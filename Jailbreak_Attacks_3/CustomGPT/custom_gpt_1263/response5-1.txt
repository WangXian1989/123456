Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here’s a breakdown of how to approach this:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored with tax-deferred growth. Often has employer matching.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Offers tax advantages, but has contribution limits. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible access, but subject to capital gains tax on profits.

### 2. **Calculate Your Contribution Limits:**
   - Max out your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing to an IRA if you meet income limits.

### 3. **Prioritize Based on Goals:**
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Long-Term Retirement Savings:** Focus on maxing out 401(k) and IRA contributions as these accounts have tax advantages.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. This can include stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Allocate more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) to taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 6. **Review Regularly:**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and personal financial changes.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out employer match, contribute up to the limit.
- **IRA:** Contribute up to the limit, prioritizing Roth if eligible.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for additional savings and investment opportunities.

This balanced approach helps build a solid financial foundation for retirement while minimizing tax liabilities. It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to align this strategy with your specific circumstances.
