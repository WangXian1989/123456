Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions, tax-deferred growth, potential employer match. Best for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA:** Tax-deferred (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA) depending on the type. Good for retirement savings with more investment options than a 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Funds are taxed yearly on capital gains and dividends. More flexible for withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's free money).
   - **IRA:** Maximize contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next, especially for tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Contribute to taxable accounts after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Determine Investment Strategy:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Assess your comfort with market fluctuations. Higher risk may lead to higher rewards over time.
   - **Time Horizon:** Longer investment horizons can focus on growth investments, while shorter horizons may necessitate more conservative choices.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Place Investments Wisely:** Put higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes. Use taxable accounts for lower-growth or income-generating investments (like bonds), as they're taxed at lower rates.

### 5. **Regular Reviews:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in income, financial goals, or tax law changes.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max contributions up to the employer match, then aim for the annual limit.
- **IRA:** Maximize contributions separately for Traditional or Roth IRAs.
- **Taxable Account:** Allocate remaining savings for additional investments, focusing on diversification and liquidity.

### Summary:
A well-rounded strategy typically involves maximizing your 401(k) contributions first (up to the employer match), then contributing to an IRA, and finally utilizing taxable accounts. Adjust based on personal circumstances, ensuring that your overall asset allocation aligns with your long-term financial goals.
