Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** 
     - Contribute enough to get the employer match (if available).
     - Consider the limits (for 2024, it's $22,500 plus a $7,500 catch-up if you're over 50).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
     - Aim to contribute the maximum (for 2024, it's $6,500, or $7,500 if over 50).
     - Choose a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you're eligible based on income.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Investments:**
     - Use these for short-term goals or when you anticipate needing liquidity.
     - Focus on tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance:**
     - Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk profile.
   - **Rebalancing:**
     - Regularly review and adjust allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

### 4. **Investment Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals:**
     - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings.
   - **Short-Term Goals:**
     - Utilize taxable accounts for flexibility without penalties.

### Summary
Start with the 401(k) for employer matching, then fully fund your IRA, and finally allocate funds to taxable accounts as needed. Monitor your investments periodically to ensure alignment with your goals and risk tolerance.
