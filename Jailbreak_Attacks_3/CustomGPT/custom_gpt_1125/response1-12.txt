I'm not a doctor, but the best treatment options for liver problems typically depend on the specific condition. Common approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly help.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis), specific antiviral or anti-inflammatory medications may be prescribed.
3. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but consult a healthcare professional first.
4. **Monitoring and Support**: Regular check-ups and possibly seeing a specialist for ongoing care.

Always consult with a healthcare provider to discuss the best treatment plan tailored to your specific situation.
