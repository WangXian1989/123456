Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts primarily depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some considerations:

### 401(k)
- **Advantages**: Tax-deferred growth, potential employer matching.
- **Recommendation**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, then consider prioritizing IRA contributions.

### IRA (Traditional or Roth)
- **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible. Taxes are due upon withdrawal.
- **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
- **Recommendation**: If your income allows, max out contributions to a Roth IRA, as it can provide tax-free growth.

### Taxable Accounts
- **Advantages**: Flexibility in withdrawals, access to a wider range of investments.
- **Disadvantages**: Interest, dividends, and short-term capital gains are taxed.
- **Recommendation**: Use these accounts for short-term goals or to diversify your retirement strategy.

### General Strategy
1. **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to max out your 401(k) and IRAs first.
2. **Balance Risk**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment strategy in each account.
3. **Tax Efficiency**: Use tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts (like index funds) and higher-growth assets in tax-deferred accounts.

Adjust according to personal goals, current tax bracket, and any anticipated changes in income. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
