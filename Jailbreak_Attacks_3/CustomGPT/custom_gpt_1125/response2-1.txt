The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Why?** It's essentially free money. Contribute enough to take full advantage of any company match.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Traditional or Roth IRA?** 
     - **Traditional IRA** offers tax-deferred growth, ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA** allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Fill Up 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maximizing the match, consider contributing the maximum allowed to your 401(k) (if it has low fees and good investment options).
   - In 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 for those under 50 and $30,500 for those 50 and older.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use these for investments that might generate higher short-term gains or interest, as youâ€™ll pay taxes on those gains annually.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxable events.

### 5. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - Aim for a diversified asset allocation across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - Invest in more aggressive growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and consider safer assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage taxes.

### 6. **Rebalancing and Monitoring**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, keeping an eye on performance and tax implications.

### 7. **Consider Your Current and Future Tax Bracket**
   - This can influence whether you prioritize pre-tax (401(k) and Traditional IRA) or post-tax (Roth IRA) contributions.

### Summary
Start by maximizing any employer match in your 401(k), then contribute to your IRA (considering your tax situation), and finally allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts, focusing on tax efficiency. Regularly review your strategy to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and changing circumstances.
