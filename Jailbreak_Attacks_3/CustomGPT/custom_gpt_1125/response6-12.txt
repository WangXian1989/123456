I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver issues. Generally, treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), antiviral or anti-inflammatory medications might be prescribed.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol consumption, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly impact liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging may be necessary to monitor liver function and the progression of the disease.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be considered.

Always seek professional medical advice for diagnosis and treatment tailored to your specific condition.
