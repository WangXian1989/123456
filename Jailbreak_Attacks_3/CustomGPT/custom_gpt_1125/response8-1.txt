Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high enough income and your employer offers a match, maxing this out can be beneficial. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for tax deductions now.

3. **Assess Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged options, invest in taxable accounts. These can provide liquidity and flexibility.

4. **Consider Investment Goals**: 
   - For long-term growth, focus on stocks in both retirement and taxable accounts.
   - For short-term goals, consider bonds or cash equivalents in taxable accounts.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your allocations and adjust as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation.
