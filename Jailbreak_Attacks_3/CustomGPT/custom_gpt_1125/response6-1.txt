To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Also tax-deferred, with potential for tax-free growth if using a Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages but allows for liquidity and easy access.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **Prioritize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer matching funds.
   - **Max Out IRA**: If eligible, contribute the maximum to your IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Hold income-generating investments (like bonds) in your 401(k) and IRA to defer taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Keep long-term investments (like stocks) here to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess and Rebalance**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investments for growth while minimizing tax implications over the long term.
