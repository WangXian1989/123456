The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several personal factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After taking advantage of the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), whether traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility. IRAs typically offer more investment options and can provide tax advantages.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute, but withdrawals during retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, so qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You can invest in these accounts freely, but be aware that dividends and capital gains may be taxed in the year they are realized.

4. **Diversify Investments**: In each account type, consider a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. A well-diversified portfolio can help manage risk.

5. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon**: If you’re years away from retirement, you may want to take more risk (higher stock allocation). If you’re closer to retirement, consider shifting to a more conservative allocation.

6. **Periodic Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially if one account type grows significantly faster than others.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Always ensure you have adequate savings outside of retirement accounts for immediate expenses or emergencies, which should typically cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of individual circumstances, it may be beneficial to work with a financial advisor who can help tailor a plan specific to your needs and goals.

Remember that individual circumstances vary greatly, so consider these suggestions as starting points and adjust according to your situation.
