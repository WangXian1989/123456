The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Retirement Accounts**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you're eligible. The tax benefits of IRAs can be significant.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) (Traditional)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have tax advantages like retirement accounts, but they provide flexibility. Earnings and dividends are taxed in the year they are realized.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth investments, such as stocks or mutual funds, since you wonâ€™t pay taxes on the gains until retirement.
   - Consider keeping more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund Consideration**:
   - Ensure you maintain an adequate emergency fund outside of retirement accounts. This should cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Use Tax Loss Harvesting**:
   - In taxable accounts, consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting, which can offset capital gains taxes.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Review your investment allocations regularly and rebalance as needed based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor.

By considering these factors and aligning your distributions with your financial goals, you can create a balanced approach to your investment strategy.
