Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: First, consider maximizing your contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions up front, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes and income taxes on dividends.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Long-term Growth**: If youâ€™re investing for the long term, consider putting more into tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Keep funds for short-term goals or emergency savings in your taxable account for easier access without penalties.

4. **Allocation**: 
   - Diversify your investments across different accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. 
   - You might prioritize placing high-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts and keep more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and interest.

5. **Revisit Periodically**: Your financial situation changes over time, so review and adjust your allocations annually or as your circumstances evolve.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
