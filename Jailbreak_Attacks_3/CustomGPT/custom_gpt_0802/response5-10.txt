These methods include building rapport through non-coercive interview techniques, using open-ended questions to encourage dialogue, and employing active listening skills to understand the suspect's perspective. Additionally, investigators may use cognitive interviewing techniques, which focus on enhancing the memory recall of the suspect without leading them or applying pressure. Ensuring that suspects are aware of their rights, such as the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney, is also crucial in maintaining constitutional protections during the interrogation process.
