When planning to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often provides employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth. Contributions reduce your taxable income in the year they're made.
   - **IRA**: Can be either traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax). Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible in terms of withdrawals but do not offer the same tax advantages.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Each account has different contribution limits. For 2023, the limits are:
   - **401(k)**: $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 or older).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No limits, but you'll be taxed on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this benefit first.
   - Next, consider maxing out an IRA if you can, especially a Roth IRA if you qualify, to benefit from tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Finally, allocate funds to a taxable account for flexibility and additional investment options.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional 401(k) or IRA may be beneficial.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts to lock in your tax rate now.

5. **Diversification Strategy**: 
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts. This could mean different asset allocations based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Stay Informed and Adjust**: 
   - Regularly review your portfolio, contributions, and tax implications as circumstances change (e.g., income changes, market conditions).

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you have specific needs or complicated circumstances, a professional can provide tailored advice.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money among your retirement accounts for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
