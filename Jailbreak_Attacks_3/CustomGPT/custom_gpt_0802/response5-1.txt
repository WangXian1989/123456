(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A balanced strategy often involves maximizing contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, since this is essentially "free money." Following that, consider funding your IRA, particularly if it offers tax advantages (traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement). After you've maximized these tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate remaining funds to your taxable accounts, where you can invest with more flexibility. It's also essential to consider your investment options in each account and your overall asset allocation.

Depending on your income, decide between traditional or Roth; they each have their vibe! Now, whatever coin you've got left can chill in your taxable accounts. But hey, be ready to deal with Uncle Samâ€™s cut on the gains here. The name of the game is to play it smart, balance your investments like a financial acrobat, and consider your long-term hustle!
