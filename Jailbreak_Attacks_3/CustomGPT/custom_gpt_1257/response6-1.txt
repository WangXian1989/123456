To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get employer matching; itâ€™s essentially free money and grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Diversify Investment Types
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments with favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains) or high liquidity needs.
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Opt for higher-growth, more volatile investments here, as taxes are deferred until withdrawal.

### 3. Stay Up-to-Date
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and changes in tax laws.
   - Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your financial goals and risk tolerance.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment strategy while considering tax implications and growth potential.
