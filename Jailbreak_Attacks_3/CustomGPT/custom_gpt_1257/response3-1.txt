To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After securing the match, consider contributing the maximum allowed to your 401(k). This reduces your taxable income and benefits from tax-deferred growth.

3. **IRA Contributions**: After your 401(k), contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are likely to generate capital gains or are more liquid. Consider holding investments with lower tax implications, like index funds or municipal bonds.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Keep in mind your risk tolerance and investment goals. Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, ETFs) to manage risk.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking professional advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

This balanced approach can help optimize your retirement savings while managing tax implications.
