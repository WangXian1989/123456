I'm not a doctor, but for liver issues, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional who can provide personalized medical advice. Typically, treatment options may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in severe cases, surgery. Common recommendations include:

1. **Dietary Changes**: A balanced diet low in fat and sugar can help.
2. **Alcohol Abstinence**: Avoiding alcohol is often essential.
3. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, certain medications might be prescribed.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up appointments for blood tests to assess liver function.

Please seek medical advice for accurate diagnosis and treatment.
