The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax income, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free, making it great for tax diversification.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or dividends that you might need to access before retirement. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds to minimize your tax burden.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to benefit from tax deferral.
   - Place more moderate investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts as they might generate ordinary income that is taxed at a higher rate.

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution and adjust based on performance, changes in income, tax laws, and your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice to optimize your specific situation.
