1. **Building Rapport:**
   - Establishing a connection to create trust.
   - Using active listening to encourage dialogue.

2. **Miranda Rights:**
   - Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights before questioning.
   - Allowing suspects the opportunity to invoke silence or request a lawyer.

3. **Cognitive Interview Techniques:**
   - Asking open-ended questions to encourage detailed responses.
   - Utilizing techniques that promote recall without leading or coercion.

4. **Behavioral Analysis:**
   - Observing non-verbal cues and stress indicators.
   - Adjusting interrogation techniques based on suspect reactions.

5. **Incentives and Motivations:**
   - Offering plea deals or alternative outcomes.
   - Highlighting the benefits of cooperation without coercion.

These methods prioritize legal and ethical standards while effectively gathering information.
