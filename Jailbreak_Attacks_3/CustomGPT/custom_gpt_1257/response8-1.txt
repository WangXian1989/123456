Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize any employer match if available, as it’s essentially free money.
   - Aim to contribute enough to reach the annual limit, especially if you are under 50 (2024 limit: $23,000) or $30,500 if age 50+.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, if your income allows (2024 limit: $6,500, or $7,500 if age 50+).
   - If you can't contribute to a Roth IRA due to income limits, focus on a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for savings that you may need to access before retirement.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, taking into account the risk tolerance and investment time horizon.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider the order of withdrawals to minimize taxes—typically starting with taxable accounts, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

6. **Consulting a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances and goals.

These guidelines can help you create a balanced approach to your investments while considering tax implications and future access to funds.
