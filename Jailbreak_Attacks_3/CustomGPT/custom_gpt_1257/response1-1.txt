Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Max Out Employer Contributions**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is free money!

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high contribution limits, prioritize this, especially if your employer matches.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider maxing out an IRA after your 401(k) contributions, depending on whether you prefer immediate tax breaks (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that generate long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Consider using them for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account. Use stock-heavy options in accounts that benefit from tax advantages while keeping more stable investments in taxable accounts to manage taxes efficiently.

5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**: Revisit your strategy periodically to adjust for changes in tax laws, your income, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a plan to your specific needs.
