The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, investment timeline, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies to consider for each account type:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Benefit from tax-deferred growth, which makes 401(k)s excellent for long-term savings. Aim to maximize contributions if you're under 50 ($19,500 for 2021, or $26,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Investment Choices**: Consider the investment options available. Some plans may have higher fees or limited choices.

2. **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**: 
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider maximally funding it as withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductions upfront but are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2021, you can contribute $6,000 to an IRA ($7,000 if you're 50 or older). This is in addition to your 401(k) contributions.
   - **Diversification**: Use IRAs to diversify your investments, particularly if you feel your 401(k) is lacking in other investment options.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices. They're great for money that you may need access to before retirement age or for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be aware of the tax implications; dividends and capital gains could be taxed. You might want to hold investments with high growth potential (more suitable for tax-advantaged accounts) in IRAs and 401(k)s, while keeping bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates.

### Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with getting the employer match in your 401(k), then maximize your IRA contributions.
- **Assess Overall Allocation**: Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. You want a mix of stocks and bonds spread across all accounts.
- **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly monitor your investments and adjust as necessary based on life changes, market conditions, or new financial goals.

**Final Tip**: Consult with a certified financial planner or tax advisor to create a personalized strategy that fits your unique situation and long-term goals.
