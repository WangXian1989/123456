Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA can be advantageous.

2. **Balance Contributions**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This could provide flexibility in accessing funds without penalties before retirement.

3. **Investment Strategy Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a diversified mix of low-cost index funds or target-date funds aligned with your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Consider a broader range of investments, including stocks, bonds, and ETFs, to optimize growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more liquid investments; consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals based on your tax situation in retirement, withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k), and finally tax-free accounts like a Roth IRA.

5. **Continuous Review**:
   - Regularly assess your financial status and make adjustments based on changes in income, expenses, and tax laws.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation and goals.
