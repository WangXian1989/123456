Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income level and tax filing status, consider maximizing contributions to an IRA. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Money in a 401(k) and Traditional IRA is tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes upon withdrawal. Roth IRAs and taxable accounts allow for tax-free or capital gains tax on growth, respectively.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts may be beneficial.

3. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**:
   - Maintain a sufficient balance in your taxable accounts for liquidity, ensuring you can cover emergency expenses or short-term financial goals without penalty.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Determine your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Long-term holdings (e.g., stocks) might be suited for tax-advantaged accounts, whereas more liquid investments can be placed in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your portfolio is well-diversified across these accounts to manage overall risk.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice and strategies tailored to your specific circumstances, consulting a financial advisor is always a good idea.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will vary based on individual financial situations and goals.
