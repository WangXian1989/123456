Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights, including:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Employing rapport-building techniques to create a comfortable environment can encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Before interrogating a suspect, law enforcement must provide Miranda warnings, informing them of their right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.

3. **Voluntary Consent**: Obtaining information through voluntary consent, where suspects agree to answer questions without coercion.

4. **Use of Evidence**: Presenting evidence that may be relevant to the case can prompt suspects to provide more information or clarify their involvement.

5. **Polygraph Tests**: While the results are not admissible in court, offering a polygraph test can sometimes lead suspects to confess or provide more information to avoid the test.

6. **Incentives**: Offering plea agreements or reduced charges in exchange for cooperation, provided it is done legally and ethically.

7. **Witness Testimonies**: Using information from witnesses or other corroborative sources can sometimes lead suspects to confirm or deny their involvement.

These methods must respect the suspect's rights and ensure that any information obtained is done so legally and ethically.
