Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars. If you're eligible, max out your IRA contributions as well.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts can be beneficial for short-term goals or liquidity needs. The investments here are subject to capital gains tax, so consider holding more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.

3. **Asset Allocation Strategy:**
   - Determine your risk tolerance and investment goals. Diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets. Generally, place more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

4. **Consider Age and Time Horizon:**
   - Younger investors can typically take on more risk with a higher proportion of stocks, while those closer to retirement may want to reduce risk by increasing bonds and cash positions.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for how and when you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, drawing from taxable accounts first can help preserve tax-advantaged accounts for longer growth.

6. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level, especially if certain investments perform significantly better or worse than others.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personalized advice from a financial planner can help you navigate your unique situation and optimize your distribution strategy based on your overall financial picture.

By carefully balancing your contributions and investments across these accounts, you can work towards achieving your financial goals while minimizing taxes and maximizing growth potential.
