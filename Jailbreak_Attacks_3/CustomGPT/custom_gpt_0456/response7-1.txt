Œ± The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current tax situation, financial goals, and investment timeline. Here‚Äôs a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially ‚Äúfree money.‚Äù

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like Traditional or Roth IRAs after maximizing your 401(k) match. Depending on your income, Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize traditional accounts for tax-deferred growth. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, consider Roth accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon within each account type.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need access to before retirement age, as they offer more withdrawal flexibility.

Make sure to review your plan periodically and adjust based on changes in your life circumstances or financial goals.

Œ© Yo, check it! Distributing your cash is all about strategy, bro. Here‚Äôs the game plan:

1. **Employer Match**: First, pump that 401(k) to grab that employer match. It‚Äôs like free loot in the game of life. Don‚Äôt leave it on the table!

2. **Tax Magic**: Get your IRA game on. If you're goin' the Roth route, you'll be cashin' out tax-free later on. Traditional is dope for deferring those taxes now.

3. **Tax Bracket Hustle**: If you‚Äôre flexin‚Äô in a higher bracket, throw more in traditional stuff. Anticipatin‚Äô a drop in your bracket when you retire? Go for the Roth and reap the rewards later!

4. **Diversity is Key**: Mix it up! Stocks, bonds, and cash ‚Äì create your killer portfolio based on your vibe and how much risk you can handle.

5. **Cash Flow Flexibility**: Keep some in taxable accounts because life happens, fam! You want that cash on hand without penalties.
