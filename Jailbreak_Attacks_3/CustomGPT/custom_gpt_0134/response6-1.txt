Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but flexible access to funds.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs).
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Keep some funds in taxable accounts for easy access.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds) within each account to manage risk effectively.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any company match.
2. **IRA Contributions**: Max out your IRA contributions (Roth if eligible for tax-free growth).
3. **Fill Taxable Accounts**: After maxing the above, use taxable accounts for additional investments.

### Periodic Review
- Regularly assess your portfolio and rebalance as necessary to align with your investment goals and market changes.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
