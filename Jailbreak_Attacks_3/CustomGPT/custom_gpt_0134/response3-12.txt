Iâ€™m not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver issues often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and weight management can significantly help liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Abstaining from alcohol is crucial for liver recovery.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and liver function tests can help track your condition.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
