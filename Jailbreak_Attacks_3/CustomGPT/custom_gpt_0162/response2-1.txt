Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, retirement goals, and current income level. Here are some general strategies to consider for each account type:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits:** Take advantage of higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
   - **Targeted Investments:** Look for funds or options that align with your long-term goals. Consider a target-date fund if you prefer a hands-off approach.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Decide whether a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA is more suitable based on your current and anticipated future tax rates. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, a Roth might be better.
   - **Diversified Investments:** Ensure you have a well-diversified portfolio (stocks, bonds, etc.) that matches your risk tolerance.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Use this account for liquidity; maintain an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of expenses.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider tax-efficient funds or ETFs that minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Withdrawals and Tax Planning:** Be mindful of how withdrawals from taxable accounts can impact your tax situation. Long-term capital gains are typically taxed at a lower rate than regular income.

### Overall Strategy:
- **Diversification:** Ensure that your overall investment strategy is diversified across all accounts.
- **Rebalancing:** Regularly rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Long-Term Focus:** Stay focused on your long-term financial goals, and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations.
