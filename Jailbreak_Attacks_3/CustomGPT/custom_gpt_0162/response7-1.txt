(Œ±) When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to understand the benefits and tax implications of each type of account. A general strategy might include the following:

1. **Maximize Employer-Matched Contributions:** If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts:** After securing the match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.

3. **Tax Efficiency:** Taxable accounts should generally hold investments that generate lower capital gains and qualified dividends, while tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs can hold higher-growth investments that benefit from tax deferment.

4. **Consider Your Financial Goals:** If you have short-term goals, keep more in taxable accounts for liquidity, while retirement savings can go largely into tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your investments' performance and rebalance as necessary to ensure they align with your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your specific situation.
