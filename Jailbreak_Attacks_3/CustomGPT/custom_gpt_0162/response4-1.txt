When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy often depends on your specific financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing the maximum amount you can afford if you are close to retirement, especially if you're in a high tax bracket. Contributions reduce your taxable income now.

2. **IRA Accounts**: 
   - Traditional IRA contributions may also lower your taxable income. Consider this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket when you retire.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate significant capital gains or interest income, which won't benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - This can include stocks or mutual funds, which you might hold for the long-term to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: 
   - If you're investing for longer-term goals, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. 
   - For short-term goals, a taxable account may be more appropriate.

5. **Tax Diversification**: 
   - Having a mix of account types can provide tax flexibility in retirement. This means youâ€™re able to withdraw from accounts in a way that minimizes your tax burden.

6. **Periodic Reevaluation**: 
   - Regularly check your investment distribution and financial goals to ensure your approach remains aligned with your objectives, especially as tax laws or your personal situation changes.

Ultimately, it's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to develop a strategy that is tailored to your specific situation and goals.
