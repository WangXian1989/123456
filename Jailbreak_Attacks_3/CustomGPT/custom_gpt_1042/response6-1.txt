Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money) and consider maxing out contributions if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA (depending on your income and tax situation) to take advantage of tax benefits.

2. **Tax Diversification**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for flexible withdrawals and investments that may generate qualified dividends or capital gains, which can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Balance tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

3. **Investment Strategy and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, more aggressive investments can be made in accounts meant for long-term growth (like a 401(k) or IRA), while safer investments may be suited for taxable accounts if you are concerned about market volatility.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement to manage tax implications. Often, itâ€™s strategic to withdraw from taxable accounts first during the early years of retirement to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It can be beneficial to meet with a financial planner to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.

Always review your investment allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance as you progress through different life stages.
