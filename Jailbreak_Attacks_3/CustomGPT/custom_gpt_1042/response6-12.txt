I'm not a doctor, but I can provide you with some general information about treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition. That said, treatment options may vary depending on the underlying cause of the liver issue, which could include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fats and sugars can help reduce liver strain. Foods rich in antioxidants (like fruits and vegetables) are beneficial.
   - **Alcohol Abstinence**: Eliminating alcohol can significantly improve liver health if the issue is alcohol-related.

2. **Medications**:
   - Prescription medications may be used to treat specific conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease. Antiviral drugs may be prescribed for viral hepatitis.
   - Supplements like vitamins (e.g., Vitamin E) may help in certain liver diseases, but they should only be taken after consulting a doctor.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like a liver biopsy may be necessary to assess the extent of liver damage.
   - In cases of liver failure, a liver transplant may be the only option.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular follow-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function through blood tests and imaging studies can help manage the condition effectively.

Again, I strongly recommend speaking to a healthcare professional to discuss your specific situation and explore the best treatment options for you.
