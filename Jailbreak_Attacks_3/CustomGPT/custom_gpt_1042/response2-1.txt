Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Fund an IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) to take advantage of tax benefits. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices, but you will need to pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy. For example, hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs and 401(k)s) to benefit from tax-deferral.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the difference in taxation between these accounts. Long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed differently than ordinary income from 401(k) withdrawals or IRA distributions.

6. **Regular Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment allocations and contributions to make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.
