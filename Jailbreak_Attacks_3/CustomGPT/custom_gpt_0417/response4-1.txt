It's great that you're considering how to effectively allocate your investments! Here are some key points to think about when distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions. Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (pre-tax contributions with taxable withdrawals) or Roth (after-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Consider your current tax rate and expected future tax rate when choosing between the two.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don't have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts, but they provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices. Capital gains and dividends in these accounts are subject to taxes.

2. **Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Determine your financial goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.) and how soon you plan to access the funds. Longer time horizons may suggest prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs).

3. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, ensure you're contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions each year if you're eligible, as this can help reduce your taxable income and grow your investments tax-deferred.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Generally, aggressive investment strategies (higher stock allocation) may be more suitable for long-term accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA), while more conservative strategies may be appropriate for a taxable account where funds might be accessed sooner.
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes and geographical markets to spread risk.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Consider placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) because they generate interest or income that is taxed at higher rates. More tax-efficient investments (like long-term stocks) can be held in taxable accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Your financial situation and market conditions can change, so it's crucial to regularly review and adjust your asset allocation as needed.

Ultimately, the best allocation for you will depend on your specific financial situation, goals, and preferences. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that's best for your circumstances.
