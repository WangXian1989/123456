Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depend on several factors such as your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Employer-sponsored 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income in the year you contribute. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement (including earnings) are tax-free, provided you meet certain conditions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment income and capital gains are taxable in the year they are realized. This may influence how you want to allocate money here.

3. **Assess Your Retirement Timeline:**
   - If you're far from retirement, focus on maximizing growth potential, potentially favoring a mix of stocks in your taxable account while keeping more conservative investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - As retirement approaches, consider shifting to more conservative investments to reduce risk.

4. **Diversification:** Each account type should be diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

5. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a readily accessible account before heavily investing in these vehicles.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Given the personal nature of financial distribution, consulting with a financial advisor could provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.

Each individualâ€™s situation is unique, so consider these factors based on your goals and consult with a professional if needed. Would you like to dive deeper into any specific part of this?
