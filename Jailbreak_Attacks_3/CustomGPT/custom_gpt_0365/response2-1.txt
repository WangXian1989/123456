Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general strategy:

### 1. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid savings account first.

### 2. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match (if available), as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

### 3. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Considerations**: Choose a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Max Contributions**: Aim to max out your IRA contributions if possible.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Lower Taxes on Long-Term Gains**: Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **Suggested Distribution**
1. **401(k)**: Max out 401(k) contributions up to the employer match.
2. **IRA**: After matching, contribute to an IRA up to the max limit.
3. **Taxable Account**: Invest any additional savings here for flexibility.

### **Review Regularly**
- Assess your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
- It's wise to get personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.
