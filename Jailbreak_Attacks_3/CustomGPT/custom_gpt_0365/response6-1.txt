The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matching**
   - **401(k) First:** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Max out contributions to a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts:** If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later, consider a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) for tax-free withdrawals.

### 3. **Assess Timing and Withdrawals**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term goals or to access funds without penalties. They may offer more flexibility.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Maintain a balanced portfolio based on your risk tolerance across all accounts (stocks, bonds, etc.).

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - **Periodic Review:** Adjust your asset allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change.

### Conclusion
Prioritize contributions to ensure you take full advantage of employer matches and tax benefits, while maintaining a flexible approach with taxable accounts for liquidity. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies.
