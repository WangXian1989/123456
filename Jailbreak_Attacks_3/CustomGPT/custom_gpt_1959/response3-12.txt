I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for any liver health issues. They will be able to assess your specific condition and recommend appropriate treatment options. Generally, treatment for liver problems may include lifestyle changes such as diet modifications, medication to address underlying conditions, and in severe cases, surgery or liver transplant. Always seek advice from a qualified healthcare provider for accurate diagnosis and treatment.
