When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Max out employer-sponsored accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) and matches contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider tax implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k) in tax treatment. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, since contributions are made with after-tax dollars and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable accounts**: This is where you invest post-tax income, and you’ll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

3. **Diversify your investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk. 

4. **Balance growth and income**: In your tax-advantaged accounts, you might prioritize growth-focused investments since you won’t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal. In taxable accounts, consider income-generating investments so that you can manage tax liabilities more effectively.

5. **Review your investment horizon and risk tolerance**: The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative your allocation may need to be. 

6. **Adjust as needed**: Regularly review your allocation and make adjustments based on market conditions, changes in income, or life events.
