I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with liver problems. It's really important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options. They can provide the most appropriate recommendations based on your specific condition. In general, some common treatment options for liver issues may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in severe cases, procedures such as surgery or liver transplantation. Please seek medical guidance as soon as possible.
