Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several key factors, such as your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching; contributions are pre-tax, grow tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages; can be traditional (pre-tax contributions) or Roth (after-tax contributions) with specific income limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages; investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) for long-term investments that will grow tax-deferred.
   - Consider using taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement or for short-term goals.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - In your 401(k) and IRA, you might want a more aggressive investment strategy (e.g., stocks) to take advantage of long-term growth.
   - In taxable accounts, consider investment options that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing risk and growth potential. This includes using different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account.

6. **Adjust Contribution Goals**: Based on your retirement timeline—typically increasing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts as you get closer to retirement.

7. **Review Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your investments and contributions regularly based on changes in financial status, investment performance, and retirement goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that aligns with your specific financial goals and risk tolerance.

By following these steps, you can create a solid investment strategy that makes the most of your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
