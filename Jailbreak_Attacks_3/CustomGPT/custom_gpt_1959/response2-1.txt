Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Maximize your employer match if available. Contribute enough to receive the full matching contribution as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing the maximum allowed if you're in your highest earning years, as it provides tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, especially if you believe you'll be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, consider a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are more liquid or needed for short-term goals, as these can be accessed without penalties.
   - Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to take advantage of lower tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Balance high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize tax liabilities.
   - Place lower-growth investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as their returns are taxed at ordinary income rates.

5. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Individual circumstances vary; consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies based on your specific situation.

Always consider your overall investment strategy, time horizon, and future financial needs when making these decisions.
