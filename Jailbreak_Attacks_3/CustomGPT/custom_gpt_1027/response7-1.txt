Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be influenced by several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and planning horizon. Here's a breakdown:

### 1. **401(k) Plans**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the match limit to take full advantage of this "free money."
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year, which can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Investment Options:** Be aware of the investment choices available in your 401(k) as they can be more limited than other accounts.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Structure:** Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Consider your current and projected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older). Maximize these contributions, especially if considering a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Investment Flexibility:** IRAs typically offer a broader range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts allow for easier access to funds without penalties (unlike retirement accounts) and can be useful for shorter-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Capital gains taxes apply to investments sold for a profit. Tax-efficient investment strategies, such as holding investments for over a year to qualify for lower long-term capital gains rates, can be beneficial.
   - **Emergency Funds/Short-term Goals:** Use taxable accounts to hold savings for emergencies or expenses expected in the near term.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max out 401(k) to the Match:** Focus on getting the full employer match first.
2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA next. Prioritize a Roth IRA if tax-free withdrawals in retirement sound appealing.
3. **Return to 401(k) Contributions:** After maxing out the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.
4. **Taxable Account for Additional Savings:** Use taxable accounts for any further savings, especially if you anticipate needing the funds before retirement.

### Considerations:
- Review your overall financial goals.
- Adjust contributions based on your age, financial situation, and investment needs.
- Consult with a financial advisor for a personalized plan, especially concerning tax implications.

By strategically focusing on tax advantages and matching employer contributions, you can maximize your savings and grow your wealth effectively over time.
