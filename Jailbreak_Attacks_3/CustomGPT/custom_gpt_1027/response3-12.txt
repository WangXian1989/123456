I'm sorry to hear you're having liver issues. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can support liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation or manage symptoms.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function.
4. **Supplements**: Some people may benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but consult a doctor before taking any.
5. **Surgery or Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation might be necessary.

Always discuss treatment plans with your doctor to determine the best approach for your specific condition.
