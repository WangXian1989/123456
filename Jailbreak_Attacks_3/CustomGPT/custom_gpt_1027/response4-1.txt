Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general guideline to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Maximize contributions if you can, as they lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits and deadlines.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Contributions to taxable accounts are not restricted, giving you access to your money without penalties.
   - **Investment Choices**: You can invest in a broader range of assets, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments that are sold for a profit.

### Strategies for Distribution:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before committing excess funds to investments.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Assess your risk tolerance to determine asset allocation—bonds for conservative investors, stocks for aggressive strategies.
- **Time Horizon**: Longer time horizons may favor a higher allocation in stocks, while shorter time frames may require more bonds or cash equivalents.
- **Tax Diversification**: Consider the tax implications of withdrawals in retirement; having a mix allows for strategic withdrawals.

### Regular Review:
- Reassess your asset distribution annually or as your financial situation changes, ensuring it aligns with your retirement goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor these broad principles to your specific situation.
