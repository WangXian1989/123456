Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** Contribute to an IRA or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA can be more advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate low tax or tax-free growth, like index funds or ETFs. They can be advantageous for flexibility and liquidity.

3. **Balance Between Growth and Stability:**
   - Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance. Generally, you may want to hold higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

4. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Review your allocations annually or after major life events (like marriage or a new job), adjusting for changes in your goals or market conditions.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can offer tailored advice based on your specific circumstances and goals.

Always ensure your portfolio is diversified to mitigate risk across all accounts.
