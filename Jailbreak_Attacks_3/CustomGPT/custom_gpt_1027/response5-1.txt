(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. 

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. 

2. **IRA:** Maximize contributions to your IRA (Roth or traditional) if you qualify. It provides tax advantages that can help grow your retirement savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may need to be accessed before retirement or for financial goals that fall outside retirement, as they offer more liquidity. 

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific needs.

1. **401(k):** First, blast that employer match like itâ€™s the last donut at a meeting. Free money is a must! Go above the match if you can since itâ€™s pre-tax dollars that will compound over time.

2. **IRA:** Next, pump up your IRA contributions. Whether it's a traditional or a Roth, these accounts can really rock the tax advantages. You've gotta love tax-free growth!

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Lastly, sprinkle some cash into those taxable accounts. They give you flexibility, plus you can pick and choose investments that might be tax-efficient. Think of it as your financial freedom fund for unexpected adventures. 

And hey, consult a financial guru for the nitty-gritty tailored to your life; they can help you avoid rookie mistakes!
