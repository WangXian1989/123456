Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maxing out the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. As of 2023, the limits are:
     - **401(k):** $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50)
     - **IRA:** $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50)
   - Adjust your contributions accordingly to maximize tax benefits.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k):** Often offers a limited selection of investments. Choose wisely based on your risk tolerance and time frame.
   - **IRA & Taxable Accounts:** With broader investment options, you can diversify into stocks, bonds, or other assets. Consider keeping more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes on gains.

### 4. **Think About Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts can be efficient for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Make adjustments as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

### 6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Before heavily investing in these accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund in place (usually 3-6 months of expenses).

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you're unsure, a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that suits your specific circumstances.

Balancing these accounts wisely can help optimize your savings and investment growth in the long run.
