To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Contributions Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the employee contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). For IRAs, itâ€™s $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50).

2. **Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Taxes are due upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer potential tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts do not offer tax advantages, but they provide greater flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Investment Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your goals. Typically, retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) should focus on growth-oriented investments since they are long-term.

4. **Liquidity Needs**: Consider your need for liquidity. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for accessing funds, while retirement accounts impose penalties for early withdrawals.

5. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating funds to an IRA or taxable accounts.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes, regardless of the account type.

A common strategy might be to maximize your 401(k) contributions up to the employer match, then fund your IRA, and finally allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts.
