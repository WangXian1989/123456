I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options may include:

1. **Medications:** Depending on the condition, medications can help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral medications for hepatitis).

2. **Lifestyle Changes:** Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can all support liver health.

3. **Management of Underlying Conditions:** Treating related issues such as diabetes or high blood pressure may also benefit liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track the condition.

5. **Surgery:** In some cases, procedures or surgeries may be necessary for conditions like liver tumors or severe fatty liver disease.

Always consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your needs.
