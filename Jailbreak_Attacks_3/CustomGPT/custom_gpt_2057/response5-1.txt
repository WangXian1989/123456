To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer tax benefits. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Determine Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now, prefer the traditional 401(k) and IRA for tax-deferred growth. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth options instead for tax-free withdrawals.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure you have a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement goals. This could include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

5. **Use Taxable Accounts for Additional Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that don't fit neatly into the tax-advantaged arena, providing more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your investment strategy across all accounts to ensure it remains aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance. This includes rebalancing your portfolio as necessary.

Consult a financial advisor and tailor these strategies based on your unique financial situation and retirement objectives.
