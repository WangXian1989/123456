To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Determine Your Retirement Goals**: Assess your retirement age, lifestyle expectations, and how much income you'll need.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing your contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

3. **Assess Your Current Tax Bracket**: Contributions to a Traditional 401(k) and IRA can lower your taxable income, whereas a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth.

4. **Diversify Among Accounts**: Allocate funds based on investment choices available in each account, focusing on assets that fit your risk tolerance and timeline.

5. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**: Long-term investments may suit tax-advantaged accounts better, while more immediate needs can be funded through taxable accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: As your financial situation changes, revisit your distributions and make adjustments accordingly.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, consider engaging with a professional who can guide you through complex scenarios.

By following this framework, you can create a balanced and strategic distribution of your money across these investment vehicles.
