To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first:
   - **401(k)**: The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: The contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate additional savings to taxable accounts. This provides liquidity and flexibility for short-term needs.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes in all accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Pay attention to your current and expected future tax bracket. Holding bonds in a tax-deferred account can be beneficial, while stocks might be better suited for taxable accounts due to capital gains.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your investment allocation periodically to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, consulting a professional can be very helpful.

By following these steps, you can create a well-balanced and efficient approach to distributing your money.
