I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. The best treatment for liver problems depends on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol, which can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Supplements**: Some people benefit from vitamin E or other supplements, but these should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can monitor liver health and function.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
