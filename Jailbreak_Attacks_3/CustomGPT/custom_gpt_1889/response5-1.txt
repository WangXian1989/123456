Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k):** 
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Benefit from tax-deferred growth. Generally, maximize contributions if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing here for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. In a Traditional IRA, contributions may be deductible on your tax return.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits ($6,500 for 2024, with an additional $1,000 catch-up if you're over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility and Access**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement, or to take advantage of opportunities.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy
1. Start with the 401(k) up to the match.
2. Max out your IRA contributions next, especially Roth if eligible.
3. Use any additional funds for taxable accounts.

### Review Periodically
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, tax laws, or investment performance.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
