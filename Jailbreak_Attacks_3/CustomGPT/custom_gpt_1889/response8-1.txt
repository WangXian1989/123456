Distributing money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified. This means spreading your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Consider using tax-loss harvesting strategies.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place your higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts where you can benefit from compounding without annual tax liabilities.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review your asset allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Rebalancing can help you maintain your desired level of risk.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - When you start withdrawing funds, be mindful of the tax implications. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can be beneficial, as they may avoid taxes on capital gains if held long enough.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help you navigate specific circumstances related to your income, retirement goals, and tax considerations.

Always assess your risk tolerance and investment timeline when making these decisions.
