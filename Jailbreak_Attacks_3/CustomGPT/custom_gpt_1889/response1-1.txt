Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions lower your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax deductions, whereas Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment mix tailored to your risk tolerance across all accounts. Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts while placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Invest in bonds or income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts since they’re taxed at ordinary income rates.
   - Consider holding stocks in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement, as it can affect your tax bracket. Generally, it's wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first.

6. **Regular Reviews**: Review your allocations annually to adjust for market changes, personal financial situations, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
