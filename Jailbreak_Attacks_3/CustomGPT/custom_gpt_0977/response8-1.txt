Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. It grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but with income limits for tax-deductible contributions depending on your situation.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here do not have the same tax advantages but offer more flexibility for withdrawals and no penalties for accessing your funds early.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments to balance risk. This could mean investing in stocks, bonds, ETFs, or mutual funds according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds and high-yield funds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Age and Retirement Horizon**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your age and when you plan to retire. Younger investors might focus more on growth in stocks, while older individuals might prioritize capital preservation in bonds.

7. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review your allocations and make adjustments based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial situation or goals.
