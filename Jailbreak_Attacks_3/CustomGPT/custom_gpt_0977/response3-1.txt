Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and retirement goals.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If you can still contribute after funding your IRA, aim to maximize your contributions to your 401(k). For 2024, the limit for employee contributions is $23,000, plus an additional $7,500 if you’re over 50.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments as needed. These accounts offer flexibility and liquidity but come with capital gains taxes on profits. Consider holding investments with lower turnover or municipal bonds in these accounts for tax efficiency.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This might involve a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Pay attention to the tax implications of withdrawing funds from retirement accounts. Generally, it may be advantageous to draw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation and goals.

By strategically allocating your contributions and investments, you can optimize growth and potentially minimize taxes over the long term.
