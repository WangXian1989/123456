Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your age, financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income, you can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes upon withdrawal. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes on any investment income or profits when you sell investments.

3. **Diversification**: 
   - Diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) in all accounts. This can help mitigate risk.

4. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing. This fund is best kept in a readily accessible, low-risk account.

5. **Long-Term Goals vs. Short-Term Needs**: 
   - If you’re saving for long-term retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. If you need liquidity for short-term goals, focus on taxable accounts, as they allow withdrawals without penalties.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: 
   - Periodically assess and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.
