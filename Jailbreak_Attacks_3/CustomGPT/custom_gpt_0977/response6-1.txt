Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Understand Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. You'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA:** Can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Gains are taxed annually, which can affect your overall returns.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Max out contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) first, especially if there's a match.
   - Make contributions to your IRA afterwards, prioritizing Roth IRAs if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Aim for a mix of equities and fixed income based on your risk tolerance in each account type.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with favorable tax treatment, such as qualified dividends or capital gains.

4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have adequate liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies without penalty.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review and adjust your allocation based on market performance and any changes in personal circumstances.

Evaluate your personal financial situation and consider consulting with a financial advisor to customize the strategy to your needs.
