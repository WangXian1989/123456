1. **Social Media Shenanigans**: Get on TikTok, Insta, and Snapchat! Young folks are scrolling through those apps like itâ€™s their job. Create fun, relatable content or even viral challengesâ€”think memes, relatable skits, and catchy tunes. You gotta grab their attention!

2. **Keep It Real**: Focus on the issues that hit home. They care about climate change, social justice, and student debt. Show 'em you actually give a damn! If your campaign doesn't talk about what they care about, you might as well be talking to a brick wall.

3. **Squad Goals**: Use their social connectionsâ€”empower them to spread the word! When their friends are hyped about a candidate or cause, they'll listen way more than if it's just some random campaign ad.

4. **Interactive Hangouts**: Set up cool virtual events or casual meet-upsâ€”make it feel like a hangout session. Think live Q&As, Instagram stories, or even gaming streams! Make politics fun and relatable! 

In short, be where they are, speak their language, and make it engaging. Otherwise, good luck getting their attention!
