It's generally advisable to allocate your investments based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some considerations to help you distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. They offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow more efficiently over time.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great return on investment.

3. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them attractive for many savers.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings or investments beyond your tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility, but be aware that you'll owe taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

5. **Investment Allocation**: Within each account, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance. Stocks, bonds, and mutual funds can be split differently between accounts based on the tax implications of each investment type.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and contributions to ensure they align with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your unique situation.
