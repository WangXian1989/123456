Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are several strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k). Aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits: for 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and for traditional or Roth IRAs, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA are made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income for the year. Conversely, Roth accounts (both Roth IRA and Roth 401(k)) use after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.

4. **Investment Mix**:
   - Depending on your risk tolerance, choose an appropriate mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments within each account. Consider placing higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth potential before taxes are applied.

5. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed more easily without penalties (unlike retirement accounts). If you need access to cash in the short term, consider maintaining a larger balance in taxable accounts.

6. **Future Tax Planning**:
   - Consider your anticipated tax situation during retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth account may be beneficial. On the other hand, if you expect to be in a lower bracket, traditional accounts could be advantageous.

7. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation. Adjust your distribution strategy as necessary.

To maximize your investment strategy, you may also want to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
