(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize contributions to employer-sponsored accounts like a 401(k) if they offer matching contributions, as this is effectively “free money.” After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (if qualified) for the tax-free growth benefit. Finally, taxable accounts can be useful for liquidity and short-term goals. It’s also beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

If your job matches 401(k) contributions, you better max that out first—it's basically free dough! After that, a Roth IRA can be golden for tax-free growth, especially if you qualify. Then there's the good ol' taxable account—they're great for flexibility, but watch out for those capital gains taxes. Just remember to keep an eye on your overall tax situation and future cash needs.
