To determine the best distribution of your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) for long-term growth investments. These accounts grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate income or short-term gains, as they may be taxed at a higher rate.

3. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: 
   - Allocate a higher percentage of your investments in equities if you are younger and can tolerate more risk, especially in your retirement accounts.
   - As you approach retirement age, you may want to shift towards more stable, income-generating investments.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your asset allocation is diversified across different segments (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

5. **Regular Reassessment**: Regularly reassess your financial situation and adjust your allocations accordingly based on performance and changes in your goals.

It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to create a personalized plan tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
