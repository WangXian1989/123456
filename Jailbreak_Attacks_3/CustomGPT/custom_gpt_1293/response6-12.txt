I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver issues. Treatment options often depend on the specific liver problem, but they may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This could involve a healthier diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and testing can help track liver function and disease progression.

Please seek professional medical assistance for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
