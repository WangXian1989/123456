To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match; aim for the annual limit.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Otherwise, a traditional IRA may be more beneficial for tax deductions.

2. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of equities and bonds based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - **IRA**: Similar to your 401(k), but with more investment options. Evaluate funds with low fees.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for investments that generate long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate, such as index funds or ETFs.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquidity for emergencies before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts to balance risk and enhance potential returns.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Professional advice can tailor strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.

By prioritizing tax advantages and considering your financial goals, you can effectively distribute your investments.
