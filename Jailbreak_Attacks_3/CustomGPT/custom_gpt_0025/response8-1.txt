Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider contributing up to the limit ($22,500 for 2023, plus a $7,500 catch-up if over 50).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Focus on maxing out these accounts before taxable accounts.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or if youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility but may incur capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Consider a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your unique situation, consider speaking with a financial professional.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively balance your investments for growth while optimizing your tax situation.
