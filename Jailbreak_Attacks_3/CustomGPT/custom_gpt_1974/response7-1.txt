Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Growth is tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: 
     - Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, growing tax-deferred. 
     - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains. Use this for short-term goals or after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Check Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRAs. For 2024, the limit is $23,000 for 401(k)s (plus catch-up contributions for those 50+) and $6,500 for IRAs.

### 4. **Balanced Allocation**:
   - Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and investment time frame. Generally:
     - More aggressive investments (higher potential returns, higher volatility) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-deferred.

### 5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes across accounts (stocks, bonds, etc.) to spread risk.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals considering tax implications. For example, avoid withdrawing from tax-advantaged accounts unless necessary, as they may incur penalties or tax implications.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess your allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

### Example Strategy:
1. Max out your 401(k) to the employer match.
2. Contribute to an IRA (consider a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement).
3. Allocate any surplus to a taxable account for flexibility.

Being strategic about how you distribute your investments can optimize your growth potential and tax efficiency. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice to your specific situation.
