Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive the full employer match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA**: If your income allows, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions.
   - **401(k)**: After securing the match, consider contributing more to your 401(k). The contribution limits are generally higher than those for IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve utilized tax-advantaged accounts, any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals and no penalties for accessing your funds early, but they'll be subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Diversification**: Distribute your investment types (stocks, bonds, etc.) across accounts to balance risk. Consider a mix of growth and income-generating investments based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically to ensure alignment with your goals, adjusting for changes in income, expenses, or market conditions.
