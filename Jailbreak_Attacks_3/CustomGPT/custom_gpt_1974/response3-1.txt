Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
   - Max out your IRA contributions if eligible.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income; taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs follow the same tax treatment as 401(k)s; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; capital gains and dividends are taxed.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - For long-term growth, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term needs or investments that generate taxable income.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across different asset classes in all accounts to manage risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider how and when you plan to withdraw funds in retirement to optimize tax efficiency.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changing goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized strategy.
