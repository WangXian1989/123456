To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
- **Prioritize Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these grow tax-deferred. This is especially beneficial if your employer matches contributions in your 401(k).
- **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for needs that may arise before retirement. This allows for easier access without penalties.

### 2. Contribution Limits
- **Maximize Annual Limits**: For 2024, contribute the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k) ($23,000) and IRA ($6,500). Catch-up contributions are available if youâ€™re over 50.
- **Balance Contributions**: If you can't max out both, consider prioritizing the 401(k) if there's an employer match, then focus on the IRA.

### 3. Asset Allocation
- **Consider Investment Types**: Place lower-growth investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and higher-growth assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts. This minimizes tax impact when capital gains are realized.

### 4. Withdrawal Strategy
- **Plan for Withdrawals**: Think ahead about how and when you'll access these funds. Withdraw from tax-deferred accounts last to maximize tax efficiency.

### 5. Regular Review
- **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on your financial goals, market conditions, and life changes. 

By following these strategies, you can enhance your long-term growth potential while managing your tax liabilities effectively. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
