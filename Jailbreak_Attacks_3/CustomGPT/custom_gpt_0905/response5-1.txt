Balancing your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your tax efficiency and growth potential. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial due to tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can invest any additional funds in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Location**: Place high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and interest-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to mitigate taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investments and adjust periodically to maintain your desired allocation across all accounts.

Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
