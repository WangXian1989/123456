Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions (up to the limit).
   - **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to an IRA after hitting your 401(k) match. Choose a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

### 2. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - Keep a diverse asset allocation in each account. Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications on interest.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes. Favor investments that yield qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Your withdrawals will be taxed as regular income. Favor investments with a higher rate of turnover or high yield here to defer taxes.

### 4. **Account for Withdrawal Timing**
   - Plan your withdrawals based on your retirement needs. Draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts the opportunity to grow.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess and Rebalance**
   - Review your asset allocation based on your changing life circumstances, market performance, and retirement goals. Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired risk profile.

### Summary
Start by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, diversify your holdings, consider tax implications, plan your withdrawal strategy, and regularly reassess your portfolio. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
