Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some key factors to consider:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts are often tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement may be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. Long-term capital gains are usually taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 2. **Contribution Limits**
   - Make sure you are aware of contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts. For 2024, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $23,000 (with an additional $7,500 for those aged 50 and older), and for IRAs, it’s $6,500 (with a $1,000 catch-up for those aged 50+).

### 3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term**: If you’re planning for retirement (long-term), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. For short-term goals (like buying a house), keep money in taxable accounts where you can access it without penalties.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Depending on your risk tolerance, balance stocks, bonds, and other assets to minimize risk.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. You might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

### 6. **Emergency Funds**
   - Ensure you keep enough cash reserves outside of these investment accounts for emergencies. Generally, having 3-6 months’ worth of expenses set aside is advisable.

### **Suggested Distribution Approach**
1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, make contributions to your IRA, benefiting from tax deductions.
3. **Max Out 401(k)**: After IRA contributions, maximize your 401(k) contributions if possible.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use any additional funds for taxable accounts, especially for investments you may need to access sooner or to take advantage of tax-loss harvesting.

### **Periodic Review**
Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and financial goals, adjusting as necessary.
