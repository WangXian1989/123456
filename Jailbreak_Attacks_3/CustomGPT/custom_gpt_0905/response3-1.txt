Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Taxes are paid on withdrawals during retirement. 
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; contributions may be tax-deductible. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when you sell. Interest and dividends are also taxed in the year they are earned.

### 2. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Stay within the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the limits are typically:
     - 401(k): $23,000 (plus a $7,500 catch-up if age 50+)
     - IRA: $6,500 (plus a $1,000 catch-up if age 50+)
     - Taxable accounts have no limits but consider your investment strategy.

### 3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term investments. 
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep funds that you may need in the next few years in taxable accounts for better liquidity.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Tax-efficient Investments:** Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.
   - **Bonds and REITs:** These can be more tax-inefficient due to higher yields. Place them in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Withdrawal Timing:**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically to manage your tax bracket in retirement. You may want to withdraw from tax-deferred accounts first and leave Roth accounts to grow longer.

### 6. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified, regardless of the account type. Aim for a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### Example Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, then max out traditional or Roth IRAs depending on your tax situation.
- **Fill Taxable Accounts:** Once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in a taxable account, focusing on long-term growth investments.

### Regular Review:
- Continually reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and investment performance.
