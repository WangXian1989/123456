When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and expected time horizon for each investment. Hereâ€™s a simplified approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, and the money grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth might be more beneficial.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the contribution limits for IRAs. For 2023, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may want to access before retirement without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of the tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Prioritize Contributions**: Generally, you might start by contributing enough to get the match in your 401(k), then max out your IRA, and finally invest in taxable accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified to manage risk.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations to make sure they align with your financial goals and adjust as necessary based on market conditions or changes in your financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor may also help tailor a strategy unique to your circumstances.
