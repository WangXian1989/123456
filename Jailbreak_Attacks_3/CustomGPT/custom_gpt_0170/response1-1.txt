To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA since they provide tax benefits. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional Accounts**: If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) for tax-free withdrawals. Traditional accounts provide tax deductions now but tax you upon withdrawal.

3. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Diversify your investments within each account type to manage risk. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Emergency Fund in Taxable Accounts**: Maintain an emergency fund in your taxable account for easy access without penalties. This fund should cover 3 to 6 months of living expenses.

5. **Debt Repayment Consideration**: If you have high-interest debt, consider using excess funds to pay it down before making large contributions. This can offer a better return on investment compared to potential account gains.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**: Periodically review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

7. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burden.

Before deciding on specific allocations, it may be wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
