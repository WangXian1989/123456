To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types and Their Benefits:**
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer contributions, pre-tax contributions, and tax-deferred growth. Ideal for maximizing contributions, especially if your employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Provides tax advantages, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in the case of Roth IRAs. Consider your eligibility based on income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While these do not offer tax benefits, they provide flexibility with fewer withdrawal restrictions and can be useful for short-term goals.

2. **Establish Your Goals:**
   - Identify whether your goals are short-term (like saving for a home), medium-term (like a major purchase), or long-term (retirement, education).
   - This will help decide how much to allocate to each account type based on liquidity needs and tax implications.

3. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match.
   - Next, maximize your IRA contributions (both traditional and Roth options) depending on tax implications based on your income level.
   - Finally, funnel any remaining savings into your taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Evaluate your current and expected future tax bracket. Traditional accounts offer tax breaks now, while Roth accounts may offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - Taxable accounts incur capital gains tax on profits, so it can be wise to hold low-turnover investments there (e.g., index funds).

5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Allocate investments in a way that balances risk and return based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. 
   - Ensure that the mix of stocks, bonds, and cash aligns with your overall investment strategy.

6. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your account allocations and adjust as necessary to stay aligned with changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and investment goals.
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For a personalized approach, consider consulting with a financial advisor. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

This strategy helps you maximize the benefits of each account type while aligning with your overall financial goals.
