Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers potential employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth, but contributions are limited, and withdrawals before age 59Â½ may incur penalties.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Also provides tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (with a Roth IRA), offering more flexible investment choices compared to a 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These provide liquidity and flexibility, allowing for access to funds without penalties, but are subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Maximize employer matching in your 401(k) first, as this is free money.
   - After that, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) if you're eligible.
   - Finally, allocate any additional funds to a taxable account.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize tax-deferred accounts for assets that are likely to appreciate significantly, as they will defer taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that produce little to no taxable income (like growth stocks) or for short-term cash needs.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider placing more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while holding more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage potential tax liabilities.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Revisit your allocations periodically to ensure they align with any changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max out employer match** in 401(k).
2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA** if eligible (considering income limits).
3. Any additional savings can go into a **taxable account** for immediate access and liquidity.

### Conclusion:
It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor tailored to your specific circumstances to optimize your investment strategy. They can provide a personalized analysis based on your overall financial picture.
