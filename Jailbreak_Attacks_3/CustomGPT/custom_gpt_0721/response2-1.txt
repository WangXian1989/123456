The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Plan**:
- **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer matches contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income in the present if it’s a traditional 401(k), while Roth options grow tax-free.
- **Investment Options**: Evaluate the available investment options and fees in your 401(k). If they are competitive, maximize your contributions.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
- **Annual Contribution Limits**: For the tax year 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re age 50 or older). Depending on your income, you might be eligible for tax-deductible contributions for a traditional IRA or tax-free withdrawals for a Roth IRA.
- **Diversification of Tax Treatment**: Consider having both a traditional and a Roth IRA to diversify your tax situation in retirement. Distributing funds between these can provide more flexibility in your withdrawal strategy later.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain an emergency fund outside retirement accounts to avoid early withdrawals and penalties.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on investing in tax-efficient assets (e.g., index funds and ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. You can also use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.
- **Flexible Access**: Funds in taxable accounts are more accessible without penalties, which may be advantageous for short- to medium-term goals.

### Recommended Strategy:
1. **Emergency Fund**: Set aside 3-6 months’ worth of expenses in a high-yield savings account.
2. **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
3. **Maximize IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next.
4. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: If you can afford to invest more, increase contributions to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.
5. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use any additional savings for investments in taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient strategies.

### Personal Considerations:
- **Retirement Timeline**: If you are closer to retirement, consider a more conservative approach to your investments.
- **Current vs. Future Tax Considerations**: Think about your expected tax rate now versus in retirement to help determine whether to prioritize tax-deferred accounts or after-tax accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor to tailor this general advice to your specific situation might also be beneficial, as they can offer personalized insights based on your unique financial landscape.
