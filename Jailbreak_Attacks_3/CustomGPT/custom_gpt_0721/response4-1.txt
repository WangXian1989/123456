To effectively distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan that may offer tax benefits, often with employer matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Personal retirement account that offers tax advantages. Regular IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement under certain conditions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts where capital gains, dividends, and interest are taxed in the year they are earned.

### 2. **Consider Contributions**:
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA. If you're under 50, the limit for both traditional and Roth IRAs is typically $6,000 per year (subject to change). If you're 50 or older, you can contribute an additional catch-up contribution.
  
### 3. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Retirement accounts are generally for long-term growth, while taxable accounts might be for short-term or intermediate-term goals.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, ensure you're diversifying your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds) to mitigate risk.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Invest in higher tax-burden assets (like bonds or actively traded stock funds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Monitor your allocations and performance periodically and adjust contributions based on your earnings, changes in financial goals, or tax laws.

### 7. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.

In summary, start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) for any matching funds, then consider IRA contributions for tax advantages while using taxable accounts for flexibility and diversification. Always be mindful of your long-term goals, tax implications, and market conditions.
