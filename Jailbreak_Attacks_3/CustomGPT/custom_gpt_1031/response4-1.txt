Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maximizing contributions to this account if you are in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA**: Both Traditional IRAs (tax-deductible contributions) and Roth IRAs (tax-free withdrawals) offer tax advantages. Evaluate your current and expected future tax situation to decide which type of IRA is more beneficial for you.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals and can be a good place for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to mitigate risk. This includes a mix of asset types like stocks, bonds, and real estate.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As retirement approaches, consider how you will withdraw from these accounts. Typically, it is advisable to draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocations based on performance, changing tax laws, and shifts in your financial goals.

It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that suits your individual circumstances.
