The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general guideline to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Focus on maxing out contributions (the limit for 2023 is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're over 50). The tax advantages of a 401(k), including tax-deferred growth and possible employer contributions, can make it a significant part of your retirement savings.

2. **IRAs (Traditional and Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, you might choose to contribute to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions and taxable withdrawals) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions and tax-free withdrawals). Consider contributing to an IRA if you have maximized your 401(k) contributions and are eligible based on income limits. The annual contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 and over) for 2023.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can provide flexibility since they do not have contribution limits or early withdrawal penalties. They are useful for goals that have a shorter time horizon than retirement, as funds can be accessed more freely. When investing in taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Overall Strategy:
- **Maximize Your 401(k) Contribution**: Aim for the maximum permissible limit while ensuring to capture any employer matching.
- **Utilize an IRA**: After maxing your 401(k), contribute to an IRA to take advantage of tax benefits depending on your choice of Traditional or Roth.
- **Invest in a Taxable Account**: Use these accounts for extra savings that you might need access to before retirement, and focus on tax-efficient investment strategies.

It's essential to consider your overall financial situation, including your current earnings, tax brackets, and retirement goals. You may also want to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific needs.
