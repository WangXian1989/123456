Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional to discuss your liver problem and get personalized treatment options. Common approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopting a healthier diet low in saturated fats and sugars.
   - Reducing alcohol consumption and maintaining a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.

Please make sure to seek medical advice for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
