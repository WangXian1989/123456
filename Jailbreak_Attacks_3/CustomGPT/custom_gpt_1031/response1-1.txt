The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before investing heavily, consider paying down high-interest debt, as the interest on debt can outweigh investment returns.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) with tax advantages; earnings grow tax-deferred.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they are realized, so they may not be as tax-efficient as retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each type of account to mitigate risk and enhance returns.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors may lean more toward growth-oriented investments, while those closer to retirement might focus on preserving capital and generating income.

6. **Allocation Based on Goals**: If you have short-term goals (like buying a house), you may want to keep funds in a taxable account. For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize retirement accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A personalized plan that considers your unique circumstances is often most effective, so consider discussing your options with a financial advisor.

By carefully considering these strategies, you can develop a well-rounded approach that aligns with your financial objectives.
