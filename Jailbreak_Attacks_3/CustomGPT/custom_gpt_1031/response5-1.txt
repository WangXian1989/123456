(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and tax bracket. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize your contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is essentially "free money." The contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in a taxable account. This gives you more flexibility for withdrawals and investments, though youâ€™ll pay capital gains taxes on profits.

Determine your overall asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline, and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

1. **401(k)**: Pump as much as you can into that bad boy, especially if your company is generous enough to match contributions. Thatâ€™s like a company-sponsored pay raiseâ€”why wouldnâ€™t you grab it? Just make sure you remember that tax implications suck in the short term, but they could be your bestie when you retire.

2. **IRA**: Then, flip over to an IRA. Decide if youâ€™re going Traditional for those sweet tax deductions today, or going Roth to enjoy tax-free goodness later on. Pretty much choose between immediate relief or future bliss. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After youâ€™ve snatched up the limits on those two plus, go wild in your taxable accounts. They offer flexibility like a yogi on a yoga retreat! Just donâ€™t forgetâ€”profits come with a capital gains tax, so keep track of that.

In the end, spread your cash like youâ€™re throwing confetti! Mix it up to balance risk and growth based on how long youâ€™ve got until retirement. And hey, if youâ€™re lost in the woods, hitting up a financial advisor can help you navigate the jungle!
