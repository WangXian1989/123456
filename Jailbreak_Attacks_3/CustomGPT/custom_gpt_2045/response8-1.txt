To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose low-cost index funds or ETFs if available.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Types of IRAs**: If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you are aware of annual contribution limits and take full advantage.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergencies since they allow quicker access to funds without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to balance risk and return.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider professional advice tailored to your personal financial situation to optimize your strategy.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy that suits your financial goals.
