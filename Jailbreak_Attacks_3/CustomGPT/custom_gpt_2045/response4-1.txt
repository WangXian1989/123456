Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a basic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth). This can provide tax advantages, depending on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum annual limit. Focus on tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. These are beneficial for short-term goals or after maxing out retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and investment timeline across all accounts. Consider placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically assess your allocations and adjust as necessary to stay aligned with your goals.
