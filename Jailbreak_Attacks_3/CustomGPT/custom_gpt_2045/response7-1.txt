The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guide:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the maximum match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it’s a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for extra savings after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay taxes on any dividends or capital gains realized.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Investment Goals**
   - If you plan to retire early or need access to funds before retirement, prioritize taxable accounts for more liquidity.
   - Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon; longer-term investments can typically afford more risk.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy based on comprehensive financial planning, including your current financial situation and future goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% up to the match, then 5% thereafter
- **IRA**: Max out contributions annually
- **Taxable Accounts**: Direct any extra savings, depending on your cash flow and emergency fund needs

Craft your distribution based on these principles, adapting them as your situation changes.
