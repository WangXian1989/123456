To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Evaluate Contribution Limits
- **401(k):** Max out contributions, especially if your employer offers matching funds.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowable amount to your IRA (Roth or Traditional) and consider income limits.

### 2. Tax Efficiency
- **401(k):** Ideal for pre-tax contributions; reduces taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed.
- **IRA:** 

  - **Traditional IRA:** Tax-deductible contributions; taxes on withdrawals.
  - **Roth IRA:** Tax-free withdrawals in retirement; contributions are made after-tax.
  
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in assets with long-term capital gains to minimize taxes. Focus on investments that yield qualified dividends.

### 3. Diversify Investments
- **401(k):** Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and funds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **IRA:** Align investments with retirement goals, potentially including more aggressive options in a Roth IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for short- to medium-term savings and investments that you plan to touch before retirement.

### 4. Regularly Rebalance
Regularly assess and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk levels.

### Conclusion
The optimal distribution varies based on your individual circumstances, including tax situation, retirement goals, and investment horizon. A balanced approach, prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts, is generally recommended. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
