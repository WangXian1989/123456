Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Take Advantage of Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred. Consider maxing this out if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Determine which is better based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more flexible investments or short-term savings. Keep in mind that youâ€™ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider asset location strategies, placing tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Consult a Professional**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.
