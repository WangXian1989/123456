I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver issues. Treatment options can vary based on the specific condition affecting your liver, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit alcohol intake and avoid saturated fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral medications for viral hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track the progression of liver disease and the effectiveness of treatments.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplant may be necessary.

Always follow the guidance of a healthcare provider to determine the best treatment for your specific situation.
