Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you’re eligible. This provides tax-deferred growth (traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth IRA).
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Once you’ve secured the employer match, prioritize contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as they can be more tax-efficient. Consider holding low-turnover index funds or ETFs in these accounts.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Keep assets that appreciate significantly in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes until withdrawal.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s second, and tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs last to maximize tax efficiency.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can provide tailored strategies based on your unique circumstances.

Always evaluate your individual situation or consult a financial professional for advice specific to your needs.
