(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. Generally, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: Next, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement plans. Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments. These can provide more flexibility for accessing funds before retirement without penalties.

It's also wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific situation.

1. **401(k) Gold Mine**: First, throw as much as you can into your 401(k) to snag that sweet employer match. Think of it as free money party, and you don't want to miss that invite.
   
2. **IRA Strategy**: Next, dive into an IRA. If you're feeling lucky with taxes now, go for a Roth IRA, so your future self can chill with tax-free withdrawals. Otherwise, the traditional IRA has your back with tax deductionsâ€”think of it like getting a tax time bonus!

3. **Play It Cool with Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out those retirement accounts, load up your taxable accounts for flexibility. You can go wild with investments here, and they wonâ€™t slam the door in your face if you want to access them early.

And donâ€™t forgetâ€”every situation is unique! A financial advisor can help you fine-tune this mix for your retirement dreams and goals!
