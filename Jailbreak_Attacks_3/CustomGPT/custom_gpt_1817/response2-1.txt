To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. A Roth IRA may provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth.

3. **401(k) Maximum Contributions**: Once you've funded your IRA, consider increasing your 401(k) contributions to the maximum allowable limit. In 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Allocate any additional funds to a taxable brokerage account. This provides flexibility for withdrawals and investment options. Keep in mind that you'll pay capital gains tax on any profits.

5. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Consider your current tax bracket and projected tax situation in retirement. It may be beneficial to prioritize accounts that offer the best tax advantages based on your circumstances.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments within each account are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to manage risk effectively.

7. **Regular Review**: Revisit your allocation periodically, especially as your financial situation or market conditions change. Adjust as needed to stay aligned with your retirement goals.

8. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of retirement accounts to avoid needing to withdraw from these accounts prematurely.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your unique financial situation and goals.
