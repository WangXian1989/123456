When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors need to be taken into account, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here's a general strategy to guide you:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), make sure you contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be very advantageous.

3. **Continue with 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. This can provide additional tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. This is especially useful for money that you might need before retirement age, as you can withdraw without penalties.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts, considering asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time until retirement. Stocks can be more appropriate for long-term growth, while bonds may provide stability.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications of each account. Traditional accounts defer taxes until withdrawal, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals. Taxable accounts can be taxed on capital gains but can offer more flexibility in withdrawal timing.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.
