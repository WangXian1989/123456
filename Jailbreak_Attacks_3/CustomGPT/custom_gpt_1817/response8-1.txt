Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Contribute to Your Employer's 401(k)** 
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, and the account grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.

### 2. **Consider a Traditional or Roth IRA** 
   - **Tax Considerations**: Depending on your tax bracket and current income, choose between a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) or a Roth IRA (post-tax contributions).
   - **Contribution Limits**: Make sure to adhere to contribution limits for each account type ($6,500 for 2024; $7,500 if you're over 50).

### 3. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts** 
   - **Liquidity Needs**: If you might need access to your funds before retirement, having a taxable account can provide flexibility without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains Management**: Taxable accounts allow for capital gains management and tax-loss harvesting.

### 4. **Diversify Investments** 
   - **Asset Allocation**: Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting investments based on the risk tolerance of each account type.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals** 
   - **Focus on Long-Term Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to accounts with more favorable tax treatment (e.g., 401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts unless short-term liquidity is needed.

### 6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor** 
   - **Professional Guidance**: Consider discussing your strategy with a financial advisor who can offer personalized advice based on your complete financial picture.

By following this structured approach, you'll ensure a balanced strategy that maximizes tax efficiency and aligns with your financial goals.
