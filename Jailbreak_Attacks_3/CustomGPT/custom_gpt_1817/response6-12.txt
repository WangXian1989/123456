I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options can vary significantly based on the specific condition (e.g., fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis). Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** A balanced diet low in fats, sugar, and salt can help reduce liver strain.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity aids weight management and liver health.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antiviral Drugs:** For viral hepatitis, medications like entecavir or tenofovir may be prescribed.
   - **Corticosteroids:** To reduce inflammation in certain liver conditions.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - **Blood Tests:** Regular liver function tests to monitor health and progression.
   - **Imaging Studies:** Ultrasounds or CT scans to assess liver structure and damage.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment tailored to your specific situation.
