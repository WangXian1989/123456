I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Improving diet (low in fat, sugar, and salt), increasing exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly benefit liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), your doctor may prescribe antiviral medications, corticosteroids, or other drugs.

3. **Nutritional Supplements**: Some supplements, like milk thistle or vitamin E, may be beneficial, but it's crucial to discuss this with a physician.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and lab tests can help monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, like liver cirrhosis or liver cancer, surgical options may be necessary, including liver transplantation.

Please consult a healthcare professional for the best course of action tailored to your specific situation.
