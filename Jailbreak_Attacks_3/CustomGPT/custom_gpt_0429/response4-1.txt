To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Ideal for high-income earners who expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Good if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to 401(k) in terms of contributions being tax-deductible, but has income limits for deductibility.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Determine whether your investments are for short-term or long-term goals. Longer time horizons can handle more volatility.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and goals.
   - Tax-efficient investments (like municipal bonds) can be placed in taxable accounts, while less tax-efficient (like REITs) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you intend to withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: 
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and investment performance to ensure alignment with your goals and risk tolerance.

Ultimately, the optimal distribution depends on your financial situation, tax bracket, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
