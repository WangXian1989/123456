Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Max Out Employers' Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first—it's essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.

2. **Prioritize Your 401(k)**:
   - After maximizing the match, direct more funds into your 401(k) if it has low fees and good investment options. The higher contribution limits compared to IRAs make it a valuable vehicle for retirement savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Utilize taxable accounts for money you may need before retirement or for short-term goals. They provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and often have favorable capital gains tax rates.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk and return. Consider asset allocation strategies that suit your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Re-evaluate Periodically**:
   - Regularly assess your distribution strategy based on changing circumstances—such as income fluctuations, life events, and market conditions—to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you’re unsure how to allocate your funds effectively, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy balances growth potential, tax efficiency, and your personal financial needs.
