The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax advantages to a 401(k) in terms of deductions, but also offers a Roth option, where contributions are made post-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer tax advantages, but you have more flexibility in terms of withdrawals.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts. Typically, 3-6 months of expenses set aside is recommended.

4. **Debt Consideration**: If you have high-interest debt, it may be wise to pay that off first before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, more aggressive investments can be placed in accounts meant for long-term growth (like your 401(k) or IRA), while more conservative investments can occupy your taxable accounts.

6. **After-Tax Contributions**: If you're maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, consider making after-tax contributions to your taxable accounts for additional flexibility.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your future withdrawals strategically to minimize your tax burden. For instance, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-advantaged accounts, depending on your income needs and tax bracket.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary greatly, so working with a financial planner may help tailor a plan to your specific needs.

Each of these considerations plays a crucial role, and the optimal distribution can vary based on individual circumstances.

For more personalized advice, you may want to consult with a financial planner or advisor who can account for your specific financial situation and goals.
