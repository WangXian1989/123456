To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Diversification of Accounts**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Use for investments that generate ordinary income or high turnover, as taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like ETFs) and long-term investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - If youâ€™re younger, focus more on growth in your 401(k) and IRA. If nearing retirement, shift towards more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

### Monitoring and Adjustments
- Regularly review and reallocate as needed based on performance and changing tax laws.

This balanced approach leverages the strengths of each account type while optimizing for taxes and long-term growth.
