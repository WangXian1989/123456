Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, as they offer tax advantages. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may lower your taxable income now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate money to taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, though they may incur capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Invest in tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes, and hold bonds or other interest-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts, aligning with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you’ll access these funds in retirement. Typically, it’s advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred and then tax-free accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
