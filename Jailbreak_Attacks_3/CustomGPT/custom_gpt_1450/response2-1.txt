When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. If possible, aim for the maximum contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. This helps grow your investments tax-free or tax-deferred.

2. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or for investments that generate qualified dividends (lower tax rates) or long-term capital gains.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - In all accounts, consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Monitor Tax Situations**:
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts. Use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - In retirement, prioritize withdrawals from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailoring your strategy to your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation can provide more personalized guidance.

Regularly review and adjust your strategy based on performance and changing life circumstances.
