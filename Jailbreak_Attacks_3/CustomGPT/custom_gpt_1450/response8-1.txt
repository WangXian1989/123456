Balancing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors such as your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, particularly for a Roth IRA, consider contributing the maximum allowed. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) since they can benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - Hold more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where interest income might be taxed at a higher rate.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically generate fewer taxable events.
   - Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, and life events.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It can be beneficial to consult with a professional who can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

This strategy helps you leverage the tax benefits of each account type effectively.
