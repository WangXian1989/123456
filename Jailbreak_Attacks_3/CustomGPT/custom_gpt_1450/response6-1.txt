Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions upfront.

### 2. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Impact**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains, as long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Focus on investments that might generate higher taxable income, like bonds, to defer taxes until withdrawal.

### 3. **Consider Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals**: If you're saving for retirement (10+ years away), lean towards growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Shorter-Term Goals**: Keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts for flexibility without early withdrawal penalties.

### 4. **Adjust for Future Tax Rates**
   - Diversifying with both Roth and traditional accounts can provide flexibility in retirement. Consider your expected future tax rate when deciding where to allocate funds.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 20-30% of total savings, prioritizing to the maximum employer match.
- **IRA**: 10-15%, fully utilizing any tax advantages.
- **Taxable Accounts**: 10-20%, focusing on flexible and lower-tax-generating investments.

### Final Thoughts
- Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and tax laws.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies that fit your specific circumstances.
