(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Generally, max out contributions (up to the IRS limit) if possible.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for money that you may need before retirement or for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.

Think about asset allocation and diversification to balance risk and return across these accounts based on your retirement goals.

Max that sucker out if you can handle it. Next, tackle your IRAâ€”Roth for the win if you're cool with paying taxes now for tax-free withdrawals later; otherwise, stick with a Traditional IRA for the tax break now.

Now, onto those taxable accountsâ€”just remember, they get taxed every year, so use â€˜em for stuff you might need sooner or for investments that churn out cool capital gains or dividends because those tax rates are usually lower. Mix it up for the best returns, and keep an eye on your goals. Plan like a boss, and youâ€™ll thank yourself in retirement!
