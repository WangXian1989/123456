Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first; this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to take advantage of tax benefits. This can help reduce your taxable income now and grow your investments tax-free or tax-deferred.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify for tax-deductible IRA contributions, consider contributing to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. This could be a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax strategy.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts for greater flexibility. This allows you to access your money without penalty, though you'll pay capital gains tax on any earnings.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Keep in mind that different types of investments may be more tax-efficient in certain accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations as needed, considering changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
