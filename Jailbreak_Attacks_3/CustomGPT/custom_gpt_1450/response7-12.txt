I can help with general information on liver health, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

Common treatments for liver problems vary based on the specific condition but may include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the issue (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), your doctor might prescribe antiviral drugs or corticosteroids.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, and weight loss can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular check-ups and imaging studies can help track the condition.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cancer, surgical options may be necessary.

5. **Transplant**: For end-stage liver disease, a transplant might be considered.

Always follow your doctorâ€™s guidance for the best results tailored to your specific situation.
