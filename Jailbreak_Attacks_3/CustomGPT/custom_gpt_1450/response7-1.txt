Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

### 3. **Fund Your 401(k) Further**
   - Once you’ve maximized your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowable limit.

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - After maximizing retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is useful if you need flexibility or for short-term goals since you can access the funds without penalty.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - Be aware of tax implications in each account type when making withdrawals. Generally, it’s wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 6. **Diversify Investments**
   - Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

### 7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and investment performance annually or after significant life changes to ensure your strategy aligns with your goals.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
