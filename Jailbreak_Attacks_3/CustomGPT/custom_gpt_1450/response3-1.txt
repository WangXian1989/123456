Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough to get the full employer match**: This is essentially free money and a great place to start.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now but taxes will apply upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to 401(k) in tax treatment, contributions can be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments incur capital gains taxes on realized gains.

### 3. **Emergency Fund First**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing in stocks or mutual funds.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to mitigate risk.
   - Consider placing more tax-efficient investments (like stocks or ETFs) in taxable accounts, and tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Debt Consideration**
   - Pay off high-interest debt before fully funding retirement accounts.

### 6. **Long-Term Goals**
   - Align investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors can generally take more risk.

### 7. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on performance, changing goals, or market conditions.

### Suggested Contribution Order
1. Max out the employer match in your 401(k).
2. Contribute to a Roth IRA (if eligible).
3. Continue funding your 401(k) up to the max limit.
4. Consider taxable accounts for additional investing flexibility.

### Conclusion
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation, as individual circumstances can vary widely.
