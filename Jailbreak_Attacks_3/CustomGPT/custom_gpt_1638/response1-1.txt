To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for short-term goals or when you need liquidity. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to reduce risk.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Determine your financial goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.). Longer horizons can afford more risk in stocks, while shorter ones may need safer investments.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired balance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, especially regarding tax implications and investment strategies.

By focusing on tax efficiency and aligning your investments with your goals, you'll create a balanced approach to managing your money.
