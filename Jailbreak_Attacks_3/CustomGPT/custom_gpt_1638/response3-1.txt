Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here’s a breakdown of strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match: Ensure you contribute enough to get the full match.
   - Consider pre-tax vs. Roth contributions based on your current and expected future tax rates.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Prioritize Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax situation. 
   - If eligible, try to max out IRA contributions ($6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 if 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Guidelines:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings set aside for emergencies before investing heavily.
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon across all account types.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Sample Allocation Strategy:
- Consider a framework like:
  - **401(k)**: 50%
  - **IRA**: 30%
  - **Taxable Accounts**: 20%

### Final Thoughts:
- Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
- Keep an eye on fees and performance in each account type.

This strategic allocation can help you optimize growth while managing risks and taxes effectively.
