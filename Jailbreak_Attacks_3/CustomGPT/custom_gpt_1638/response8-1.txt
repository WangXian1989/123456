Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is free money and offers immediate returns.

2. **Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum limit if you have a solid investment strategy and low fees. Focus on tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect your tax rate to be higher then. A traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits if you're in a higher tax bracket now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals but will be subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Invest Based on Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment time horizon across all accounts.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio according to changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your unique situation.
