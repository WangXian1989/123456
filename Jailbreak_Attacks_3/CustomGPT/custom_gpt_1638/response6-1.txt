To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify, prioritize maxing out your IRA contributions to benefit from tax advantages.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Favor tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Allocate Based on Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Focus on aggressive growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more liquid and less volatile investments in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Ensure a balanced mix of stocks and bonds across all accounts to manage risk effectively, taking into consideration your overall risk tolerance and investment goals. 

By strategically balancing contributions across these accounts while considering tax implications and investment timelines, you can optimize your financial growth and retirement preparedness.
