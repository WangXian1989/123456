To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if feasible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.

2. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid, accessible account before heavily investing in accounts with withdrawal penalties.

3. **Debt Management**:
   - Pay off high-interest debt before investing significantly. This ensures better long-term financial health.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to each account's tax implications.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold stocks in taxable accounts for long-term capital gains tax benefits.
   - Keep bonds and high-yield assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Revisit and adjust your allocations annually to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Planner**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your entire financial situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
