Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Ideal for high earners.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on current vs. expected future tax rates.

### 3. **Diversify Contributions**
   - If you are under the contribution limits, consider spreading your contributions:
     - **401(k)**: Up to the annual limit (check for updates).
     - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Max out up to the allowed amount ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 as of 2023).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement or for short-term goals. They provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 5. **Consider Investment Strategy**
   - Assets with high growth potential can do well in tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., stocks in 401(k)/IRA), while income-generating investments (e.g., bonds) might be better in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 6. **Review Annually**
   - Re-evaluate your allocations based on changes in income, rates of return, or modifications in retirement goals.

### Conclusion
Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your unique situation and goals.
