I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. For liver problems, treatment options often depend on the specific condition. Common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the illness (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).
3. **Supplements**: Antioxidants or herbal supplements, after consulting a healthcare provider.
4. **Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies to track liver function.
5. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsies or transplants may be necessary.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
