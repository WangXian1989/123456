Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally offers higher contribution limits. It's a good place for long-term growth, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA**: Consider using a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to increase in retirement, as it allows tax-free withdrawals. A Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: 
   - If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, traditional accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) are advantageous since you'll be taxed at a lower rate when you withdraw funds.
   - For higher earners, maxing out tax-deferred accounts is often smart to reduce taxable income now.

4. **Consider Financial Goals**: If you have short- to medium-term goals (like buying a home), prioritize taxable accounts since they offer more flexibility without penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across these accounts. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets aligned with your risk tolerance.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As markets fluctuate and your accounts grow, periodically reassess your asset allocation to ensure alignment with your retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can be invaluable. They can help create a strategy that fits your unique financial landscape.

### Example Distribution Approach:
- **401(k)**: Max out your contribution to capture the employer match, then consider contributing additional funds up to the annual limit if it fits your budget.
- **IRA**: If eligible, max out contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your income and future tax expectations.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds here for flexibility and short-term goals.

Remember, the key is balancing immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential, so adjust your approach as your financial situation changes.
