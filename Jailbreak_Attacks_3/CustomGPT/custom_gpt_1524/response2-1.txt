When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key principles to maximize your investment strategy:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Both are tax-advantaged accounts. Contributions may be pre-tax (like a traditional 401(k) or IRA), reducing current taxable income, or post-tax (like a Roth IRA), allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are subject to capital gains tax. Be mindful of short-term vs. long-term capital gains.

2. **Contribute to Employer Match**:
   - Start with your 401(k) up to the employer match limit. This is essentially "free money" for your retirement.

3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Next, consider maxing out an IRA (Roth or traditional, depending on your tax situation). If eligible, allocate funds here for the tax benefits.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - In your 401(k) and IRA, choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - In taxable accounts, consider keeping more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize tax implications.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Allocate more to stocks if you have a longer time before needing the funds, especially in tax-advantaged accounts where tax-free growth can be maximized.

6. **Adjust Based on Income Fluctuations**:
   - If your income increases, reassess your contributions to ensure you are optimizing for tax implications and retirement goals.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and rebalance your portfolio at least annually to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

8. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consult with a financial advisor if you're unsure about the best allocation strategy based on your unique situation.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize growth and tax efficiency.
