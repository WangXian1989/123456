To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first. These accounts offer tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (in the case of a Roth IRA). Aim to meet your employer's contribution match for the 401(k) if available.

2. **Asset Allocation**: Properly allocate investments among these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, placing higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts can be beneficial, while more stable investments (like bonds) can be in taxable accounts.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Taxable accounts are more flexible for early withdrawals, while tax-advantaged accounts may incur penalties if accessed before retirement age. Plan accordingly to minimize tax liabilities during retirement.

4. **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50). 

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your investment allocation across all accounts to maintain your target asset allocation and manage risk.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts. Favor long-term capital gains over short-term gains to reduce tax burdens.
