To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Contribute the maximum allowable limit if possible.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Allocate Based on Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus more on equities (stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Income Generation:** Consider placing income-generating assets (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts, where the taxes on dividends and interest will be less advantageous in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains and minimize taxable income. Focus on investments with favorable long-term capital gains rates.
   - **Asset Location:** Place higher-yield and taxable investments in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Adjust your allocations annually based on performance and to ensure alignment with your investment goals.

### 5. **Emergency Fund Consideration**
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund in a liquid savings account, distinct from these investment accounts.

### Example Allocation Approach:
- **401(k)**: 60% of total contributions (max out employer match).
- **IRA**: 20% (balance after 401(k)).
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20% (after maximizing tax-advantaged options).

### Conclusion
Your specific allocation may vary based on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
