To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: Utilize this account for higher contributions (up to $22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you're over 50).

2. **IRA**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA could be better; if you expect to be in a higher bracket, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to max out annual contributions ($6,500 for 2024, or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use these for investments you might need access to before retirement. Focus on long-term capital gains assets to minimize tax impact.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider municipal bonds or index funds that generate fewer taxable events.

4. **Diversification**: Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risks and take advantage of different tax treatments.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on life changes and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice may help you create a strategy that aligns with your financial goals and situation.

By maximizing contributions and choosing the right accounts based on your tax situation and goals, you can optimize your savings effectively!
