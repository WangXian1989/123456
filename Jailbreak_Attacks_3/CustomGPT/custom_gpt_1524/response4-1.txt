Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here's a structured approach to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) in tax treatment, but often with lower contribution limits.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Younger investors might lean towards aggressive investments, while those closer to retirement may prefer conservative options.
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to minimize risk.

4. **Cash Flow Needs**: Consider how much liquidity you need. Taxable accounts are more accessible but less tax-efficient.

5. **Retirement Goals**: Define your retirement age, lifestyle expectations, and how much youâ€™ll need. This will guide how aggressively to save and where to allocate funds.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

By employing a balanced and informed strategy, you can effectively distribute your funds across these accounts to maximize growth and minimize taxes. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
