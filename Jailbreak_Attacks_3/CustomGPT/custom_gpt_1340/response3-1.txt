Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matching Contributions**  
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**  
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k). If you qualify, also consider a Roth IRA, where contributions are made after-tax, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed on dividends and capital gains, so invest here after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions**  
   - **401(k)**: Max out to the employer match.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, if eligible. If not, contribute to a Traditional IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**  
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Focus on long-term growth with a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.
   - **Taxable**: Generally favor investments with lower turnover to minimize tax impact.

### 5. **Regular Review**  
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and personal circumstances.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**  
   - For personalized advice based on your unique financial situation and goals, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

By following this strategy, you can build a balanced approach that maximizes growth while minimizing your tax burden.
