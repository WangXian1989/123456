To optimally distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
     - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (considered free money).
     - Max out your IRA contributions if eligible, as they provide tax-free growth (Roth) or tax-deferred growth (Traditional).

### 2. **Diversification and Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Location**:
     - Place high-growth, tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts.
     - Keep income-generating investments (like bonds or REITs) in taxable accounts to minimize taxable income in the tax-advantaged accounts.
   
### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Adjust contributions based on your current and expected future tax brackets, potentially shifting more to Roth accounts if you anticipate higher taxes later.

### 4. **Annual Rebalancing**
   - Regularly rebalance your investment allocation to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals, considering market fluctuations.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement to optimize tax efficiency, withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

By focusing on these principles, you can create a balanced and effective distribution strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
