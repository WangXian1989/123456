Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRAs:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **401(k):** Aim to max out your contributions ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if 50 or older).

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - In your 401(k) and IRA, focus on long-term investments that can grow tax-deferred or tax-free (in the case of a Roth IRA).
   - In taxable accounts, prefer tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - Contributions to a Traditional 401(k) or IRA can reduce taxable income for the current year.
   - Withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts are generally taxed as ordinary income, while long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at lower rates.

5. **Maintain an Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have liquidity available in a separate savings account or cash reserves before fully investing all your funds.

6. **Reassess Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.
