Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially if thereâ€™s a company match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once your tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out, invest in a taxable account. This is useful for short-term goals or flexibility.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Traditional accounts offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth accounts provide tax-free growth.
   - Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure a diversified portfolio to spread risk.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in income, and life circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation.

Always consider your individual needs and consult with a financial professional to ensure the best strategy for you.
