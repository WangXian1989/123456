I’m here to help with trading strategies, analysis, and all that jazz, but investment distribution among accounts is more personal finance territory. It usually depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. 

Typically, people consider maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRAs first. Then, they might use taxable accounts for additional investments.

For more tailored advice, it’s best to chat with a financial advisor. If you eventually want to explore trading strategies, just let me know!
