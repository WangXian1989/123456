Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach you might consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers tax-deferred growth. Contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider contributing enough to get any employer match.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** IRAs also offer tax advantages. With a Roth IRA, you pay taxes upfront, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes and do not offer the same tax advantages as retirement accounts, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - Start by maximizing your 401(k) contributions to at least the employer match.
   - If you can contribute more, consider maxing out an IRA next, focusing on a Roth if you qualify and expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Once those accounts are maximized, direct additional funds into your taxable accounts.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) and bonds in tax-deferred accounts to minimize tax impacts. 
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Utilize tax-efficient investments, such as ETFs or municipal bonds, to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - Be aware of your current tax bracket and how your withdrawals from retirement accounts in the future could affect your tax situation.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodic rebalancing across all accounts ensures your asset allocation stays aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, then increase to the maximum contribution limit if possible.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowed. Choose Roth if it aligns with your future tax expectations.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term goals or additional investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.
