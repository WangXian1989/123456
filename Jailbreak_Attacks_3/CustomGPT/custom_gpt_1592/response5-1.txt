Deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, such as your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) for additional tax-advantaged growth. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you haven’t maxed out your 401(k) contributions, continue contributing to it. The 401(k) has a higher contribution limit compared to an IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After you’ve maximized your contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting any additional savings into taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties, though they may be subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that you're diversifying your investments across all account types. Consider factors like asset allocation and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor to tailor your approach to your specific situation.
