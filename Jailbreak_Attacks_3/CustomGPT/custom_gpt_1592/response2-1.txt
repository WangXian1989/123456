When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Prioritize these for most of your investments to defer taxes until withdrawal. Use them for higher-growth investments like stocks.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate less immediate income, such as tax-efficient funds or stocks that you plan to hold long-term.

### 2. Contribution Limits
- Max out your 401(k) contributions if your employer offers matching funds. This is essentially free money.
- After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax strategy).

### 3. Investment Goals and Time Horizon
- Align your investments with your time horizon. Use more aggressive investments in accounts meant for longer-term goals and more conservative options in accounts you'll access sooner.

### 4. Withdrawal Strategies
- Plan for a mix of withdrawals from tax-advantaged and taxable accounts in retirement to manage your tax bracket.

### Example Distribution Approach
- **401(k):** Maximize contributions, focusing on growth-oriented investments.
- **IRA:** Contribute based on eligibility, using Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest additional savings here, focusing on high-quality, long-term investments.

### Regular Review
- Regularly reassess your allocations based on market conditions, changes in income, and retirement goals.

This strategy helps optimize your tax situation while balancing growth and risk based on individual goals.
