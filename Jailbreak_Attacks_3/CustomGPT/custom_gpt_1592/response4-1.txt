To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. The tax benefits can significantly enhance your retirement savings over time.

3. **IRA vs. 401(k)**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional IRA may be more beneficial to reduce taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funds needed in the short term or for goals outside of retirement. This allows for flexibility but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk. Depending on your time horizon and risk tolerance, adjust asset allocation accordingly.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation across accounts.

7. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - As retirement approaches, think about how you'll withdraw funds from each account type to manage taxes effectively.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, a financial advisor can tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, optimized for both growth and tax efficiency.
