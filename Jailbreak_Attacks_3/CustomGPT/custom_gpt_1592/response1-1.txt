To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on maxing out contributions to these accounts first. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s (plus $7,500 if age 50 or older) and $6,500 for IRAs (plus $1,000 if age 50 or older).
   - Choose a traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now; opt for a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Allocate Investments Wisely**:
   - Place high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable assets (like bonds) to take advantage of favorable tax rates on dividends and long-term capital gains.

4. **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: In your taxable account, consider tax-loss harvesting to offset gains with losses, reducing your tax liability.

5. **Regular Review**: Review and adjust your allocations regularly based on market conditions and your changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you have complex financial needs or specific goals, consulting a professional can provide tailored advice.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes your returns while minimizing your tax burden.
