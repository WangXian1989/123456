I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can support liver health.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight, which is crucial for liver health.
   - **Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake can prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Healthcare providers may recommend regular liver function tests to monitor your liver's health.

4. **Management of Underlying Conditions**: Treating related health issues, such as diabetes or high cholesterol, can improve liver health.

5. **Supportive Therapies**: These might include supplements or therapies to improve liver function, but always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new treatment.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, where liver function is critically impaired, a transplant might be necessary.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice based on your condition.
