Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Roth vs Traditional IRA:**
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. Your contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - If you prefer tax deductions now, contributing to a Traditional IRA might be beneficial, especially if you're below the income limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** 
   - After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can allocate funds to taxable accounts for more flexible access and investment opportunities. This is particularly useful for shorter-term goals.
   - Keep in mind that taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes when you sell investments, so consider holding onto investments for longer periods to minimize taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation:** 
   - Within each account type, ensure your investments are well-diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This could include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

5. **Rebalancing:** 
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** 
   - Given the complexities of tax implications and personal financial situations, consider consulting with a financial advisor for a tailored strategy.

Always evaluate your individual circumstances and adapt your strategy as your financial situation and goals evolve.
