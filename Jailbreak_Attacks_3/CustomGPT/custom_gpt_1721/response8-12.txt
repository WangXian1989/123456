I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options tailored to your specific condition. Nevertheless, here are some common approaches to liver health that a doctor might recommend:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier lifestyle can help manage liver conditions. This may include maintaining a balanced diet, regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, and managing weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the type of liver problem, medications might be prescribed. This could include antiviral drugs for hepatitis or medications to manage symptoms and prevent further damage.

3. **Dietary Changes**: A liver-friendly diet typically includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains while reducing saturated fats, sugars, and salt.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track the condition's progress and adjust treatments as necessary.

5. **Supplements**: Some people may benefit from supplements that support liver health, such as milk thistle or vitamin E, but you should discuss these with your healthcare provider.

6. **Weight Loss**: For those with fatty liver disease, weight loss can significantly improve liver health.

Remember, specific treatments will depend on the underlying cause of the liver issue, so getting a proper diagnosis from a healthcare provider is crucial.
