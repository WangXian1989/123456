Allocating your funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's free money!

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, consider opening a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. If you're eligible, contributing to a Roth IRA can be beneficial since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Prioritize the 401(k)**: After the IRA, go back to your 401(k) and max it out if possible. It often has higher contribution limits than an IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Choose investments with favorable tax treatments, like index funds or ETFs, which can minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your assets are diversified across accounts. This helps manage risk and take advantage of different tax treatments.

6. **Continuous Evaluation**: Periodically review your contribution strategy based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, and tax laws.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that suits your specific circumstances.
