When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider factors like tax implications, your retirement goals, investment options, and your current financial situation. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA, especially a Roth IRA if you qualify. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement and provide flexibility.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: Remember that 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are tax-deferred accounts, meaning you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Taxable accounts do not have special contribution limits or tax advantages but can be beneficial for accessing funds prior to retirement age without penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) in each type of account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you're further from retirement, you may want to take a growth-oriented approach (higher risk) in your 401(k) and IRA, while keeping more stable investments in your taxable account for liquidity.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so it's wise to reassess how you're distributing your contributions on a regular basis, especially as you get closer to retirement.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Financial advisors can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances, including tax implications and investment strategies.

Always make sure to stay informed and adjust your contributions as needed, ensuring a balanced approach tailored to your individual retirement goals.
