Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing this out next, especially if you can make pre-tax contributions. This lowers your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you’re eligible for a Traditional or Roth IRA, try to fund this account as well. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds beyond retirement contributions. This offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, although you might face capital gains tax.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while holding lower-yield, more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically to ensure they still align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
