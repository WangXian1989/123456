When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some key points to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Often offers employer matching, pre-tax contributions reduce taxable income, and grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free. Choose based on your current vs. future tax expectations.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are taxed on realized gains, interest, and dividends, giving flexibility for withdrawals but also requiring tax management.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Benefits**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match.

### 3. **Assess Tax Considerations**
   - Consider contributing to tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA) for maximum tax benefits.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate long-term gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### 4. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Maintain a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
   - Adjust asset allocation based on account type; for example, hold bond funds in tax-advantaged accounts to defer interest income.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement, considering tax implications and required minimum distributions (RMDs) for 401(k)s and traditional IRAs.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and goals.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max out 401(k) contributions** (up to the match).
2. **Contribute to an IRA**, especially if you are eligible for tax deductions.
3. **Invest in taxable accounts** for additional savings beyond the limits of tax-deferred accounts.

### Conclusion
Each personâ€™s situation is unique, so it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
