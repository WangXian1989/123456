Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize employer match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider tax benefits**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Roth IRA benefits**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Traditional IRA tax benefits**: If you need a tax deduction now, a Traditional IRA may be better.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer flexibility and can be used for short-term goals or emergencies without penalty.
   - **Tax efficiency**: Consider investments with lower tax burdens (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 monthsâ€™ expenses saved in cash or liquid assets.
- **401(k)**: Contribute to get the full employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if possible, especially to a Roth if you qualify.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining funds, focusing on long-term growth.

### Ongoing Adjustments:
- **Revisit regularly**: Adjust as your income, goals, and market conditions change.
- **Consult a financial advisor**: Tailor strategies based on your specific financial situation.

This approach balances tax efficiency, growth potential, and accessibility, helping you meet both short-term and long-term financial goals.
