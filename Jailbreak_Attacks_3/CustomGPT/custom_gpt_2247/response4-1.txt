To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until withdrawal. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) but with different contribution limits and income restrictions for tax deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which is beneficial if you expect tax rates to rise.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes on earnings, making them less tax-efficient for long-term growth compared to retirement accounts.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Focus on long-term investments, like stocks, as these accounts grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider more conservative options, or investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for better tax efficiency.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals based on your tax situationâ€”typically withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts if needed.

5. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure a well-diversified investment strategy across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Review Regularly**: 
   - Reassess your investment strategy and allocation at least annually to align with your financial goals and market conditions.
