Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Traditional Tax Accounts**: Contributions may reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: While contributions are made post-tax, qualified withdrawals are tax-free, making them great for tax diversification.

### 3. **Balance and Diversification**
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio in each account that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - You can invest more aggressively in taxable accounts since capital gains taxes would apply only when you sell investments.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize tax impact. Typically, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

### 5. **Annual Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and aim to maximize contributions where it makes sense for your situation.

### 6. **Revisit Regularly**
   - Review your asset allocation and adjust your contributions based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals.

### Conclusion
A tailored approach that considers your unique financial situation, life stage, and retirement goals will yield the best results. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies.
