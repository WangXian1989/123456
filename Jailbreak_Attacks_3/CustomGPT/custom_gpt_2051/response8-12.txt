I'm really sorry to hear that you're dealing with liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice, but I can outline some general treatment options often considered for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while avoiding alcohol and excessive fats.
   - **Weight Management**: Losing weight if overweight can significantly help liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis (like hepatitis B or C).
   - **Immunosuppressants**: For autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups with blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some herbs and supplements may support liver health, but discuss these with a doctor first.

Always consult a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific condition. They can provide tailored advice and monitor your progress effectively.
