Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you’re over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Contribution limits for 2024 are $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50+). Choose based on whether you prefer tax-deferred growth (traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth).

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first for long-term growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate short-term capital gains or interest income, which are taxed at your ordinary income rate.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio in all accounts. Think about asset allocation and rebalancing periodically.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you will withdraw funds in retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailor your strategy to your unique financial situation; consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Always keep an eye on your overall investment goals and adjust your strategy as your situation changes!
