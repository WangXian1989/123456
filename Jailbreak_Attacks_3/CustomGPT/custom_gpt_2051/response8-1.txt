Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.” Aim for the contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals. A traditional IRA can also be beneficial for tax deductions.

### 2. **Strategic Tax Management**
   - **Debt and Tax Considerations**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts. If you anticipate being in a lower bracket, traditional accounts may be more suitable.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for shorter-term goals or for flexibility. Keep investments that generate less taxable income (like growth stocks) here.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Based on Goals**
   - **Retirement Accounts**: Generally, hold growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts since they're shielded from capital gains taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs**
   - Ensure a portion of your money is in accessible accounts for emergencies or short-term goals. Typically, taxable accounts provide more liquidity than retirement accounts.

### 5. **Regular Contributions and Rebalancing**
   - Set up automatic contributions to maintain your strategy. Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

### Conclusion
Consult a financial advisor to personalize this strategy further based on your unique situation.
