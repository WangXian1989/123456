To effectively determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

### 1. **Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year, but withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA** (Traditional): Similar to the 401(k) regarding tax implications—tax-deferral until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold and may incur taxes on dividends.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Consider taxable accounts for investments you'll need sooner, as they offer more liquidity.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts which can affect how much you can allocate to those accounts versus taxable accounts. 

### Recommendations for Allocation:
- Maximize employer match in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially “free money.”
- Next, contribute to an IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.
- Finally, invest in taxable accounts for additional growth or liquidity needs.

### Strategy:
- **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying your holdings across different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and ETFs.
- **Rebalance**: Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, particularly as you approach retirement.

Deciding the right allocation will depend on your individual circumstances, including your risk tolerance, retirement timeline, and financial goals. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your unique needs.
