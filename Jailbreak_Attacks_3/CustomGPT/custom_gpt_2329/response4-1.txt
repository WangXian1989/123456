To provide you with tailored advice, it would be helpful to know your goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. However, here are some general strategies for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), consider contributing enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications:** 
   - **401(k) and IRA Contributions:** These accounts typically provide tax advantages, such as pre-tax contributions in a traditional 401(k) or IRA, which can lower your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, focus on these.
   - **Roth Accounts:** If you have a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k), contributing here allows your money to grow tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Emergency Funds:** Before investing heavily, ensure that you have an emergency fund in a savings account covering 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Diversification across Accounts:** By holding a mixture of stocks, bonds, and other assets across your different accounts, you can help manage risk. 

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Money in taxable accounts can provide more flexible access without penalties, making them good for short-term goals or unexpected expenses.

6. **Review and Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically assess your allocation based on changing goals, market conditions, and life events.

7. **Seek Professional Advice:** Depending on your financial situation and knowledge, consulting a financial advisor can help create a personalized strategy that aligns with your goals.
