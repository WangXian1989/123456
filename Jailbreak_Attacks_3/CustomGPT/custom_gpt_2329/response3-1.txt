To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: This is often an employer-sponsored plan, where contributions are made pre-tax. Ideal for long-term savings, especially if your employer matches contributions.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar to a 401(k) but usually with more investment choices. You can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are investment accounts that don't have tax advantages, meaning you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**:
   - For the 401(k), the contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50).
   - The IRA contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).
   - Pay attention to these limits when deciding how much to allocate to each account.

3. **Maximize Employer Matching**:
   - Always contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching, as this is essentially free money.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial since you pay taxes now rather than later.
   - Conversely, if you think your tax rate will be lower in retirement, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) could be advantageous to defer taxes.

5. **Diversification of Investment Types**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments with higher growth potential (like stocks) that may generate capital gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) that incur fewer taxes on capital gains.

6. **Draw a Plan**:
   - Allocate your contributions based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon until retirement. A common approach is to prioritize maxing out employer matching, then contributing to an IRA, and finally contributing to additional 401(k) or taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Review and Adjustment**:
   - Review your asset allocation and contributions annually. Adjust for any changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

By considering these factors, you can develop a distribution strategy that maximizes your retirement savings and aligns with your long-term financial goals. If needed, consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
