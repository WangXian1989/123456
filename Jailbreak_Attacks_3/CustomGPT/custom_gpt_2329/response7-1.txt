Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some guidelines for an effective distribution strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money" and can boost your retirement savings significantly. After contributing to get the match, consider how much you can afford to contribute beyond that limit, keeping in mind the contribution limits set by the IRS.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Maximize contributions to your IRA (either traditional or Roth) next. Traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice between the two should be based on your current versus expected future tax rate.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions in your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can invest in taxable accounts. This is especially useful if you have short-term financial goals or need liquidity since these accounts do not come with the same restrictions as retirement accounts. 

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across various assets (stocks, bonds, real estate) proportionate to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, equities can be more beneficial in tax-advantaged accounts due to their higher growth potential, while bonds may be more appropriate for taxable accounts due to their more favorable tax treatment in those accounts.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of the tax implications of your investments. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income, which can make taxable accounts suitable for dividend-paying stocks and long-term investments.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance, especially after market fluctuations.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor who can analyze your specific situation and assist in creating a tailored strategy.

By carefully balancing contributions and maintaining an organized asset allocation, you can optimize your wealth growth and retirement savings.
