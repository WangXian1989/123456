Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be guided by your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general strategies to consider for each type of account:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits ($20,500 for 2022, plus a $6,500 catch-up contribution if you're 50 or older).
   - **Investment Options**: Choose investments that offer diversification and align with your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth), considering your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,000 per year (plus an additional $1,000 if you're over 50).
   - **Investment Choices**: Since IRAs typically offer a wider range of investment options than 401(k)s, consider using this account for investments you believe will grow significantly.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility and Access**: These accounts offer more flexibility as you can withdraw funds without penalties at any time. Use them for shorter-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize your tax liability from capital gains and dividends.
   - **Diversification**: Balance your overall investment portfolio for risk, considering the assets in your tax-advantaged accounts.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the maximum employer match, then move on to IRAs.
   
2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, maximize contributions to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.

3. **Taxable Account for Additional Savings**: After maximizing your retirement accounts, use a taxable account for any additional savings, focusing on investments that provide capital appreciation and long-term growth.

### Regular Reassessment:
It's essential to regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on changes in income, life circumstances, and market conditions. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to develop a strategy tailored to your specific situation and goals. 

Always evaluate your investment choices in light of your overall financial plan, long-term objectives, and risk tolerance.
