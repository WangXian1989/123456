The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund with 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid account.

2. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax Benefits**: Consider the tax benefits of contributing pre-tax dollars to reduce your taxable income.

3. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide whether a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals) or a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions, taxed on withdrawals) aligns better with your tax strategy and retirement goals.
   - **Annual Limits**: Keep in mind the contribution limits and the income thresholds for each type of IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use a taxable account for investments that you might need access to before retirement, as they offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Invest in tax-efficient vehicles like index funds or ETFs, and consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure your portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. This helps balance risk and potential returns.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and investment performance. Rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Ultimately, the right distribution will depend on your specific financial situation and goals, so it’s wise to evaluate these factors carefully.
