When distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors to optimize your investments:

1. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which can help lower your taxable income. It's ideal to max out your employer's match if available.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions (if eligible), while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Decide based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not offer tax advantages but allow for more flexible access to funds. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains here, as they are taxed at a lower rate.

2. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals. Typically, more aggressive investments might be placed in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax deferral, while more conservative investments might be kept in taxable accounts for easier access.

3. **Emergency Funds**:
   - Ensure to maintain an emergency fund in cash or cash-equivalent accounts outside of your investment accounts to avoid early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

4. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits to 401(k)s and IRAs, which can impact how much you're able to allocate to each account type.

5. **Rebalancing and Review**: Regularly assess your asset allocation across accounts to ensure it aligns with your long-term financial goals.

By strategically distributing your investments based on these considerations, you can optimize your overall tax efficiency and growth potential for your retirement savings.
