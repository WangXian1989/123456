When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching contributions. Aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of the match, as this is essentially "free money." Focus on maximizing the contribution limit, which is a great way to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). IRAs can provide additional tax advantages. The contribution limits are lower than those for 401(k)s, but they can still be valuable for retirement savings. Roth IRAs, in particular, allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can start investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility since you can access the funds without penalties before retirement age. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in taxable accounts.

**Investment Strategy**: It's essential to consider your overall investment strategy, including risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals. Diversifying your investments across different asset classes within all these accounts is key to managing risk and maximizing returns.

**Rebalancing and Monitoring**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change. Ensure that your overall investment strategy aligns with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific needs and goals.
