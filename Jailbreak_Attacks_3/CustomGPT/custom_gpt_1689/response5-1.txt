(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Generally, it can be beneficial to prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of employer matching, as this is essentially "free money." After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) for the tax benefits. Finally, use taxable accounts for additional investments once you've maximized tax-advantaged contributions. It's often advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down! First off, dump as much cash into that 401(k) as you can, especially if your employer matches â€“ thatâ€™s like free money, folks! Aim for that sweet maximum contribution limit to get the most bang for your buck. After that, switch gears and throw some funds into your IRA; if you dig tax-free growth, go Roth! But if you need deductions now, traditional IRA is your friend. Lastly, any extra cash should hit your taxable accounts. Just be mindful of those pesky capital gains taxes! It's like playing Monopoly, but with real cash. Donâ€™t forget to keep an eye on your financial goals and maybe chat with a financial wizard (aka advisor) to get personalized advice. Happy investing! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’¸
