Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, investment preferences, and retirement timeline. Here are some points to consider for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Contribution Limits**: Maximize contributions up to the employer match, if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or post-tax (Roth 401(k)), which can significantly reduce your taxable income.
   - **Investment Choices**: Usually limited to the options provided by the plan, so factor in the quality of these choices.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Consider the annual contribution limits and eligibility for tax deductions.
   - **Flexibility**: IRAs generally offer a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts offer the most flexibility and access to funds without penalties.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when buying and selling investments.
   - **Diversification**: Use taxable accounts for investments that could generate high capital gains, possibly focusing on dividends, which can be taxed at lower rates.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match.
- **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out both retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for growth and liquidity.

### Personal Considerations:
- Adjust this distribution strategy based on your age, risk tolerance, and how soon you expect to need the funds.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation and goals.

Always remember to re-evaluate your allocations regularly as your financial situation and goals may change! ðŸ“ˆ
