Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires a strategic approach that prioritizes tax efficiency, retirement goals, and investment growth. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough** to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money" and a guaranteed return on your investment.
   - **Investment Options**: Select investments that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, maximize contributions here to defer taxes. 
   - **Roth IRA**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider funding your Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in the future. 

### 3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Invest in Tax-Efficient Funds**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: If you need access to funds before retirement, ensure you allocate a portion to your taxable account for flexibility.

### 4. **Review Asset Allocation**
   - **Diversify investments** across all accounts. Maintain a consistent overall asset allocation by balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account according to your risk tolerance.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio to adhere to your investment strategy.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - **Regular Reviews**: Continuously review your financial situation and retirement goals, adjusting your allocations as necessary based on market performance, life changes, or updated objectives.

By following these principles, you can create a well-structured investment portfolio that aligns with both your immediate financial situation and long-term retirement goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
