Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Aim to max out contributions if possible, as 401(k)s have high contribution limits and offer tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**: Depending on your current and expected future tax rates, choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If you're eligible, try to max out your IRA contributions as well.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need earlier than retirement or for goals like buying a home or funding education.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on investments that generate less taxable income, such as index funds or tax-managed funds.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).
   - **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts like 401(k) and traditional IRA will be taxed as ordinary income, so balance withdrawals strategically.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocation periodically to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Depending on your situation, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice to optimize your investment strategy.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced distribution that aligns with your financial goals.
