The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Max out any employer match first, as this is essentially "free money".
   - If you can, contribute up to the annual limit, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as contributions are made with after-tax dollars and withdrawals are tax-free.
   - If you qualify, max out your IRA contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for additional investments once youâ€™ve maxed out retirement accounts.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, which generate fewer taxable events.

### General Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts** (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts.
- Once you meet contribution limits for retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for flexibility.
- Rebalance periodically based on market performance and changing financial goals.

### Considerations:
- Assess your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

This strategy can help optimize your long-term growth while considering tax implications.
