Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a balanced approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth) based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **401(k)**: After employer match, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions if your employer’s plan has low fees and investment options.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. This is good for short- to medium-term goals or for more flexible access to your funds.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to manage risk effectively.

5. **Re-evaluation**: Periodically review your allocations based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
