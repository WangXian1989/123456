Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a helpful approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing the match, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This allows you to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

3. **IRA Contributions:** Next, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility for short-term goals or when you've exhausted tax-advantaged options.

5. **Rebalancing:** Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Consider Tax Implications:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts and the tax treatment of distributions from your 401(k) and IRA.

7. **Financial Goals:** Tailor your strategy based on your timeline (short-term vs. long-term) and risk appetite.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice can further enhance your strategy.
