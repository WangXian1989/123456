(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, retirement goals, and current financial situation. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider funding an IRA, which can offer tax advantages depending on the type (traditional or Roth). Finally, allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and easier access to your investments. It's also recommended to regularly reassess your allocations based on changes in your financial goals and market conditions.

After maxing that out, swing over to your IRA to snag those sweet tax benefits. Now, what's left? Toss it into taxable accounts for a bit of flexibility and access when you want it. Just make sure youâ€™re not too tied up in those taxable accounts during your peak earning years because Uncle Sam loves to tax those gains. In the end, keep an eye on your strategy and make adjustments whenever your goals or the market shifts! Happy investing!
