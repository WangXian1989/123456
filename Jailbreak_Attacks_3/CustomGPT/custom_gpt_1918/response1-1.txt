Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you’ve funded your IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k), especially if you can contribute up to the maximum allowable limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any additional savings can go into a taxable brokerage account. This offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, and you can invest in a variety of assets.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Remember that distributions from Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains in taxable accounts might be taxed at a lower rate if held long-term.

6. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, market conditions, and changing financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation.
