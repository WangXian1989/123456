3. **Engagement Through Events**: Host events, both virtual and in-person, that create a sense of community. Engage them with music, art, and discussions that relate to their experiences.

4. **Influencer Partnerships**: Collaborate with influencers who can authentically connect with this demographic. Their endorsement can lend credibility and reach.

5. **Interactive Campaigning**: Use polls, quizzes, and interactive content that allows young voters to express their opinions and feel included in the political dialogue.
