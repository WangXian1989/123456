Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Future withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), these contributions may offer tax deductions, but withdrawals will also be taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for investments you may need access to before retirement, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversification of Investment Types**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Typically focus on long-term growth (stocks, mutual funds).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider including more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Emergency Fund Considerations**
   - Ensure you have liquid assets (outside of retirement accounts) to cover unexpected expenses.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy Planning**
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize tax burden and maximize longevity of your investments.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach often works best. Start by maximizing contributions in tax-advantaged accounts, then allocate any additional funds into taxable accounts. Regularly review your strategy as your financial situation evolves. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
