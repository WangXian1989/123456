Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high earning potential and a good match, prioritize your 401(k) contributions up to the match limit.
   - **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, use taxable accounts for additional savings. Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxes on capital gains.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: 
   - In lower tax brackets, favor Roth accounts to benefit from tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - In higher brackets, you may want to lean towards Traditional accounts for the upfront tax deduction.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain an emergency fund outside these accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
