Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is effectively “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth options), which lowers your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds) and account types to balance risk and growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Money in taxable accounts can be accessed at any time without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals or emergencies.

5. **Future Taxation**: Consider your expected tax bracket at retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher bracket, favor Roth accounts. If lower, traditional accounts may save you more on taxes.

6. **Age and Retirement Timeline**: Younger investors may focus more on growth (riskier investments), while those closer to retirement might prioritize stability and income.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changing circumstances.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your individual situation.
