Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**

- **401(k) (Employer Match):** Max out contributions to your 401(k) at least up to the employer match. This is essentially free money.
  
- **IRA:** Consider contributing to an IRA, especially if it offers tax advantages. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth, whereas a Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**

- **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions reduce your taxable income in the year they are made (for Traditional accounts). Withdrawals in retirement are taxed at your ordinary income rate.

- **Taxable Accounts:** Capital gains from investments held here are taxed differently, often at lower rates compared to ordinary income. Consider holding investments with a higher chance of appreciation in these accounts.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**

- **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

- **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy in Retirement**

- Plan your withdrawals to minimize taxes. Typically, retirees withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and IRAs), and lastly from tax-free accounts (Roth IRA).

### 5. **Consult a Professional**

- Given the complexities of tax implications and investment strategies, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy to your specific needs.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across different account types, aligning with your financial goals.
