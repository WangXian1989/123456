Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income now. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, consider the tax implications when contributing and withdrawing.
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you’ll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may be more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Build an Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have three to six months' worth of living expenses in a liquid account before heavily investing.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Within each account type, spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

### 5. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After securing the employer match, prioritize contributions to traditional or Roth IRAs, depending on your income and tax situation.

### 6. **Consider Your Investment Timeline**
   - For longer-term goals (like retirement), you might allocate more to equities. For shorter-term goals, consider safer assets.

### 7. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**
   - Periodically review your allocation as your financial situation changes, including income levels, life events, and market conditions.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach focusing on tax-advantaged accounts first, then taxable accounts, can be a strong strategy. It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your individual circumstances.
