The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: Next, consider funding a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA. IRAs often have a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k) plans. Depending on your income, a Roth IRA may be particularly beneficial as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts don’t have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts. However, they provide flexibility for short-term goals. If you have investments with long-term capital gains, consider holding them in taxable accounts to benefit from lower tax rates.

4. **Diversify Your Investments**: Make sure your overall investment strategy is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and return.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your allocations periodically and rebalance as necessary to ensure that your money is distributed according to your current financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

It's essential to tailor your distribution strategy based on your specific circumstances and changing life events.
