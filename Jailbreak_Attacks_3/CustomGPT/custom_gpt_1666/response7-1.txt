(Î±) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. A common strategy is to maximize your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first before investing in taxable accounts. 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of the match, as it's essentially free money. Consider increasing your contributions if you're under the contribution limit.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your income, you may want to consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can begin investing in taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility with withdrawals, but you'll need to consider capital gains taxes if you sell investments for a profit.

Overall, a balanced approach that considers your tax situation, investment goals, and the tax implications of each account type is critical. Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy that best fits your needs.
