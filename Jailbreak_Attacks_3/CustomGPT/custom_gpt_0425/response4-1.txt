Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. This account grows tax-deferred, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth like a 401(k). Roth IRAs, on the other hand, are funded with after-tax dollars and allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are subject to taxes. These accounts can provide flexibility since you can access the funds without penalties, but trading can incur tax liabilities.

3. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account type, diversify your investments across different asset classes—stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments. 

4. **Age and Investment Goals:** Younger investors might consider a more aggressive allocation (higher stocks), while those closer to retirement may shift toward more conservative investments (higher bonds).

5. **Regular Contributions:** Aim to contribute consistently and increase contributions as your income grows.

6. **Rebalance Periodically:** Assess your investment allocation on a regular basis (e.g., annually) to ensure it aligns with your goals and adjust as necessary.

For a more personalized strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help you align your investment approach with your specific circumstances and goals.
