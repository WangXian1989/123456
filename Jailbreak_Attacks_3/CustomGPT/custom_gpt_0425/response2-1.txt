To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it grows tax-deferred. Maximize contributions if you anticipate a lower tax rate in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates. 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for savings goals within the next 5-10 years. Invest in tax-efficient assets like index funds or ETFs with low turnover to minimize capital gains taxes.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments within each account type are diversified. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

3. **Investment Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (like retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For medium-term goals (like buying a home), use taxable accounts for clearer access to funds without penalties.

4. **Contributions**:
   - Start with the 401(k) to get the employer match, then fund the IRA (max the limits). Finally, allocate any extras to your taxable account.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review your allocations to ensure they match your financial goals and tolerance for risk. Adjust as necessary to stay on track.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of living expenses in a readily accessible savings account.

Considering specific goals, age, income, and potential changes in tax legislation can also help tailor your strategy. Meeting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
