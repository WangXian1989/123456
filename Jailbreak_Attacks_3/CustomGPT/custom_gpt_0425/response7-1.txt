Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 2. Understand Tax Implications
- **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes, which can affect your returns.

### 3. Diversify Investments
- Allocate investments across all accounts, focusing on a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes. You can use tax-efficient investments in your taxable accounts and hold less tax-efficient options (like bonds) in retirement accounts.

### 4. Consider Withdrawals
- Plan for your withdrawal strategy later on. Generally, it's wise to draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### Example Distribution
- **50% 401(k) contribution** (up to employer match)
- **25% IRA contribution**
- **25% Taxable account** (once 401(k) and IRA are maxed out)

### Regularly Review
- Revisit your strategy annually to adjust for changes in income, tax laws, and market conditions.
