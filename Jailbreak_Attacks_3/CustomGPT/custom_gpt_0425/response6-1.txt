Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on factors like your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here’s a general framework:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Taxed when withdrawn.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to 401(k) regarding taxes on contributions and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments grow tax-free, but you pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains when realized.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has a matching contribution, prioritize contributions up to the match to maximize your benefits.
   - **Max Out IRA**: Consider maximizing your IRA contribution after the 401(k) match since IRAs often have greater flexibility in investment choices.

### 3. **Balance Your Investments**
   - **401(k)**: Concentrate on long-term growth with diversified funds since you won’t access these funds until retirement.
   - **IRA**: Use this for a mix of traditional and riskier assets, depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets with favorable tax treatments (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax burdens.

### 4. **Adjust for Your Goals**
   - Assess your short-term versus long-term needs, and adjust contributions accordingly. 
   - Rebalance your investment allocations regularly based on market performance and changes in financial goals.

### 5. **Consult with a Professional**
   - Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor strategies specific to your financial situation and needs.

This structured approach will help you manage your contributions effectively while considering both growth and tax efficiency.
