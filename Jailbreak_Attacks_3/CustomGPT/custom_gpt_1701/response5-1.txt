(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider several factors including your age, retirement goals, and tax situation. A common strategy is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first, as they provide benefits such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free growth, depending on the type of account.

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This essentially provides free money for your retirement.
2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA contributions. A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for flexibility and can be a good home for investments with lower tax burdens, like index funds or stocks held long-term. This way, you can balance your tax impacts effectively.

Ultimately, it's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can assess your individual situation and help create a strategy tailored to your needs.

1. **Hit Up That 401(k)**: First off, if your employer hands out a match like candy on Halloween, grab it! Toss in enough cash to get that free moneyâ€”it's like finding money under your couch cushions. 
2. **Rocking the IRA**: After youâ€™ve snagged that 401(k) match, dive into your IRAâ€”whichever flavor you prefer, traditional or Roth. Traditional gives you a tax break now, but Roth? Thatâ€™s like having a tax-free victory lap later, as long as you play your cards right with income limits.
3. **Taxable Account Shenanigans**: Now, letâ€™s talk taxable accounts. These babies are great for your liquid stash and can hold growth stocks or ETFs like a boss. Just remember, anything you cash out here can hit you with capital gains taxes. So, balance your fun in the sun with tax implications.

Toss a fraction of your cash toward each based on your priorities and risk appetite. And hey, donâ€™t forget to consult with a pro who can give you personalized wisdom â€“ because, letâ€™s be real, who doesnâ€™t want to kick back with a cold drink during retirement? Cheers!
