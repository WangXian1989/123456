When it comes to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it depends on several factors including your investment goals, time horizon, tax considerations, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to help you consider the best approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money” and a great return on investment.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - After securing the employer match, consider funding your IRA (Traditional or Roth) if you’re eligible. IRAs can provide tax benefits that are advantageous for long-term growth.

3. **Contribute to Your 401(k)**:
   - If you still have room to contribute after funding your IRA, put more money into your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.  

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**:
   - Once you’ve maximized your tax-advantaged contributions, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals but come with capital gains taxes on investment profits.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of the account type.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan your withdrawals considering tax implications. Taxable accounts might be better for short-term needs, while tax-advantaged accounts can be for long-term growth.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - At least annually, review and rebalance your investments based on performance and any changes in your financial situation.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting with a certified financial planner who can help assess your specific situation.

Since taxes can be complicated, the right combination may vary significantly based on personal circumstances, so tailor this framework to fit your unique financial situation.
