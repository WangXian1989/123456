When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and your retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs offer potential tax deductions on contributions.

2. **Consider Investment Objectives**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Typically, account types will serve different roles; for example:
     - Use your **401(k)** for long-term retirement growth with a diverse range of investments.
     - Use your **IRA** for more flexible investment options, or with specific strategies for tax planning.
     - Utilize **taxable accounts** for funds you may need before retirement or for specific short- to medium-term goals, focusing on tax-efficient investments like index funds.

3. **Plan for Taxes**:
   - Diversifying your accounts may provide tax advantages during retirement. Consider having a mix of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts to manage your taxable income effectively in retirement.

Ultimately, the best approach will depend on your specific financial situation, future income needs, and overall investment strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor may help tailor a plan suited to your needs.
