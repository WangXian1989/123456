To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching funds first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: High contribution limits and potential for employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions, depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Investment Choices**: Choose investments based on your risk tolerance. Typically, you may want higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. This may also be a good place for short-term goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your portfolio periodically based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your distribution strategy with your retirement timeline and financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and needs.
