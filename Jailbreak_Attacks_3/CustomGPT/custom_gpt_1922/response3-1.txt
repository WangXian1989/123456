Distributing your money effectively between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to obtain any employer match – this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k) for contributions, but check the income limits for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Here, you pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, but you have more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investments.

3. **Prioritize Based on Goals**: If your goal is retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. If you want to save for a shorter-term goal, allocate more to taxable accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider what investments you hold in each account. Generally, put higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax impact, and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance as Needed**: Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For tailored advice specific to your financial situation, consider consulting a financial planner who can provide insights based on current taxation laws and your individual circumstances.

By strategically distributing your investments among these accounts, you can optimize your retirement savings while also considering tax implications.
