When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy will depend on several factors like your current income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment timeframe. Here's a general approach to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into other accounts. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If you're eligible for a traditional 401(k), it's a great way to reduce your taxable income now. If eligible, consider a Roth 401(k) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA:** If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it's beneficial for tax-free withdrawals. If a traditional IRA is your option, you can also benefit from tax-deferred growth.

3. **Consider Contributions Limits:** Be aware of contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. In 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50 or older), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older).

4. **Diversify with Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing your contributions to retirement accounts, consider putting additional money into taxable accounts for flexibility. They allow for easy access to funds without penalties.

5. **Tax Implications:** Understand the tax implications of selling investments in your taxable account. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income.

6. **Review Regularly:** Situations change, so revisit your allocations and adjust as necessary based on market conditions, personal circumstances, and changes in goals.

7. **Consult a Professional:** For personalized advice, consider working with a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy based on your individual situation.

Remember to consider your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance in each account. For concrete steps or personalized plans, consulting with a financial planner would be beneficial.
