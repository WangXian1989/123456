(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first, such as maxing out your employer's 401(k) match if available, as this is essentially free money. After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA), you can consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and liquidity. An ideal distribution strategy would typically look like this: contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the match, then fund your IRA, and finally allocate any remaining funds to your taxable accounts.
