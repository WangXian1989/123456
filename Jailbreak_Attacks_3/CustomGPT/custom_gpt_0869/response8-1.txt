To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:** If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before allocating money to other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Typically, it's best to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs before investing in taxable accounts. This can help reduce your taxable income now and grow your investments tax-deferred.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits:** Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for each type of account:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older for 2023)
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older for 2023)

4. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy:** Plan your withdrawals in retirement strategically. Money in a taxable account can be withdrawn without penalties, while retirement accounts may have penalties if accessed before age 59Â½.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Review and rebalance your asset allocation periodically to ensure it meets your long-term goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you're unsure about the best strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation.

By following these principles, you can optimize your investment strategy across different account types.
