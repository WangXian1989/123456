The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k):**
   - Maximize contributions, especially if there's an employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider your investment options within the plan, focusing on diversified mutual funds or index funds.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - Aim to contribute to an IRA if you can, taking advantage of tax benefits.
   - For a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible; for a Roth IRA, withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for investments that may not benefit from tax-advantaged accounts, such as short-term trading.
   - Consider municipal bonds or index funds, which typically have lower tax implications.

### Allocation Strategy:
- **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust the allocation based on your risk tolerance. More aggressive investments can be placed in accounts with longer time horizons.
- **Time Horizon:** Funds expected for short-term use should be in taxable accounts for easier access.
- **Tax Considerations:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments. Hold bonds or interest-paying assets in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

### Example Allocation:
- **Contribute to 401(k):** 15% of income, maximizing employer match.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Max out contributions each year.
- **Taxable Account:** Allocate remaining funds based on cash flow needs and investment goals.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
