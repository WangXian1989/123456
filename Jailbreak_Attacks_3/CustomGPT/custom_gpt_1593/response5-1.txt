(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your overall financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Generally, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it is essentially free money.
  
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Once youâ€™ve taken full advantage of your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, based on your eligibility and tax strategy.

3. **Fund the 401(k)**: After maxing out the IRA, go back to the 401(k) to maximize your contributions. This can also provide tax advantages, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. This is especially useful for short-term goals or if you need access to your funds before retirement.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider the types of investments in each account. For example, you might want to hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable accounts where the long-term capital gains tax may apply.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's cut to the chase! Hereâ€™s a no-nonsense approach to spreading your cash around like peanut butter on toast:

1. **Get That Free Money**: First off, if your employer's 401(k) is throwing in match contributions, grab that like it's a hot deal! Max it out to snag every penny theyâ€™ll pitch in.

2. **Rock an IRA**: Next up, throw some cash into an IRA (Roth or traditional, depending on your vibe and tax situation). Itâ€™s a solid way to pack money away and let it grow like a weed (the good kind).

3. **Double Down on the 401(k)**: Once youâ€™ve milked your IRA, go back to the 401(k) and pump it up. Seriously, get that tax break wherever you can.

4. **Taxable Accounts Are Your Playground**: Finally, dump any leftover bucks into a taxable account for liquidity. Like, when you wanna cash out early, those funds are sitting pretty and ready to roll.

5. **Mix Your Investments**: Donâ€™t forget about the type of assets you stack in each accountâ€”think about pumping stocks in your taxable accounts and keeping your bonds tucked in the tax-sheltered ones.

Always remember, everyone's financial goals are different. Hit up a financial advisor to craft a plan that fits your unique style!
