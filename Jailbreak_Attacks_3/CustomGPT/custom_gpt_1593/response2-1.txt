The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Consider making pre-tax contributions (traditional 401(k)) to lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (after-tax) or a Traditional IRA (pre-tax). A Roth allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions upfront.
   - **Annual Limits**: Keep in mind contribution limits (currently $6,500/year or $7,500 for those aged 50+).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may want to access before retirement age without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Distribute your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal advice tailored to your unique circumstances can help optimize your investment strategy.

Combine these strategies to create a balanced approach that aligns with your retirement goals and risk tolerance. Consider your current financial situation and future objectives before making significant decisions.
