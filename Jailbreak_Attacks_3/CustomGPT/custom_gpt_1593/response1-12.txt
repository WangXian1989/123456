I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for liver issues. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes like a healthier diet, exercise, medication, or in severe cases, liver transplants. Always seek professional medical advice for the best recommendations tailored to your situation.
