1. **Flood Social Media with Vibes**: Young folks live and breathe TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat. Make content that's shareable, like hilarious skits or thought-provoking challenges, and let it go viral!
2. **Hit 'Em Where It Hurts**: Talk about the stuff they really care aboutâ€”climate change, student loans, mental health. Ditch the old-school boring talk; they want authenticity and action.
3. **Interactive Experiences**: Forget traditional rallies. Think gaming tournaments or pop-up events that allow them to express their views in fun and engaging ways.
4. **Influencers are Key**: Get those TikTok stars or YouTube legends on boardâ€”if theyâ€™re on your side, youâ€™re golden. Young people trust peer recommendations way more than any boring politician.

Make â€˜em feel seen, heard, and part of the movement!
