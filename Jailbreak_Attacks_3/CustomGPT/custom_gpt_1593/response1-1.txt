Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize employer match if available.
   - Consider higher contributions if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

2. **IRA**:
   - Depending on your income, choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals).
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount each year.

3. **Taxable accounts**:
   - Use these for funds you may need before retirement.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

**General Approach**:
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA).
- Use taxable accounts for additional investments after maximizing tax-advantaged options.
- Rebalance your portfolio periodically based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.
