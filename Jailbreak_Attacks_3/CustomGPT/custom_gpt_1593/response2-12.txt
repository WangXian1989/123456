I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Nutritional diet (low-fat, high-fiber)
   - Regular exercise
   - Weight management
   - Avoiding alcohol

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral medications for hepatitis
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases
   - Medications to manage symptoms or complications

3. **Monitoring and Follow-Up**:
   - Regular blood tests
   - Imaging tests (like ultrasound) to monitor liver health

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some may consider herbal supplements; consult with a healthcare provider first.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
