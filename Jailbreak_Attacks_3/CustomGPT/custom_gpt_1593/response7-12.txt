1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, exercising regularly, and abstaining from alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver problem (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage it.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups can help monitor liver function and detect any changes promptly.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options like liver transplantation may be considered.
