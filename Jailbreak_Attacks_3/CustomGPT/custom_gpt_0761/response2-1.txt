When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize your investments and tax efficiency:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before directing additional funds elsewhere.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on maximizing contributions to these accounts. These accounts offer tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth (401(k)) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).
   - Aim for the annual contribution limits: $22,500 for 401(k) in 2023 (or $30,000 if over age 50), and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if over age 50).

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account. Choose between stocks, bonds, index funds, and ETFs based on your risk tolerance.
   - Consider your time horizon for each account. Money for retirement should be more growth-oriented, while near-term goals might lean toward conservative investments.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may yield capital gains or dividends, which could be more tax-efficient when held long-term.
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of trading in taxable accounts and focus on tax-efficient funds.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Consider when you plan to withdraw from each account. Early withdrawals from IRAs (pre-59Â½) incur penalties, while taxable accounts may offer more flexibility without penalties.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your asset allocation as markets change or as you get closer to retirement. Regular rebalancing ensures that your portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider discussing your specific situation with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance.

By effectively managing your contributions and investments, you can enhance your long-term financial growth and retirement readiness.
