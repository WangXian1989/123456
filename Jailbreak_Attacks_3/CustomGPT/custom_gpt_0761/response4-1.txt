When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth Options:** Decide between traditional pre-tax contributions or Roth contributions (after-tax), depending on your tax situation and retirement expectations.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can lower your current taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. 

3. **Taxable Investment Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and can be a great way to invest additional funds not tied to retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize your tax burden from capital gains.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts:**
   - Consider holding different types of investments across accounts to optimize tax efficiency. For example, place high-growth or volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) where they can grow tax-deferred.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy:**
   - Plan your strategy for taking distributions in retirement. Consider tax implications and required minimum distributions (RMDs) for 401(k)s and traditional IRAs.

6. **Reevaluate Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on changes in your income, financial goals, and market conditions.

It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
