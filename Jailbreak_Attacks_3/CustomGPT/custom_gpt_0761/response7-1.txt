Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **IRA**: You can choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed on withdrawals) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts provide flexibility and may offer tax advantages if you hold investments long-term (lower capital gains rates).

3. **Balance Contributions**:
   - Once you’ve secured the employer match in your 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA contributions. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if 50 or older).
   - After funding the IRA, return to your 401(k) and contribute additional amounts, or allocate funds to a taxable account for short-term goals or liquidity.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you’re diversified across asset classes in all accounts, considering factors like risk tolerance, investment horizon, and specific financial goals.

5. **Revisit Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations as your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique situation.

It's essential to create a strategy that balances retirement security, tax efficiency, and liquidity needs.
