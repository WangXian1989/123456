To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your IRA (Traditional or Roth) after maximizing any employer match in your 401(k). 
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexible Needs**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This flexibility can help fund goals outside of retirement.

5. **Invest Based on Time Horizon**: Allocate investments based on your timeline. Longer horizons (e.g., retirement) can afford more risk, whereas shorter timelines should focus on stability.

6. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Balance your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) according to your risk tolerance and goal timeline. 

7. **Revisit and Adjust**: Regularly review your account distributions based on performance, life changes, or goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
