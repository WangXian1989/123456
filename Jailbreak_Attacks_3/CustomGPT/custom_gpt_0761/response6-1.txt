To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to either a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth), depending on your income level and tax bracket.
  
### 2. **Consider Your Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts where growth can compound tax-free.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Utilize taxable accounts for investments you may need to access sooner, as these can be more liquid.

### 3. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-yield dividends) in these accounts to defer taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for favorable tax treatment.

### 4. **Review Tax Implications Regularly**
   - Assess your overall tax situation annually and adjust contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

By balancing contributions and investments across these accounts wisely, you can optimize your tax efficiency and enhance your future financial security.
