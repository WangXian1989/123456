To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, then increase contributions to reach the annual limit. This offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. This provides additional tax advantages, depending on your income.

### 2. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts as Needed**
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Use taxable accounts for short-term financial goals or emergencies.
   - **Investment Vehicle**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Assess Investment Goals**
   - **Long-term vs. Short-term**: Use retirement accounts for long-term investments and taxable accounts for more flexible strategies.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust Regularly**
   - **Periodic Reviews**: Assess asset allocation and performance regularly, making adjustments based on market conditions and life changes.

By prioritizing tax advantages and aligning your investment strategy with your financial goals, you can maximize your overall returns.
