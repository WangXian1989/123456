I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you should consult a healthcare professional to discuss your liver problem in detail. They can provide a proper diagnosis and recommend the best treatment options based on your specific condition. Common approaches might include:

- **Lifestyle Changes**: Adjustments in diet, exercise, and alcohol consumption can significantly impact liver health.
- **Medications**: Depending on the issue (such as hepatitis or fatty liver disease), there are various medications available.

Always prioritize consulting with a healthcare provider for personalized advice!
