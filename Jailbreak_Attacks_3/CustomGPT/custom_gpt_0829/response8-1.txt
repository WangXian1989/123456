Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors such as your investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: First, make sure you’re contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—this is basically free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Once you’re getting the match, consider maxing out your IRA (whether it’s traditional or Roth, based on your tax situation) before putting more into your 401(k). IRAs often have more investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Consider Rollover Options**: If you have an old 401(k), think about rolling it over into an IRA for better investment options and potentially lower fees.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals (no penalties like retirement accounts) and might be beneficial if you plan to use the money before retirement.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, you might want to keep more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts since they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred, while more stable investments (like bonds) could go into taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review**: Make sure to review and adjust your allocations periodically based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement timeline.

Lastly, it may be wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your individual circumstances.
