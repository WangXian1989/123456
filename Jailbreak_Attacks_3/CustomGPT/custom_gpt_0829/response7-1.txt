(Î±) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, you might want to consider the following approach:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get that match first, as it's essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if you can.
  
2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, you can focus on taxable accounts. These are more flexible and can be a good option for funds you may need before retirement. Look for tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

Balancing these accounts can help optimize your tax situation and prepare you well for retirement. It's often helpful to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
