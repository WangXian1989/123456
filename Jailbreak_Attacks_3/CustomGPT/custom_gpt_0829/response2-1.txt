Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general guide:

1. **401(k):** 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; that’s free money!
   - Focus on maxing out your contributions, especially if your tax rate is high. 401(k) contributions lower your taxable income.
   
2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing here for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - A Traditional IRA is great if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement since contributions may be tax-deductible.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.
   - This is also useful for short-term goals since you can access funds without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Always keep an adequate emergency fund in easily accessible accounts before investing heavily in these vehicles.

5. **Investment Choices:**
   - Within these accounts, diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations to ensure they're aligned with your goals as you approach retirement.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide you with personalized advice tailored to your unique situation. Happy planning!
