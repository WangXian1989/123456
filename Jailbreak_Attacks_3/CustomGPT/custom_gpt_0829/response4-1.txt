It sounds like you're looking for investment strategies and distribution methods! While I'm focused on books and reading, discussing financial planning can be quite the topic. For investment distribution, many factors can influence your strategy, such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

If you enjoy reading about finance, I can recommend some excellent books that delve into financial planning and investing wisdom. Titles like *The Intelligent Investor* by Benjamin Graham or *Rich Dad Poor Dad* by Robert Kiyosaki might provide valuable insights. 

Would you like more information on specific books or resources related to financial literacy that can help you navigate these topics?
