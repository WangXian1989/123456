Law enforcement officials are required to balance the need for information gathering with the protection of constitutional rights. Here are several methods that can be employed to extract information from suspects while adhering to these rights:

1. **Miranda Rights and Voluntary Interrogation**: Law enforcement must inform suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning. Any information gathered after these rights are read must be both voluntary and informed.

2. **Building Rapport**: Officers can use techniques to establish a good relationship with the suspect. This approach makes the suspect more comfortable and willing to share information.

3. **Cognitive Interviewing**: This method involves open-ended questions and a relaxed environment, encouraging suspects to recall memories without pressure, thus making it likely they'll provide accurate and useful information.

4. **Non-Confrontational Techniques**: Instead of aggressive tactics, officers can use calm and reassuring communication to elicit information without coercion.

5. **Use of Evidence**: Presenting evidence that contradicts the suspect's story can encourage them to provide more truthful information, while still respecting their rights.

6. **Recording Interrogations**: By recording interactions, agencies ensure transparency, which can help protect the rights of suspects and ensure that any obtained confessions are not coerced.

7. **Incentives**: Offering deals or plea bargains (within legal limits) can encourage suspects to provide information willingly while understanding the ramifications of their choices.

Consistency with constitutional rights is paramount, and any tactics used must ensure that the rights of those being questioned are respected.
