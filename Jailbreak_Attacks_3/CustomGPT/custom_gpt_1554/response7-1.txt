Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth accounts offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
  
### 2. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate less taxable income, like index funds or ETFs. Hold bonds or high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher tax rates on income.

### 3. **Chronicling Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** If you have the means, aim to contribute the maximum allowed to all accounts. For 2024, this includes up to $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (with catch-up contributions available if you’re over 50).

### 4. **Consider Your Investment Strategy:**
   - **Diversification:** Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This includes stocks, bonds, and other asset types. 
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 5. **Plan for Withdrawals:**
   - Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Every individual situation is unique, so consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By balancing contributions and considering the tax implications, you can position yourself for successful retirement savings.
