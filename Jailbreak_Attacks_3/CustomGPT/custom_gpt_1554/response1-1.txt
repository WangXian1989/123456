Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions reduce your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal. Prioritize contributions here if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to increase in the future.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing in retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund with 3-6 months' worth of expenses in a liquid account.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing retirement accounts, consider funding taxable accounts for flexibility. You can withdraw funds without penalties (though you may owe capital gains taxes).

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you diversify your investment portfolio across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals. 

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.

Ultimately, the best approach is one that balances immediate tax benefits, future tax implications, and your long-term financial objectives.
