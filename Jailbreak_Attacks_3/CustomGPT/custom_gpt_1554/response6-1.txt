To optimize your money distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money). Aim for the maximum contribution limit if you can afford it.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer a traditional IRA, consider how it fits your tax situation.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Investment Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments that may incur capital gains taxes if sold. This gives you more access to funds without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider low-turnover index funds or tax-managed funds to minimize tax liability.

### 3. **Portfolio Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your goals, risk appetite, and market conditions.

### 4. **Considerations for Withdrawals**
   - **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan how and when youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first may reduce overall tax burden.

By focusing on these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth while minimizing tax impacts over time. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your situation.
