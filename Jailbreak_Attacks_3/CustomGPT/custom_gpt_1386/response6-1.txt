The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. Tax Benefits:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This is beneficial if you're currently in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax benefits if contributions are tax-deductible. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Income from investments (like dividends and capital gains) in these accounts is taxable, but they offer flexibility with withdrawals.

### 2. Investment Goals:
   - **Long-term growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term investments to maximize growth.
   - **Short-term needs**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for easy access to funds without penalties.

### 3. Contribution Limits:
   - **401(k)**: Higher contribution limits compared to IRAs. Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: Consider your eligibility for Roth vs. Traditional based on income.

### 4. Diversification:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts to balance risks and returns effectively.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to obtain any employer match.
- **Contribute to IRA**: Use a Roth IRA if eligible, otherwise opt for a Traditional IRA for tax advantages.
- **Fund Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional amounts in taxable accounts after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### Example Distribution:
1. **401(k)**: 50% of total investment contributions.
2. **IRA**: 30% of total investment contributions.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: 20% of total investment contributions.

### Review Regularly:
- Reassess your distribution based on changes in your income, tax laws, and financial goals.
