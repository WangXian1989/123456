Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Match Potential**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if one is offered; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax vs. After-Tax**: Decide if you want to contribute pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth) based on your expected tax rate during retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, or tax-free growth if it's a Roth IRA. Consider maxing out your contributions if you're eligible.
   - **Investment Options**: IRAs often offer a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k) accounts.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more accessibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize hit from capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first.
- **Contribute to IRA**: If possible, maximize IRA contributions next.
- **Fund Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate to taxable accounts for additional savings or investment growth.

### Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate emergency fund for unexpected expenses.
- **Diversification**: Ensure you have a balanced investment strategy across all accounts.
- **Long-Term Goals**: Tailor your distribution based on when you plan to retire and your projected lifestyle in retirement.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation for optimal benefits.
