Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Fund an IRA**
   - If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA (either traditional or Roth) since these accounts can provide tax advantages. 

### 3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maximizing your IRA, increase contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - If you have additional funds, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and potential liquidity. These can be useful for shorter-term goals or emergencies.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Traditional accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - Roth accounts allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts incur capital gains tax on profits. Consider the tax implications of your investments and holding periods.

### 6. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across different asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) and consider your risk tolerance to guide asset allocation in each account.

### 7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Monitor your investments and rebalance as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

### Additional Considerations
- **Age and Proximity to Retirement**: Younger investors may focus more on growth, while those nearing retirement might prioritize stability.
- **Financial Goals**: Align your distributions with specific goals, such as buying a home or funding education.

### Conclusion
It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your unique situation. Adjusting your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and goals is also important.
