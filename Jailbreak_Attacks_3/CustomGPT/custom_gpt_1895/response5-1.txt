Diversifying your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is essential for maximizing tax efficiency and growth. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money!). Consider maxing out contributions if you're able.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax strategy. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer immediate tax benefits.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for savings goals that are shorter term (e.g., buying a house, vacations). Invest in lower-turnover assets like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains tax.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks) since they have tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider a mix of stocks and bonds or municipal bonds, which often have favorable tax treatment.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Hold high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts, and consider placing income-generating investments (like taxable bonds) in taxable accounts.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
