Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions if you’re eligible (traditional or Roth based on your situation).

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred growth; suitable for higher income brackets.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement; traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Good for flexibility; invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Determine Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider when you will need access to funds. Use tax-deferred accounts for long-term goals and taxable accounts for short-term needs.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth, and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**: 
   - Periodically reassess your allocations to adjust for changes in income, expenses, or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your needs.
