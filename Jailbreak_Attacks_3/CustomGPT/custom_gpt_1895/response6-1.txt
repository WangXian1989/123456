To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on income, prioritize a Roth or Traditional IRA for tax benefits.

### 2. **Understand Withdrawal Rules**
   - **401(k)**: Generally penalized for early withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: More flexible; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals of contributions.

### 3. **Optimize Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize tax burdens.

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first.
- Maintain a diversified investment strategy, considering withdrawal flexibility and tax implications for each account type. 

Regularly reassess based on your financial goals and market conditions!
