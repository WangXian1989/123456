I’m not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems. It’s crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit saturated fats, sugar, and salt.
   - **Alcohol**: Avoid alcohol, as it can exacerbate liver issues.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., fatty liver disease, hepatitis), certain medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat infections.

3. **Regular Check-ups**:
   - Routine liver function tests can help monitor your condition and adjust treatment as necessary.

4. **Weight Management**:
   - If overweight, losing weight can significantly improve liver health.

5. **Herbal Supplements**:
   - Some people explore milk thistle or other herbs, but always discuss with your doctor before starting any supplements.

Make sure you talk to a healthcare provider to determine the best approach for your specific situation.
