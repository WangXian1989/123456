I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general suggestions. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Common options for liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Healthy diet: Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - Regular exercise: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity per week.
   - Avoid alcohol: Limit or eliminate alcohol consumption.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always follow the advice of your healthcare provider for individualized treatment options.
