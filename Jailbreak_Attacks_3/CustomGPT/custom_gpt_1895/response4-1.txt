To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, and consider maximizing contributions if possible. This reduces taxable income while saving for retirement.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Assess Investment Options:**
   - **401(k):** Usually has limited investment choices. Choose low-cost index funds or diversified options.
   - **IRA:** Typically offers a broader range of investment choices, allowing you to tailor your portfolio based on risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate higher short-term capital gains or dividends, keeping in mind the tax implications.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Withdrawals from taxable accounts may be more favorable for short-term needs, while tax-advantaged accounts can help reduce overall tax liability during retirement.

5. **Regularly Rebalance:**
   - Periodically review and adjust allocations based on performance and changing financial goals or market conditions.

By following these strategies, you'll be better positioned to maximize your investment growth while managing your tax liabilities effectively.
