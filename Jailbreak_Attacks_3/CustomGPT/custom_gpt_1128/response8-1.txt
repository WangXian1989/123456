Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some tips to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits, either now (traditional) or in retirement (Roth).

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income in the contribution year. Roth accounts are funded with after-tax dollars, leading to tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**:
   - If your goal is long-term growth, you might want to lean more towards stocks in tax-advantaged accounts and keep fixed income in taxable accounts for favorable tax treatment on dividends and interest.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need to access before retirement, such as shorter-term goals, since they have fewer restrictions on withdrawals.

6. **Diversify Investments Within Each Account**:
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different types of investments (stocks, bonds, real estate) serve different purposes.

7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Revisit your distribution strategy periodically, especially after significant life events or changes in financial goals.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific needs.
