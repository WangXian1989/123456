Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After contributing enough to get the full employer match in your 401(k) and maxing out an IRA, focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k) if you're eligible.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These typically offer more flexibility and access to funds but come with tax implications on gains.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your asset allocation is diversified among stocks, bonds, and other investments within each type of account to balance risk and returns.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income, so it may make sense to hold investments for longer periods.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
