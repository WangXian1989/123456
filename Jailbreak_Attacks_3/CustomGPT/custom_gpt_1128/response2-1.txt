When considering how to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take a strategic approach based on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough to get the full employer match** (if available). This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

### 2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - If you qualify for tax deductions (Traditional IRA) or prefer tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA), contribute here next.
     - The annual contribution limits are generally lower than 401(k).

   - **401(k)**: 
     - After maximizing the match, consider contributing beyond that limit, especially if you have a higher income and prefer tax deferral.

### 3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals**
   - Use taxable accounts for money you may need in the short term (like buying a house) or for investments that aren't tax-efficient in retirement accounts (e.g., certain bonds).

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Stocks vs. Bonds**: 
     - Higher growth investments (like stocks) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.
     - Bonds or other income-generating investments might be better in taxable accounts since they can trigger higher tax rates.

### 5. **Rebalancing and Tax Considerations**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changes in your financial goals.
   - Be mindful of tax implications when withdrawing funds from taxable accounts, as they may incur capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - The best strategy can vary based on personal circumstances, so consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a plan to your specific needs.

### Summary
1. Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
2. Max out IRA contributions if applicable.
3. Use taxable accounts for short-term needs and specific investment strategies.
4. Regularly review your asset allocation and tax implications.

This balanced approach helps ensure that youâ€™re leveraging tax advantages while also maintaining liquidity as needed.
