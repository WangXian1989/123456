Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for the 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t offer tax advantages but can provide flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Investment Preferences**:
   - Higher-risk investments might be better suited to tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - More conservative or income-generating investments may be better in taxable accounts, where you can manage tax implications more actively.

4. **Assess Your Timeline**: 
   - If you’re close to retirement, focus on safety and income generation.
   - For younger investors, prioritize growth through aggressive investments.

5. **Tax Planning**: Consider your current and expected future tax rates:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.
   - If you anticipate a lower rate, traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes to manage risk effectively.

7. **Review Regularly**: Regularly check and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and goals.
