The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k):** Maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals can be tax-free. A traditional IRA may be beneficial for immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high taxable income, such as stocks, which are subject to capital gains tax but may be beneficial for long-term growth. This account can also provide more flexibility for withdrawals compared to retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments are diversified across these accounts to manage risk better. Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Tax Efficiency:** Be mindful of the tax implications of holding different investments in taxable vs. tax-advantaged accounts. For instance, it may be wise to hold bonds, which yield taxable interest, in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping stocks in taxable accounts for potential capital gains treatment.

6. **Review Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your changing financial situation and goals.
