When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some guidelines to follow:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** After maximizing any employer matching in your 401(k), consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly impact your long-term savings.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:** Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Prioritize holding assets that generate income (like dividends) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Emergency Fund:** Before aggressively investing, ensure you have an emergency fund that can cover 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure that your investment strategy is diversified across different asset classes to manage risks effectively. Your 401(k) likely has limited investment options, so balance the rest in your IRA and taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** As you contribute, regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and investment strategy based on your goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your financial situation and goals.
