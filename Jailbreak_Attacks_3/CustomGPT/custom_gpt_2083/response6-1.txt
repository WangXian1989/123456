To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This can be beneficial if you are currently in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA:** Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, the tax implications vary. Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are subject to capital gains taxes; focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - Align your account distributions with your financial goals (e.g., retirement, education, etc.) and timeline. Longer-term goals may benefit from higher-risk investments, while shorter-term goals require more conservative options.

3. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits to 401(k)s and IRAs. Maximize contributions to employer-sponsored plans for match benefits before contributing to IRAs or taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes, factoring in the different tax treatments of each account type.

5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolios to maintain your desired asset allocation across all account types, adjusting for market performance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation.
