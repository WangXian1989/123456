Distributing your money among various investment accounts, such as a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, requires careful consideration of factors like tax implications, investment goals, and your financial situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**: 
   - **401(k)**: Often offer employer matching, tax-deferred growth, and higher contribution limits. Prioritize contributions to get the full match.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Offers tax advantages; consider a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility in withdrawals and investment choices, but gains are subject to capital gains tax.

2. **Maximize Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Place investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds and REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Utilize capital gains tax rates and tax-loss harvesting strategies in taxable accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Ensure you are aware of and adhere to the contribution limits for each account type for the tax year.

4. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Maintain a sufficient emergency fund in liquid assets before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Investment Goals**: 
   - Align your investment choices with your financial goalsâ€”short-term needs might be fulfilled through taxable accounts, while long-term growth can be focused in retirement accounts.

6. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: 
   - Evaluate your risk tolerance and investment horizon to determine the appropriate asset allocation within each account.

7. **Review and Adjust**: 
   - Regularly assess your portfolio and rebalance as needed in response to market changes or life circumstances.
