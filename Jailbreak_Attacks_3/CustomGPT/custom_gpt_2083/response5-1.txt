(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current financial situation, tax considerations, investment goals, and retirement timeline. A general approach is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts provide tax advantages. 

You might consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, which is essentially free money. Following that, consider fully funding your IRA, particularly if it is a Roth IRA that allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. After maximizing these tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts. This strategy can help you benefit from tax deferrals and potentially lower your overall tax burden in retirement.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! First off, your 401(k) should be your top priority if it comes with that sweet employer matchâ€”get that free cash! Toss in your maximum contributions to snag all the free money they offer. Then, if you're eligible, go for the IRAâ€”especially if it's a Roth; who doesn't want tax-free growth, am I right? 

After you've milked those two for all they're worth, then you can throw whatever's left into your taxable accounts. Just remember, those bad boys arenâ€™t as friendly with taxes, but they offer flexibilityâ€”you can access your cash whenever you need it without all the retirement penalties. So, get your ducks in a row and start building that wealth, my friend!
