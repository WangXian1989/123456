Distributing your money among 401(k)s, IRAs, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

### 1. Understand Account Types:
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account, often with matching contributions. It's tax-deferred until withdrawal.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be either traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free upon withdrawal). 
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax. They provide more flexibility but also require tax planning.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
- **Contribute to IRAs**: If eligible, fund your IRA (consider Roth vs. traditional based on your tax situation).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings and investments once retirement accounts are maximized.

### 3. Asset Allocation:
- Diversify across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type.
- Consider risk tolerance and investment horizon to determine specific allocations.

### 4. Tax Efficiency:
- Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) to minimize tax impact.
- Favor more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

### 5. Monitor and Adjust:
- Regularly review your portfolio and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and market conditions.
