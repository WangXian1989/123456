To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, which is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** Depending on your income, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs have the benefit of tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Ensure your asset allocation reflects your risk tolerance and investment goals. Typically, you might have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments across these accounts.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Suitable for investments that generate lower taxes, such as qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, or cash reserves for short-term needs.
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on higher-growth investments, as taxes are deferred until withdrawal.

4. **Review Contribution Limits:**
   - Stay informed about the yearly contribution limits for each account type to optimize your savings.

5. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially after major market movements.

By considering these aspects, you can tailor your distribution strategy to maximize growth while minimizing tax implications.
