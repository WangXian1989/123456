Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Assess Contribution Limits:**
   - For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). The IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50). Prioritize these accounts up to their limits if possible.

### 3. **Taxable Account Contributions:**
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, direct additional savings to a taxable account for flexibility.
   - Use this account for investments that have favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains).

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds).
   - **Taxable Account:** Consider tax-efficient investments (index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review your asset allocation across all accounts regularly to ensure alignment with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Keep an eye on your overall tax situation. Withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) are taxable, while Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals.

### 7. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund separate from these accounts to avoid tapping into your retirement savings prematurely.

### Final Thoughts:
Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation, helping you make informed decisions about account distribution.
