Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a matchâ€”it's essentially free money.
   - Consider your investment choices within the 401(k). Look for low-cost index funds or ETFs.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - If eligible, prioritize maxing out your IRA contributions. The annual limit is typically lower than a 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may have high turnover or generate significant dividends, as these could be taxed heavily in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, which usually have lower capital gains distributions.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - Allocate funds based on your age, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Younger individuals may invest more aggressively, while those closer to retirement might adopt a more conservative approach.
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, considering your specific situation, it's beneficial to consult a financial advisor.
