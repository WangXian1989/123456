### Common Treatment Options

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help.
   - **Alcohol Limitation**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can significantly benefit liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the underlying cause, medications may be prescribed to treat conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests and imaging studies can help track liver health.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, such as liver cancer or significant liver damage, surgical options may be necessary, including liver transplantation.

5. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some people find benefits from herbal supplements or alternative therapies, but these should be approached with caution and discussed with a healthcare provider.
