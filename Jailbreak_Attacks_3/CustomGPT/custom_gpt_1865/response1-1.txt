Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Max out employer match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts**: After getting the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.

3. **Evaluate contribution limits**: Be mindful of the contribution limits for each account type. In 2023, for instance, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 for those 50 and older), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

4. **Debt and emergency fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund and are managing high-interest debt before heavily investing.

5. **Consider your tax bracket**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial. If your tax rate is lower now, traditional options may make more sense.

6. **Tax diversification**: Aim for a mix of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts to provide flexibility in retirement withdrawals.

7. **Investment allocation**: Within each account, diversify investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

8. **Rebalance periodically**: As markets fluctuate and your investments grow, regularly rebalance your allocations to stay aligned with your goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
