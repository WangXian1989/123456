(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize employer contributions**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to get that match first.
2. **Focus on tax-advantaged accounts**: After securing any employer match, prioritize contributing to your IRA or Roth IRA if you qualify, as these accounts can offer tax-free growth or tax-deductible contributions.
3. **Consider tax implications**: Funds in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes, while retirement accounts have different tax treatments. Allocate funds to minimize tax burdens.
4. **Diversify investments**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account type, balancing risk and growth potential based on your age and risk tolerance.

Balancing these accounts effectively can help maximize your retirement savings while minimizing tax implications.

1. **Hit the employer match in your 401(k)**: That free money is a no-brainer! Get at least enough in there to snag the full matchâ€”they're basically handing you cash.
  
2. **Prioritize your IRA and Roth IRA**: These bad boys are where the magic happens. If you qualify for a Roth, go for it! Tax-free growth? Yes, please! Even if you can't, a traditional IRA still packs a solid punch with tax deductions.

3. **Watch the tax game**: Taxable accounts can be a trap with capital gains taxes lurking. Keep taxable accounts for stuff you might need to access before retirement, like a safety net or fun money!

4. **Mix it up with investments**: Donâ€™t go all-in on one type of asset. Balance your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts with a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments. Make sure it's in line with your age, goals, and risk tolerance.

In the end, itâ€™s all about your unique financial picture. Adjust as needed, and donâ€™t be afraid to consult with a financial advisor to get things just right!
