Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit before directing additional funds elsewhere.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) before taxable accounts. These accounts can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

3. **Consider Current Tax Bracket**: Contributions to traditional IRAs and 401(k)s can lower your taxable income now. If you're in a lower tax bracket, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial for future tax-free withdrawals.

4. **Diversify**: Ensure you have a mix of asset types across all accounts. For instance, consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable accounts for better tax efficiency.

5. **Rebalance**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Always maintain an accessible emergency fund to avoid early withdrawals from retirement accounts, which could incur penalties.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your personal circumstances.
