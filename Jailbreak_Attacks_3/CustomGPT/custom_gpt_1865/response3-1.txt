To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Understand the Types of Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offered by employers with potential matching contributions; contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages, with Traditional IRAs being tax-deductible, and Roth IRAs offering tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed on capital gains and dividends, offering more flexibility but less favorable tax treatment compared to retirement accounts.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Ensure high-interest debts are managed and an emergency fund is in place before investing heavily.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) vs. IRA**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, focus on traditional accounts; if expecting a higher bracket, consider Roth accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for shorter-term needs or investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds with low turnover).

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments within these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Maintain an appropriate balance between stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your allocation at least annually to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider professional advice tailored to your financial situation and goals.

By balancing contributions and considering tax implications and diversification strategies, you can create an effective distribution plan for your retirement savings and investments.
