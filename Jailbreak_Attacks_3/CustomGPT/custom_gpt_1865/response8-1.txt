Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Fund IRA Next**:
   - Choose between a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - If eligible, consider contributing the maximum allowed annually.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, funnel additional funds into your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. Taxable accounts offer flexibility but come with capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different accounts. For instance, place higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help tailor the strategy to your specific situation.

Make sure to adjust this strategy based on your unique circumstances and any changes in financial regulations.
