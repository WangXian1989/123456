To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types and Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers tax-deferred growth. Employer matching contributions can significantly enhance your savings.
   - **IRA:** Both traditional and Roth IRAs provide tax advantages, with the Roth allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts provide flexibility in accessing funds but are subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Asset Allocation Strategy:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **Focus on Tax-Efficient Investments:**
     - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
     - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.
   - **Diversify Investments:** Ensure you have a mix of stocks and bonds across all accounts tailored to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

3. **Contributions and Withdrawals:**
   - **Prioritize Contributions:** Start with your 401(k) (up to employer match), then contribute to an IRA, and finally allocate funds to taxable accounts.
   - **Consider Future Withdrawals:** If you anticipate needing funds before retirement, keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts, as withdrawals from retirement accounts may incur penalties.

4. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly assess your investment performance and risk tolerance.
   - Adjust your contributions and allocations based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and life events.

By strategically distributing funds across these accounts, you can optimize your tax efficiency and growth potential for long-term financial health.
