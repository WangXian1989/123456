It's important to tailor your investment strategy to your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines you might consider when distributing funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the maximum match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA for Tax Advantages:** Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, contributing to an IRA can provide tax benefits. A traditional IRA offers tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Balance Your Contributions:** Allocate funds between accounts based on your current and expected future tax situation. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, you might favor Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)).

4. **Considerations for Taxable Accounts:** Funds in taxable accounts can provide liquidity and flexibility for short-term goals or emergencies. Keep in mind the tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes and sectors, regardless of the account type.

6. **Monitor and Adjust:** Regularly review your investment strategy and retirement goals, and adjust your contributions and allocations as needed.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A financial advisor can help customize a plan that fits your unique circumstances.

Remember, each individual's situation is different, and it's crucial to consider your long-term financial goals when deciding on this allocation.
