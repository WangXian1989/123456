The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match available, as this is essentially free money.
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) if you're in your peak earning years and want to lower your taxable income now.

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional or Roth):**
   - If you can, contribute to both a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Determine eligibility for tax deductions based on your income level and filing status.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may have higher potential growth or for funds you plan to use before retirement.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across these accounts to spread risk.
   - You might want to hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to take advantage of tax benefits.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - If you have a longer time until retirement, you may prefer to invest more heavily in stocks for growth in your 401(k) and IRAs.
   - As you near retirement, you might want to shift to more conservative investments in these accounts.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - Review your allocations regularly and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help you create a personalized strategy tailored to your specific needs and goals.
