When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to take into account, including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) until you reach the employer match limit. Focus on maxing out contributions if you have a high-income potential and if the 401(k) has low fees and good investment options.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. A Roth offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions upfront.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for more flexibility with withdrawals and potential capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, and consider your risk tolerance when making these allocations.

6. **Adjust for Tax Efficiency**: Keep tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Review and adjust your plan annually based on changes in income, tax laws, or personal financial goals.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific circumstances.
