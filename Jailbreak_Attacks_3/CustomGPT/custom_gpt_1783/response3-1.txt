Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: If you can afford it and have already contributed to your IRA, maximize your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit. This can reduce your taxable income.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve fully funded your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can offer flexibility for short-term goals and are subject to capital gains taxes, so choose investments wisely (e.g., low-turnover funds).

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Think about your current and future tax rates when deciding where to put your money. For example, placing investments that generate high dividends or interest in tax-advantaged accounts may be more beneficial.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.
