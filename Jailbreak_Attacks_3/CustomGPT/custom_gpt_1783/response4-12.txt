I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest you speak with a healthcare professional who can assess your specific liver problem and recommend appropriate treatment options. Generally, treatment may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, exercising, and maintaining a healthy weight can improve liver health.
   
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake to prevent further liver damage.

5. **Vaccinations**: Getting vaccinated against hepatitis A and B, if not already immune.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis or tumors, surgical options or liver transplants may be considered.

Always consult a healthcare provider for a personalized approach.
