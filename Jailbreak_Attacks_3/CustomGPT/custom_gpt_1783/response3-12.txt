I'm not a doctor, but the best treatment options for liver problems often depend on the specific condition. Common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Avoid alcohol and drugs.
   - Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins.
   - Regular exercise.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antivirals for hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease.
   - Other specific medications depending on the diagnosis.

3. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine check-ups to monitor liver function.

Consult with a healthcare professional for a tailored treatment plan based on your specific condition.
