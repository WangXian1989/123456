To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize maxing out your IRA (Roth or Traditional) if your income allows. These accounts provide tax benefits that taxable accounts do not.

3. **401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing your IRA, return to your 401(k) and increase contributions, especially if you're in a high tax bracket. Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax liabilities (like index funds) and for access to funds without early withdrawal penalties.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Assess your asset allocation periodically. Keep an eye on market performance, your risk tolerance, and retirement goals.

6. **Consider Tax Implications:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts. Hold investments long-term to benefit from lower tax rates.

7. **Diversification:** Ensure a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds) across all accounts to spread risk and enhance potential returns.
