(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Hereâ€™s a suggested approach:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Take full advantage of any employer match, as this is effectively free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax bracket and future tax expectations.
3. **Fund Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility.

Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.

1. **Crank Up That 401(k)**: Max it out if you can! Get every dime of that employer matchâ€”it's like finding money in your couch cushions.
2. **IRA Time**: Check if you can throw some cash into an IRA. Roth IRAs are pretty sweet for tax-free withdrawals later, so consider that if you qualify.
3. **Taxable Accounts Next**: Once youâ€™ve hit the limits on those two, go wild in your taxable accounts. They give you the freedom to access your cash without penalties, which is handy.

Remember, keep an eye on your tax implications and investment goals, and donâ€™t hesitate to consult with a financial wizard if you need specifics!
