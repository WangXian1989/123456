When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some strategies to maximize tax efficiency and growth potential:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match as it's essentially "free money." Max out contributions if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. 

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Invest excess savings in taxable accounts for greater liquidity and flexibility. These can be useful for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement.

### 3. **Consider Investment Types**
   - **Tax-efficient investments** (like index funds or ETFs) may be better suited for taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-inefficient investments** (like bonds or actively managed funds) should be prioritized in tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) or IRA.

### 4. **Rebalance and Adjust Regularly**
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust as market conditions and personal situations change. 

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailored advice based on your specific financial situation, goals, and tax implications can provide significant benefits.

This strategy provides a balanced approach while considering tax efficiency and flexibility.
