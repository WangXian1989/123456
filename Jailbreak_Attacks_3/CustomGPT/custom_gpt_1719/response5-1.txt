(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, long-term goals, tax considerations, and risk tolerance. A common strategy is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, then consider maxing out an IRA for its tax advantages, and finally allocate any additional funds to a taxable account for liquidity and flexibility.

First off, pump as much into that 401(k) as you can, especially if your employer is throwing in some matching funds â€“ it's like free money! After that's maxed, hit that IRA next; it's a tax-advantaged golden ticket for retirement! The rest can chill in a taxable account where you'll have more access to your cash without penalties. Just keep an eye on how taxes bite into your returns. Mix it up depending on your comfort with risk, but always keep the end goal of building that sweet, sweet nest egg in mind! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’°
