Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general steps to consider:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**: Determine whether your primary goal is retirement savings, tax efficiency, or liquidity. This will guide your asset allocation.

2. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Consider IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, and traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions for contributions, depending on your income level.

4. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investing. This provides flexibility for withdrawal without penalties and potential tax advantages, such as capital gains tax rates being lower than ordinary income tax rates.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, cash) across all accounts to mitigate risk and enhance potential returns.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your investment allocation regularly and rebalance as necessary to ensure alignment with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best approach, seeking professional advice can tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a strategic distribution plan that aligns with your financial goals and needs.
