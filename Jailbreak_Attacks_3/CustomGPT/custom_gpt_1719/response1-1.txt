The best way to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Workplace Retirement Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**: 
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth; contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions now.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for funds you may need before retirement, but they don't offer the same tax advantages.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**: Aim for a balanced approach across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: As market values change, rebalance your accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Take into Account Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how and when you'll withdraw funds in retirement, as this can influence how you distribute your investments today.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.
