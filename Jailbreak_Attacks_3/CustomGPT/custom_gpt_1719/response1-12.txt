I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver issues, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional. Treatment options can vary widely based on the specific liver condition you're facing. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications, and in some cases, procedures or surgery. Always seek guidance from a qualified medical provider for personalized advice.
