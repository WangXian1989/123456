To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**: Understand whether you're saving for retirement, a major purchase, or other financial goals. Your time horizon will influence your investment strategy.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: With a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold. They offer flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

3. **Emergency Fund and Debt**: Before allocating funds to investment accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund and address any high-interest debt.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type.

5. **Max Out Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.

6. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type:
   - **401(k)**: $22,500 for 2023 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older)
   - **IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50 or older)

7. **Investment Choices**: Choose investments based on your risk tolerance and the time horizon for each account. Generally, long-term accounts like a 401(k) or IRA can afford to take more risk compared to taxable accounts meant for short-term goals.

8. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your investments and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced distribution of your funds that aligns with your financial objectives and risk tolerance.
