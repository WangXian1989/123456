Distributing funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money. For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 for those under 50 and $30,500 for those 50 and older.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth), depending on your tax situation and retirement plans. The limit for IRAs is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older) in 2024.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) offer tax deferral, meaning you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket then.
   - Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them ideal if you believe your tax rate will be higher in the future.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If youâ€™re investing for long-term goals (e.g., retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. 
   - For shorter-term goals, a taxable account might be more appropriate due to penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investment portfolio across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and consider how different accounts might be best suited for certain investments. For example, higher-growth investments can be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on growth.

5. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep in mind your liquidity needs when distributing funds. Taxable accounts provide easier access to cash without penalties, while retirement accounts have restrictions and potential penalties for early withdrawal.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustments**:
   - Review your asset allocation regularly and re-balance as needed based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
