Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly impact your long-term financial growth and tax efficiency. Here are some considerations to guide your strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions or if your employer doesnâ€™t match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial for tax-free growth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits:**
   - **Traditional Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions are often tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket upon retirement.

### 3. **Evaluate Investment Options:**
   - **401(k):** Typically, your investment choices are limited to what your employer offers. Ensure that you're selecting a diversified mix of assets that align with your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA:** You may have a wider range of investment options, allowing for more tailored asset allocation strategies.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on investments that might provide favorable tax treatment, such as index funds or municipal bonds to minimize tax consequences.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid account before heavily investing in tax-advantaged accounts. 
   - Funds needed in the short term should generally be kept in a taxable account or savings account.

### 5. **Review Annual Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA accounts. Adjust your contributions accordingly to maximize your savings without exceeding these limits.

### 6. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you expect your income to be lower in retirement, prioritizing tax-deferred accounts may be more beneficial. However, if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket, prioritizing Roth accounts might be wise.

### 7. **Diversification:**
   - Diversifying across different account types can provide tax efficiency and flexibility in retirement. Careful consideration of when to withdraw from each account type can help manage your tax liability in retirement.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowable amount, split between Traditional and Roth based on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Account:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest any additional savings in diversified taxable accounts.

Regularly reassess your contributions and asset allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change.
