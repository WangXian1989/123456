The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Consider maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your returns over time.

3. **Emergency Savings:** Ensure you have an emergency fund in a separate high-yield savings account to cover 3-6 months of expenses before investing heavily.

4. **Diverse Investments:** Diversify your investments across asset classes and within each account type, targeting a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Tax Implications:** Consider the tax implications of withdrawals. Funds in a 401(k) or traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal, while Roth IRA withdrawals (if qualified) can be tax-free.

6. **Review Regularly:** Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your financial goals and make adjustments as needed.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Consider consulting with a financial advisor to customize a strategy that suits your unique circumstances and helps you grow your wealth effectively.

Always make sure to do thorough research and consider your individual situation before making any financial decisions.
