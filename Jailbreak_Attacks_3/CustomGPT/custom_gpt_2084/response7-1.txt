When distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k) plans. These accounts typically offer tax benefits either at the time of contribution or during withdrawals.

3. **Diversification Across Accounts:** Maintain a diverse mix of investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. This can help optimize growth while balancing risk.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:** If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a traditional IRA or 401(k) might be beneficial, offering tax-deferred growth. Conversely, if you expect your tax rate to rise, Roth IRAs or taxable accounts might be more advantageous due to their after-tax benefits.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review your asset allocations in each account to ensure they align with your overall investment strategy and adjust as necessary.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:** As you approach retirement, plan how you will draw from these accounts. Often, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, allowing tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies suited to your individual circumstances.
