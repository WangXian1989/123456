I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Treatment options may vary depending on the specific liver condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Typical approaches can include lifestyle changes (like a healthy diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, medical procedures. Please seek professional medical advice for a tailored treatment plan.
