The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible now (traditional) or grow tax-free for retirement (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains in these accounts are taxed at capital gains rates, which can be lower than ordinary income rates, especially for long-term investments.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts, taking into account how each account type is structured regarding taxes and access to funds.

4. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement timeline.

5. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**: The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative you may want to be with your investments, particularly in taxable accounts where you may need access to funds.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals. 

Tailoring your contributions to these accounts based on these factors can help you maximize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
