To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - Identify short-term versus long-term objectives for each type of account.
   - Align your investment strategies with your risk tolerance.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to take full advantage of tax benefits.
   - Consider the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type when reaching retirement.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   - Allocate different asset classes in each account based on tax efficiency:
     - Place high-growth investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
     - Consider holding bonds or interest-generating assets in taxable accounts to offset interest income with losses.

4. **Monitor and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly review your distribution strategy to ensure it aligns with changing financial goals or market conditions.
   - Rebalancing can help maintain your desired risk level across different accounts.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment distribution for growth while managing tax liabilities effectively. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your individual circumstances.
