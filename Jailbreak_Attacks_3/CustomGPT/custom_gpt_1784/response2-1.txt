The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider when allocating your investments across these accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be your first priority.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before investing in taxable accounts. 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. If you're over 50, you may also be eligible for catch-up contributions.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, contributions can either be tax-deductible or tax-free upon withdrawal. Be aware of income limits for Roth contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices, though you will owe taxes on any capital gains and dividends.

4. **Investment Types**: Consider placing investments with high expected returns in tax-advantaged accounts to allow those gains to grow without incurring immediate taxes. Place lower-growth or tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-exempt bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're currently in a lower tax bracket, it might make sense to prioritize Roth IRA contributions (after-tax), as youâ€™ll pay taxes on the contributions now but enjoy tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

6. **Review and Adjust**: It's essential to review your asset allocation regularly and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a financial advisor can help you address your unique situation and optimize your investment distribution.

In summary, start with the employer match in your 401(k), maximize tax-advantaged accounts, then consider taxable accounts for additional investments. Always reassess your strategies based on your financial plans and goals.
