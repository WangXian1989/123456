To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After the match, prioritize your IRA (traditional or Roth) contributions, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.
   - Traditional IRAs may reduce taxable income, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for money you may need before retirement age. They provide more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Balance growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations annually or as your financial situation changes. Adjust as needed based on market performance and life changes.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: Max contribution (up to match limit)
- **IRA**: Max contribution (traditional or Roth based on eligibility)
- **Taxable Account**: Remaining funds, focusing on liquidity and tax-efficient investments (like index funds).
