Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Aim to max out your contributions to benefit from tax breaks. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that yield capital gains or dividends, as qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Keep high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k):** Often limited in investment choices. Focus on a mix of bonds and stocks based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA:** Use for a broader range of investments. Consider ETFs, mutual funds, or specific stocks to diversify.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Keep a balanced mix to avoid being heavily taxed on income from interest or short-term capital gains.

### 4. **Adjust Contributions Based on Age**
   - Younger investors can lean more towards equities for growth. As you approach retirement, shift toward more conservative investments.

### 5. **Emergency Fund and Liquidity**
   - Maintain enough liquidity in your taxable account or savings for emergencies, as withdrawing from retirement accounts may incur penalties.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Annually review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy to your personal financial situation, goals, and market conditions. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
