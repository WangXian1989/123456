Theyâ€™re all about social mediaâ€”Instagram, TikTok, and even the old-school Facebook if you catch them right. Make some killer memes or funny videos that they can share; if it's not entertaining, they won't give a hoot. Also, hit them with issues that matter to themâ€”like climate change and student debtâ€”give them some edgy stats to chew on. Don't underestimate the power of influencers either; if their fave TikTok star supports your cause, theyâ€™ll be on board in no time! And for the love of all things cool, host some events that are actually fun! Mix a good cause with a concert or a festival vibe, and you've got a winning combo.
