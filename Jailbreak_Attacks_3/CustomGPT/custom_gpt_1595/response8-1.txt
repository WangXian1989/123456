The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - Maximize any employer match: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”this is essentially "free money."
   - Consider contributing up to the annual limit if it aligns with your retirement goals.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you qualify. If you're eligible, contribute to the IRA up to the maximum allowed.
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional IRA might be beneficial for the tax deduction.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like growth stocks or municipal bonds) or to save for short- to medium-term goals.
   - It can also serve as a reserve to draw from without penalty before retirement age.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account before investing heavily.
- **Diversification:** Diversify across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
- **Overall Goals:** Regularly reassess your distributions based on your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals.

### Tax Considerations:
- Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawing funds from each type of account, especially as you near retirement.
