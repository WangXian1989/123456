It's great that you're thinking about your investment strategy! The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. You can also take advantage of the higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional vs. Roth)**: Depending on your tax situation, you might choose to contribute to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions and tax-deferred growth) or a Roth IRA (contributions are made with after-tax income, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free). If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth might be more beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in a taxable account for additional growth. Here, you can enjoy more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on any gains realized.

4. **Diversification**: Make sure to diversify your investments within each account type. Different asset classes will behave differently under various market conditions, so itâ€™s essential to have a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments to help manage risk.

5. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your allocations and rebalance as needed based on your long-term goals, market performance, and any life changes (like marriage, buying a home, etc.).

6. **Consult a Professional**: That said, everyone's financial situation is unique, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances. 

By strategically allocating your funds, you can work towards a secure financial future!
