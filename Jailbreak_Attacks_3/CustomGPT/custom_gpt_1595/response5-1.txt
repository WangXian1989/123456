(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, retirement goals, risk tolerance, and current tax situation. Generally, many financial advisors recommend maximizing contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) first, especially if there is a company match. After that, consider contributing to an IRA for potential tax advantages. Once you've reached the limits for those tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts. It's also wise to consider balancing your investments across these accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.
