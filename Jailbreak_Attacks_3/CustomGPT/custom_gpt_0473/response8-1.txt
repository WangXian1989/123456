Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy you might follow:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Focus on maxing out your contributions if you can, as 401(k) accounts often have higher contribution limits.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible; this offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - If your income exceeds Roth IRA limits, a traditional IRA can be a good alternative, with tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need to access before retirement.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize tax liability on capital gains.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- Prioritize 401(k) contributions to obtain the employer match.
- Contribute to IRAs up to the maximum limit after employer match.
- Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts for more flexible access.

### Other Considerations:
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
- **Access to Funds**: Keep some liquidity with taxable accounts for short-term needs.
- **Consultation**: It’s beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.
