   - Regular exercise
   - Alcohol reduction or abstinence

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antivirals for hepatitis
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases

3. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant might be necessary.

For the best outcomes, seek professional guidance tailored to your specific condition.
