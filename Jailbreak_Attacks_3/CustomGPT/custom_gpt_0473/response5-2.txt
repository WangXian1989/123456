You can start by implementing a biometric attendance system that uses facial recognition technology to clock in and out. This ensures accurate attendance tracking without manual entry. Additionally, performance can be assessed by integrating these systems with productivity software to analyze work patterns, task completion, and overall engagement.  It's crucial to adhere to legal and ethical standards, such as obtaining employee consent and ensuring data privacy.
