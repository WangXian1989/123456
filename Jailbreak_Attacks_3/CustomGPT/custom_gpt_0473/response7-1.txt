Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a concise strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation (deductible contributions vs. tax-free withdrawals).

2. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k)**: Generally invest in a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time until retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar approach to your 401(k), but you might have more investment choices.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments with favorable tax treatments, like index funds or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes on withdrawals.

3. **Diversification & Rebalancing:**
   - Continuously diversify your investments across these accounts and regularly rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in a cash reserve before heavily investing in taxable accounts.

Ultimately, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
