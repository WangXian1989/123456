Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Good for tax deductions now, but pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after taxes, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for more flexible access to funds.
   - Consider the tax implications of capital gains; long-term investments are taxed at a lower rate.

### Strategy:
- **Max Out Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match.
- **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your tax situation, prioritize a Roth or Traditional IRA.
- **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out the IRA, contribute more to the 401(k).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for cash flow needs and investments not suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

### Regular Review:
- Monitor and rebalance your investments according to your risk tolerance and market conditions.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
- Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

This balanced approach allows you to maximize growth while managing tax impacts effectively.
