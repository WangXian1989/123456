To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." 

2. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your eligibility, max out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may have a shorter horizon or for funds you'd need access to sooner. This is also where you'd invest in assets that benefit from long-term capital gains rates, like stocks.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider placing high-growth potential investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and fixed-income investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about your long-term withdrawal strategy when it comes time to retire, as different accounts have different tax implications during retirement.

7. **Consult a Professional**: If unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation.

This plan helps optimize tax efficiency while ensuring adequate growth for your retirement needs.
