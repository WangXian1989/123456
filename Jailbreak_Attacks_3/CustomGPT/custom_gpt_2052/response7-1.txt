Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if feasible.
- **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Otherwise, a traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation
- **Taxable Accounts:** These are best for investments you may need to access before retirement. They can also offer tax advantages through long-term capital gains rates.

### 3. Diversification
- Ensure a balanced allocation of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### 4. Consider Withdrawal Strategies
- Plan when you might withdraw from each account type. For instance, it could make sense to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let retirement accounts grow.

### 5. Consult a Financial Advisor
- Individual circumstances vary widely, so professional advice tailored to your unique situation can be invaluable.

### Example Allocation Strategy
1. **401(k):** Maximize employer match, then contribute up to the limit.
2. **IRA:** Fund a Roth IRA if you're eligible; otherwise, contribute to a traditional IRA.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for any additional savings or investments that donâ€™t fit into the above categories.

By focusing on tax advantages, diversification, and long-term strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution effectively.
