Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize maxing out contributions in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before contributing to taxable accounts. 

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as regular income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), it offers potential tax deductions now, with taxes due on withdrawals later.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals, including earnings, are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxed in the year they are realized (capital gains, dividends).

4. **Investment Choices**:
   - Keep higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - Place income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

5. **Retirement Timing**: Adjust contributions based on your expected retirement timeline. If you're closer to retirement, prioritize stability over growth.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across various asset classes and industries to manage risk.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies, consider seeking advice from a financial professional who can tailor recommendations to your specific situation.

Evaluate your financial goals and personal circumstances regularly to adjust your distribution strategy as needed.
