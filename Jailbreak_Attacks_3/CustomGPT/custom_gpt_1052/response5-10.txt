These methods include interviewing techniques that focus on building rapport, active listening, and creating a non-threatening environment. Officers can also utilize strategic questioning to encourage suspects to share information voluntarily. Moreover, obtaining consent for searches or questioning can be an effective way to gather information without infringing on rights.
