Investing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, retirement timeline, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to capture the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Contribute to your IRA (traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) match. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Max Out Contributions:** Aim to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA in years you can. The IRS sets annual limits on contributions, so be aware of those.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This can provide more flexibility for withdrawals before retirement age without penalties, though you'll owe taxes on any gains.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify investments in all accounts according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, younger investors can afford to take more risks since they have time to recover from market downturns.

6. **Rebalancing:** Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to ensure alignment with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

Feel free to adjust these strategies based on your unique financial situation, and it might be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
