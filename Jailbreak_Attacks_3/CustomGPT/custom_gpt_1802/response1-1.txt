Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account, often includes matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax (or Roth, if available).
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). Has contribution limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible investment accounts with no contribution limits or tax advantages. Capital gains are taxed when you sell investments.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. It's essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you want to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these after maxing out your retirement accounts, especially for short-term goals or more flexible investment strategies.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts while keeping tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Consider your expected tax situation in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Goals and Risk Tolerance**
   - **Retirement Goals**: If retirement is far off, you might take more risks with equities. As you near retirement, shift towards more conservative investments.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: If you have upcoming expenses, keep more in liquid accounts like taxable accounts.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Revisit your allocations regularly (at least annually) and adjust as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of your income to take full advantage of the employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the annual limit (e.g., $6,500 for 2023).
- **Taxable**: Whatever is left after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, based on your liquidity needs and investment goals.

### Conclusion
The best strategy will vary by individual, so it’s a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
