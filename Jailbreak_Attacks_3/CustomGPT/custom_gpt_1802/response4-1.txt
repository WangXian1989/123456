Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match since it's essentially free money. Aim to max out your 401(k) if possible, as it reduces your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial; if not, a Traditional IRA might be preferable.

2. **Consider Investment Growth Potential**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are good for investments that might generate high dividends or short-term capital gains, as you'll pay taxes annually on those earnings. Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments or those you may want to access before retirement age.

3. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account to balance risk and return. Ensure diversification aligns with your overall investment strategy.

4. **Rebalance Your Portfolio**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations across accounts to maintain your desired risk level and investment objectives. 

5. **Consider Future Financial Needs**:
   - Assess when you might need to access funds. Taxable accounts can provide quicker access without penalties compared to retirement accounts.

6. **Tax Implications**:
   - Evaluate the tax implications of any withdrawals. Taxable accounts may have different tax structures than tax-advantaged accounts, which can enhance your overall return strategy.

7. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Prior to heavy investing, ensure you have an emergency fund in place, ideally covering 3-6 months of living expenses, which should not be placed in these investment accounts.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Finally, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
