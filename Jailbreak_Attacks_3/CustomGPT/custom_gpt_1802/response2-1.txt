Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute at least enough to get any company match; this is essentially free money. If your employer offers a Roth 401(k), consider that option if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These should generally be used for investments that generate long-term capital gains, qualified dividends, or could potentially offset capital losses. Keeping bonds and other interest-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts can minimize taxable income.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to reduce annual tax liabilities.

### 3. **Investment Horizon and Goals**
   - **Short-Term Goals (1-5 years):** Consider keeping funds in a taxable account for flexibility and ease of access.
   - **Long-Term Goals (5+ years):** Prioritize funding your 401(k) and IRA as they offer compounding tax benefits.

### 4. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - Diversify your investments across different accounts and asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk effectively.

### 5. **Regular Contributions and Rebalancing**
   - Set up automatic contributions to ensure you're consistently funding these accounts. Periodically review your allocations and rebalance as needed.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A personalized approach from a financial planner can provide strategies tailored to your specific situation, including changes to tax legislation and individual financial objectives.

### Conclusion
Balanced distribution among these accounts often leads to better overall financial health. Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts while considering your short- and long-term goals to create a robust financial strategy.
