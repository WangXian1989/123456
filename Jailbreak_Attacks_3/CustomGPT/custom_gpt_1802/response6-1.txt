Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors, including tax implications, investment goals, and retirement timelines. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** If your focus is on retirement, prioritize contributions to retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts.
   - **Short-Term Goals:** For goals within the next few years, lean towards taxable accounts for easier access to funds without penalties.

### 3. **Diversification Needs**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio in each account type, but consider placing investments that generate taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping stocks in taxable accounts for potential long-term capital gains treatment.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. For instance, withdrawing money early from a 401(k) or an IRA incurs penalties, while taxable accounts offer flexibility with capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- Start with maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to the match.
- Next, contribute to an IRA up to the maximum limit.
- After that, allocate funds to taxable accounts for immediate or mid-term financial goals.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 15% of gross income (maxing out to employer match)
- **IRA:** 10% of gross income
- **Taxable Account:** Remaining income as needed based on cash flow needs

Adjust these percentages based on your personal financial situation, ensuring you review them regularly.
