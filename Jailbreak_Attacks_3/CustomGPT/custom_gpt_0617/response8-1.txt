Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts optimally involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here's a general guideline to help you determine the best approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer matching contributions if available. It's essentially “free money,” so try to contribute enough to get the full match.
   - If you haven't reached the contribution limit, consider maximizing your contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility.
   - A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funds that you might need in the short term or for investments that generate lower tax liabilities, such as municipal bonds or long-term capital gain stocks.
   - Consider tax loss harvesting strategies to offset gains and manage taxes efficiently.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure your asset allocation reflects your risk tolerance and investment goals. All accounts combined should align with your investment strategy (e.g., stocks, bonds, cash).
   - Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy** (for retirement):
   - Plan when and how to withdraw funds from each account type to minimize your tax burden in retirement.
   - Typically, you may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It might be beneficial to discuss your specific situation with a financial advisor who can tailor the strategy to your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

Overall, your strategy should focus on optimizing for growth while considering taxes, matching contributions, and liquidity needs.
