Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategy focused on maximizing tax efficiency and aligning with your financial goals. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Tax Considerations:**
- **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, allowing your investments to grow tax-deferred until withdrawal. Prioritize maxing out employer matches.
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals. Consider your current and future tax rates.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. Use this account for short-term goals or to hold tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds.

### 2. **Investment Goals:**
- Assess your risk tolerance and investment horizon to determine how to allocate funds across the accounts and asset classes.

### Recommendations:
- **Maximize Contributions:** Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to benefit from any employer match, then fund an IRA, and finally allocate funds to a taxable account.
- **Growth vs. Income Investments:**
  - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes.
  - Use taxable accounts for income-generating assets, as dividends and interest can be taxed at lower rates.

### Implementation:
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market changes and personal circumstances to ensure they align with your long-term objectives.

This strategy can help you effectively distribute your assets while minimizing tax liabilities and enhancing your overall investment growth. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
