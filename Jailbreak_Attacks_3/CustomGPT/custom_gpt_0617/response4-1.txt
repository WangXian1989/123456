The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great starting point.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the employer match, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your IRA (traditional or Roth). These accounts provide beneficial tax treatment, either on a pre-tax basis (traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Contributions to a traditional IRA may also be tax-deductible, and qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes, which can be advantageous if you hold assets for the long term.

4. **Account Types**: Beyond just 401(k) and IRA accounts, consider the types of investments you hold within each account. Generally:
   - Place higher-growth assets (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where gains can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - Hold lower-growth or dividend-paying investments (which may be taxed at a lower rate) in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified asset allocation across all your accounts to manage risk while aiming for your desired returns.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As market conditions change or as you approach retirement, review and adjust your asset allocations across accounts to maintain your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Once retired, plan a withdrawal strategy that minimizes taxes. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow can be beneficial.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider working with a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy based on your goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

By keeping these strategies in mind, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize growth and minimize taxes over time.
