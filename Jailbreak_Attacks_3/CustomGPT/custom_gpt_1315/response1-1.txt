Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (both traditional and Roth, depending on your income and tax situation) for long-term tax benefits.
   - **401(k)**: After maximizing the IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investments once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. These can provide more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments in each account are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.
