(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, a good approach is:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if it's a Roth IRA, as it provides tax-free growth.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for any additional savings. They are flexible and accessible, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing goals and market conditions.

1. **401(k):** Go for that employer match firstâ€”it's like finding free cash hidden under your couch cushions! Max it out while you're at it if you can, because it's tax-deferred growth and a sweet deal.
  
2. **IRA:** Next up is your IRA. If youâ€™ve got a Roth, load that bad boy upâ€”tax-free growth is the dream! If it's a traditional IRA, that deductibility is huge, so donâ€™t sleep on it.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Lastly, throw whateverâ€™s left into taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re flexible, but watch those capital gains; it's like the IRS waiting at the finish line for your winnings. Flexibility here means you can access funds without penaltiesâ€”perfect for when life throws you a curveball.

Invest wisely and adjust as life changes!
