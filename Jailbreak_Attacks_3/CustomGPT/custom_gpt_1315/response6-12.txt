1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight and improves liver function.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or promote healing.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Routine liver function tests to monitor the health and progress of any liver condition.
