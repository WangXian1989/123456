To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this for its tax advantages, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket. Choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional IRA for tax-deductible benefits or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your eligibility.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investment flexibility and to access cash without penalties. Consider index funds or ETFs for tax efficiency.

3. **Balance Investment Options**: Use your 401(k) for higher-fee assets or funds with limited options. Focus on low-cost index funds in your IRA and choose tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Aim to hold investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and consider placing tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

This strategy can help optimize growth while considering tax efficiency. Always review your plan periodically and adjust as needed to align with your financial situation and goals.
