Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Max Out your 401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k), contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA to further tax-defer or tax-free grow your investments.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals:** Use these for investments you might need to access in the near term. Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds).
   - **Long-Term Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Maximize growth over time in your 401(k) and IRA, where taxes on gains are deferred or avoided.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **More Aggressive in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Hold higher-risk investments for growth in your 401(k) and IRA since withdrawals in retirement will have tax implications.
   - **More Conservative in Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding bonds or stable investments which may generate regular income, taxed at a higher rate.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions effectively across these account types based on your specific financial situation can optimize your retirement savings and investment growth. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your unique circumstances.
