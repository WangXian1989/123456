To effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions up to the match, then consider maxing out your IRA.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for its tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement or for short-term goals.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxable events.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate income (e.g., bonds) that may be taxed at favorable rates.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your asset allocation is consistent across all accounts, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.

6. **Regularly Review**: Adjust your contributions and asset allocation periodically based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

By following these steps, you can optimize your investment strategy while maximizing tax efficiency.
