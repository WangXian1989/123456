Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money. Aim to contribute to the max limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs give you tax deductions now.

2. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. Generally, equities can go into the tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, while more stable investments can be kept in taxable accounts for easier access if needed.

3. **Think About Tax Implications**:
   - Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes. Conversely, consider holding assets with lower income generation in taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalance**:
   - Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation and goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes your investment growth while minimizing taxes.
