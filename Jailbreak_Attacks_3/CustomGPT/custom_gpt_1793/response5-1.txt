Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Once you’ve maximized the match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax preferences). These accounts grow tax-free or tax-deferred, providing a significant advantage.

3. **Continue With 401(k)**: After fully funding your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual maximum limit. 

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts. This can be beneficial for flexible access to funds and can help with tax diversification.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, and other investment vehicles.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust based on changes in financial circumstances, goals, or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain, consider consulting with a financial planner to tailor a strategy that fits your individual needs.

This personalized approach helps balance growth potential with tax efficiency.
