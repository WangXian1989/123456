Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you can deduct them from your taxable income, which provides a tax advantage.

### 3. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k) (plus a $7,500 catch-up if over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 for catch-up).

### 4. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These can be suitable for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

### 5. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Choose investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Usually, youâ€™ll want more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts since taxes can be deferred or avoided.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

### Example Allocation Approach:
- **401(k):** Contribute up to employer match, then max out IRA.
- **IRA:** If possible, prioritizing Roth options (if you expect your tax rate to increase).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional savings here, focusing on tax-efficient strategies.

### Final Thoughts:
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
