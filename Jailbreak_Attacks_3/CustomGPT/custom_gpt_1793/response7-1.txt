The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you've maximized retirement account contributions.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) and lower-tax investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk. Allocate across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your future withdrawals by considering tax implications. It may be advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first during retirement to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

5. **Consider Your Timeline**:
   - If youâ€™re younger, focus on growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA. As you approach retirement, consider shifting towards more stable, income-generating investments.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment allocations and adjust them as needed based on your life changes, market conditions, or financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
