Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Max Contribution:** Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options:** Choose funds that align with your risk tolerance. Consider a mix of stocks and bonds based on your age and retirement timeline.

2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth):**
   - **Tax Benefits:** If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. A traditional IRA can be beneficial if you want immediate tax deductions.
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Aim to maximize annual contributions to benefit from tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Use taxable accounts for money you may need before retirement. Keep a diversified mix to optimize growth while managing tax implications.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund:** Maintain 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid savings account.
- **Allocation:** Typically, a diversified approach (e.g., 70% equities, 30% bonds) is recommended for long-term growth, adjusting as you near retirement.
- **Periodic Rebalancing:** Review and adjust your allocations regularly to stay aligned with your goals.

### Consult a Professional:
Consider seeking advice from a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
