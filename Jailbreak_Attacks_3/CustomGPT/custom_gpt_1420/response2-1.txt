Distributing money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—it's free money. If possible, max out contributions (limit for 2024 is $22,500, or $30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions now (limit for 2024 is $6,500, or $7,500 if over 50).

2. **Invest for Growth**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts primarily for higher-growth investments since withdrawals will be taxed less favorably in a taxable account.

3. **Build a Taxable Account**:
   - Once retirement accounts are maximized, use taxable accounts for additional investments. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Adjust Based on Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of required minimum distributions (RMDs) in retirement, particularly for traditional accounts.

5. **Diversification and Risk Management**:
   - Ensure a diversified mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts according to your overall investment strategy.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust based on market performance and changes in your goals.

Remember, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your unique situation.
