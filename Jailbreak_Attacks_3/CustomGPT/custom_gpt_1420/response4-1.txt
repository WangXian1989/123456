To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k) in terms of tax deferral, but contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and coverage by an employer plan. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold, and income generated (dividends, interest) is taxed annually.

2. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - **401(k) and IRAs**: Early withdrawals may incur penalties.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them a good option for short-term savings or emergency funds.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If you have a long-term horizon (e.g., retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth.
   - For medium or short-term goals (e.g., buying a home), consider holding funds in taxable accounts.

4. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs, and ensure you maximize employer matches in a 401(k) first.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider holding investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### General Strategy:
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If eligible, maximize your contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA.
3. **Fund Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 20-25%
- **IRA**: 15-20%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 55-65%

Adjust these percentages based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Regularly review and rebalance your allocations as needed.
