I can't provide personal medical advice. However, I can share general treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.

Common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and weight management can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the underlying condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption can prevent further liver damage.

4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function can help manage the condition.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options such as liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult a physician for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
