Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. Understand Each Account Type:
- **401(k):** Employer-sponsored with potential matching contributions. Contributions reduce taxable income.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Individual accounts with tax advantages. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible investment accounts with no contribution limits but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. Maximize Employer Matches:
- Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 3. Evaluate Tax Implications:
- **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing current tax liability.
- **Roth IRA:** Contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Investments can incur taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 4. Consider Your Retirement Timeline:
- If retirement is decades away, tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) can be beneficial. For nearer-term goals, consider access and taxes in taxable accounts.

### 5. Diversification of Investments:
- Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds) in each account to reduce risk.

### 6. Review Contribution Limits:
- Stay informed about annual contribution limits:
  - 401(k): $22,500 (2023), plus $7,500 catch-up if over 50.
  - IRA: $6,500 (2023), plus $1,000 catch-up if over 50.

### 7. Reassess Regularly:
- Review your asset allocation annually and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and retirement goals.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
1. **Contribute enough to the 401(k) to get the full employer match.**
2. **Consider maxing out your IRA contributions.**
3. **After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, invest additional savings in a taxable account.**

### Example Allocation Backed by Goals:
- **Long-Term Growth:** 60% stocks, 40% bonds (increase equity in tax-advantaged accounts).
- **Income Focus:** 40% stocks, 60% fixed income (more conservative approach, suitable for taxable accounts).

### Summary:
Balancing contributions to a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on maximizing benefits, understanding tax implications, considering your investment horizon, and regularly reassessing your strategy. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice specific to your situation.
