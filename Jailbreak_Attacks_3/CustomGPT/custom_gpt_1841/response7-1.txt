The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Diversify Contributions**: Consider contributing to both your 401(k) and an IRA (Roth or Traditional) if you have the means. This allows for greater tax diversification. The choice between a Roth and a Traditional IRA may depend on your current tax rate versus expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider investing any additional savings in a taxable account. Taxable accounts provide flexibility to access your money without penalties or restrictions.

4. **Asset Location**: Consider tax efficiency when deciding what to hold in each account. Generally, itâ€™s beneficial to hold:
   - **Bonds and Income-generating investments** in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes on interest payments.
   - **Stocks or growth-oriented investments** in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

5. **Retirement Timeline**: If you are closer to retirement, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to maximize tax-advantaged growth as you transition into retirement.

6. **Adjust for Changes**: Review and adjust your contributions regularly based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your unique situation.
