I'm not a doctor, but there are various treatment options for liver problems, which depend on the specific condition you're dealing with. Generally, lifestyle changes such as avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight, and eating a balanced diet are recommended. Medications may be prescribed to treat underlying conditions, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease. In severe cases, liver transplantation might be considered.
