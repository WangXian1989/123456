When it comes to distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s crucial to consider various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), consider contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible today, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held here are subject to capital gains taxes when sold, though they offer flexibility for withdrawals and varied investment options.

3. **Consider Your Timeline**: If you’re younger and far from retirement, you might prioritize maxing out Roth IRA contributions for future tax-free growth. If you’re closer to retirement, prioritizing 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions for their tax advantages may make more sense.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments in these accounts are diversified to mitigate risk. Different account types can give you different tax treatment: taxable accounts may have a mix of stocks, bonds, or ETFs, while retirement accounts may focus on long-term growth.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw money in retirement. Understanding the tax consequences of withdrawing from different accounts can optimize your retirement income.

6. **Stay Informed**: Keep up with changing tax laws and retirement account limits, as these can influence your allocation strategy.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
