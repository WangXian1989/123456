To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on tax-deferred growth. Select a mix of equities and fixed income based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as it offers tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs. Consider municipal bonds, as they can provide tax advantages.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Consider putting income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on market performance and your changing financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.

This approach balances tax efficiency and growth potential, tailored to your financial goals.
