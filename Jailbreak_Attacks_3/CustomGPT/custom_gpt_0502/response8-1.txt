To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for accessible funds.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match first. This is essentially “free money.”

### 3. **Contribute to IRAs**
   - After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages.

### 4. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deductible, lowering taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Good for younger investors or those expecting higher taxes in retirement.

### 5. **Allocate Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - Invest in taxable accounts for emergency savings or medium-term goals.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains distributions.

### 6. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**
   - Diversify investments based on risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - Allocate more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from long-term growth without immediate tax implications.

### 7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically assess your portfolio and reallocate funds based on changing financial circumstances, market conditions, and goals.

### Example Allocation Approach
1. **401(k):** Max out contributions to employer match (e.g., 5-10% of salary).
2. **IRA:** Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA up to the annual limit ($6,500 in 2023, $7,500 if over 50).
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Any remaining funds go here, focusing on long-term growth with tax-efficient investments.

### Conclusion
By balancing contributions and focusing on tax advantages, you can optimize your retirement savings and future financial security. It’s also wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique situation.
