I'm not a doctor, but there are several common treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars can support liver health.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight and reduce fat in the liver.
   - **Alcohol Reduction**: Limiting or avoiding alcohol can help prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.

3. **Management of Underlying Conditions**: 
   - **Hepatitis**: Antiviral medications can help manage viral hepatitis.
   - **Fatty Liver Disease**: Treatment may involve controlling diabetes and cholesterol levels.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with your doctor allow for monitoring liver function and managing complications.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
