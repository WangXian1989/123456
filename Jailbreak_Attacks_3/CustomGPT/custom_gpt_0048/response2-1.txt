Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is effectively “free money.”

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Traditional contributions reduce taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs work similarly to 401(k)s; Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals after retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here incur capital gains taxes when sold, plus dividends are taxed in the year received.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Start with maxing out contributions to your IRA (especially if it’s a Roth) for future tax-free growth.
   - If you exceed IRA limits or want to save more, contribute to your 401(k).

4. **Balance Investments Based on Time Horizon**:
   - In tax-advantaged accounts, consider higher growth investments (stocks) due to long-term nature.
   - In taxable accounts, lean towards income-generating investments (bonds, dividend stocks) to potentially manage taxes more efficiently.

5. **Review Overall Asset Allocation**: Ensure your total portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance and investment strategy. 

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your contributions and investment allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

7. **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: In taxable accounts, you can offset capital gains with losses, reducing your overall tax liability.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
