Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start with your 401(k). If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”it's essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Consider contributing up to the annual limit.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.
   
3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth investments, like stocks or index funds.
   - In taxable accounts, consider more tax-efficient investments (like ETFs or municipal bonds) to manage capital gains.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside these accounts, ideally covering 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Balance Taxes**: Be strategic about withdrawals. Taxable accounts are generally best for short-term needs, while retirement accounts are for long-term growth. Consider how distributions will affect your tax bracket in retirement.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustment**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on market conditions, tax laws, and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your individual circumstances.
