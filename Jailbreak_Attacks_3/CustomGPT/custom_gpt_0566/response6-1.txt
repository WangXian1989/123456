When considering the optimal distribution of your assets among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some strategic approaches:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." The contribution limits for 2023 are $22,500 (or $30,000 for those aged 50 and older).
   - **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older). A Roth IRA is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may appreciate over time and are less tax-efficient, like stocks. This strategy optimizes the favorable long-term capital gains tax rates.
   - **Consider Capital Gains**: If you are in a lower tax bracket, realizing capital gains in a taxable account may reduce your overall tax burden.

### 3. Diversification and Risk Management
   - **Asset Allocation**: Balance your portfolio based on your risk tolerance. Generally, equities can provide higher long-term returns, while bonds and cash can offer stability.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly monitor and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, which may change due to market fluctuations.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively distribute your assets among these accounts to help optimize your financial growth while taking full advantage of tax benefits.
