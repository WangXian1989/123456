Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key considerations for each:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Contribution Limits**: Max out your 401(k) contributions if possible, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.
- **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are typically pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or post-tax (Roth 401(k)), which can influence your current and future tax situation.
- **Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment choices available in your 401(k) plan and their fees.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
- **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) and a Roth IRA (taxed contributions, tax-free withdrawals). Your current and expected future tax rates should guide this decision.
- **Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500, or $7,500 if youâ€™re age 50 or older.
- **Investment Flexibility**: IRAs often provide a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices without retirement account penalties.
- **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider strategies such as tax loss harvesting to minimize your tax burden.
- **Investment Time Horizon**: Invest in less volatile or tax-efficient assets (like index funds) if you expect to use these funds in the near term.

### General Strategy:
1. **Max Out Retirement Accounts**: Prioritize maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.
2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing heavily in taxable accounts.
3. **Diversification**: Allocate a mix of equities, bonds, and other asset classes across all account types based on your risk tolerance and investment timeframe.
4. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in income, or shifts in your financial goals.
