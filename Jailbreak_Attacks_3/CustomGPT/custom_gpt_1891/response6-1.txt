Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Timeline:** Consider how soon you plan to retire. This affects your investment strategy.
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Factor in any short-term financial needs that may require quick access to cash.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):**
     - If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money.
     - Aim to maximize your annual contribution limit ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA:**
     - Consider making contributions to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. 
     - The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older) for 2024.
     
### 3. **Allocate Remaining Funds to Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you've maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use leftover funds for taxable accounts.
   - Focus on investments that have favorable tax implications, like long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation:**
     - Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance. 
   - **Account-Level Strategies:**
     - Hold high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes on growth.
     - Use your taxable account for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds).

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - It may be beneficial to work with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.

By carefully evaluating your options and goals, you can develop a balanced strategy that maximizes your investment growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
