Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment preferences. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching. Contributions are tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Similar tax benefits as a 401(k). Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages but offer flexibility for withdrawals. Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxable.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After securing the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you can choose between a traditional and Roth IRA based on your current tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you've maximized contributions to benefit from tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across accounts. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** 
     - Generally, place investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts.
     - Put investments with high growth potential (like stocks) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Current Tax Bracket:** Higher contributions to tax-deferred accounts might benefit you if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Future Tax Considerations:** Roth IRA contributions can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to increase in the future.

### 5. **Regular Review:**
   - Monitor your investment performance and reallocate assets as needed due to market changes or shifts in your financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out the 401(k)** up to the match limit (e.g., 6% of salary).
- **Contribute to an IRA** up to the annual limit, choosing between traditional or Roth based on your current tax situation.
- **Contribute to a taxable account** after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, especially for liquidity and flexibility.

### Conclusion:
Each person’s situation is unique, so it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific needs and goals.
