Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be strategic, depending on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match first, if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Maximize contributions based on IRS limits ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if over age 50).

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** Decide whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes on withdrawals) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth, tax-free withdrawals) fits your tax strategy.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Contribute up to the limit ($6,500 for 2024, or $7,500 if over age 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for money you may need in the short to medium term, as they are more liquid and accessible without tax penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on holding investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

### General Strategy
1. **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with the 401(k) to capture employer matches, then max out an IRA before investing in taxable accounts.
2. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investment choices in each account align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, more aggressive growth investments may go in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments can occupy taxable accounts.
3. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals and capital gains. Position higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax benefits.

### Regular Reviews
- Reassess your distribution strategy annually and make adjustments based on changes in income, expenses, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice that's specific to your circumstances and goals.
