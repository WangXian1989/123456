Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Retirement Accounts**:
   - After getting the employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (both Traditional and Roth IRAs if eligible) to benefit from tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Deferred Accounts**:
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts like a Traditional 401(k) or IRA. 

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This provides flexibility and access to funds without penalties if needed before retirement.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments according to your risk tolerance. Generally, stocks can provide growth but come with volatility, while bonds may offer more stability but lower returns.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions, maintaining your desired risk level.

7. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of tax implications for withdrawals. For example, capital gains from taxable investments could be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income from 401(k) or IRA withdrawals.

8. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund in a separate account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

9. **Consult a Financial Adviser**:
   - If uncertain, consider consulting a financial adviser to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific financial situation.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of income (up to employer match)
- **IRA**: Max out contributions ($6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 for those 50+) 
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings after reaching retirement account limits

This approach can help ensure a balanced and tax-efficient distribution of your money across these different types of accounts.
