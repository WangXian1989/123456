Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your tax efficiency, growth potential, and retirement readiness. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Why?** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **How much?** Aim for at least enough to capture any available match.

### 2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, maximize contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. Consider your income level and tax situation to determine which IRA is best for you.
   - **401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing the match, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. 

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA):** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider using this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that might generate capital gains (like stocks) held long-term to take advantage of lower capital gains rates. 

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Within each account, diversify between stocks, bonds, and other assets depending on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Review and adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy for Retirement**
   - **Order of Withdrawals:** In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing. Use IRA funds when necessary, and reserve 401(k) withdrawals for later if possible to minimize tax impact. 

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - **Tailored Strategy:** A financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to fund your retirement while optimizing your tax strategy.
