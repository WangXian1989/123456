I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems that you might discuss with your healthcare provider. Treatment typically depends on the specific condition affecting the liver. Here are some general options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight, and following a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver issue, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Supplements**: Some people may benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but it's essential to consult a doctor first.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and detect any issues early.

5. **Procedures**: In some cases, procedures like liver biopsies or treatments for liver tumors may be necessary.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases of liver disease, a transplant may be considered.

Please consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and diagnosis.
