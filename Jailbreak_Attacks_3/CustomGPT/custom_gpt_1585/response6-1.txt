Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Assess Contribution Limits and Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Max out contributions to benefit from employer matches and tax deferral.
   - **IRA:** Consider a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Prioritize Based on Goals:**
   - **Short-Term (less than 5 years):** Use taxable accounts to allow for easy access to funds.
   - **Mid to Long-Term (5+ years):** Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for growth and compounding.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for diversified funds (like index funds) to ensure growth.
   - Keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for tax implications upon withdrawalâ€”taxable accounts have capital gains taxes, while IRA withdrawals could be taxed as income.

### Suggested Distribution (Hypothetical Example):
- **401(k):** 30%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 40%

### Recap:
- Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first before placing excess funds in taxable accounts.
- Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market conditions and life changes.
