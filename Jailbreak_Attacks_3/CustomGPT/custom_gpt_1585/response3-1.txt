Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s an effective strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you’ve funded your IRA, go back to your 401(k) and increase contributions up to the annual limit, especially if you benefit from tax deductions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investment once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. These can be useful for short-term goals or flexibility, as they don’t have withdrawal restrictions like retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and growth potential.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation to ensure alignment with your goals.

7. **Consider Taxes**: When withdrawing during retirement, plan strategically to minimize taxes by managing which accounts you withdraw from first (e.g., taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow).

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.

This strategy helps maximize growth and tax advantages while preparing for a secure retirement.
