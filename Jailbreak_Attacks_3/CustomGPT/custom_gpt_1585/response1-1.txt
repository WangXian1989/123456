Distributing your money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match firstâ€”it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (or after-tax for Roth). This can reduce your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals later (except Roth).
   - **IRA**: Similar tax treatment to 401(k) for traditional IRAs. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, so consider your future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are flexible but don't have the same tax advantages. Earnings are taxed annually, so these may be better for short-term goals.

3. **Balance Contributions**: 
   - Prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions if possible.
   - If you hit the contribution limits, allocate excess savings to taxable accounts for flexibility.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Place growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes on gains.
   - Consider holding income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocation based on life changes, market conditions, and shifts in your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring a strategy to your specific situation might benefit from professional advice.

This combination of strategies can help you optimize your tax exposure and achieve your retirement goals effectively.
