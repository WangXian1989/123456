The best way to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: If you have maxed out the employer match, consider contributing to the IRS limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA can provide tax benefits. The choice between a Roth and traditional IRA depends on your current tax rate versus what you expect it to be in retirement.
   
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. Keep in mind that investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**: Consider placing more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments to ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Consider Withdrawals in Retirement**: Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it's advised to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s) and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan based on your personal circumstances.
