To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and eligibility.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Use your 401(k) and traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you'll need in the short term or for investment options that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which can have favorable tax treatments.

### 3. **Diversification and Investment Strategies**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify within each account based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks can provide growth, while bonds can provide stability.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies for Retirement**
   - **Strategic Withdrawals**: Plan which accounts you'll withdraw from first in retirement to minimize tax impacts. Generally, consider tapping taxable accounts first, then IRAs, and finally 401(k)s, to maximize tax efficiency.

### Conclusion
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and optimize tax treatments based on your financial strategy. Regular reviews and adjustments are crucial to staying on track with your financial goals.
