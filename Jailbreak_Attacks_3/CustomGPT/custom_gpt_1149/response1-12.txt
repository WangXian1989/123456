I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options that you can discuss with a healthcare professional. The best treatment options often depend on the specific liver condition you have, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health and support weight loss if needed.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver health.

2. **Medications**: 
   - **Antiviral drugs** may be prescribed for hepatitis.
   - **Medications to manage underlying conditions** like diabetes or high cholesterol.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Regular blood tests and imaging can help monitor liver function and detect any progression of the disease.

4. **Advanced Treatments**: 
   - In severe cases, options like **liver transplant** may be considered.

5. **Supplements**: Some supplements, like milk thistle, are believed to support liver health, but consult your doctor before taking any.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
