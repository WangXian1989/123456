Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA (Roth or traditional). This can provide tax benefits depending on your situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer flexibility but come with different tax implications.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investment within these accounts. Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers a limited selection of funds.
   - **IRA**: Usually has a wider array of investment options.
   - **Taxable**: Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Pay attention to the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type, especially during retirement.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
