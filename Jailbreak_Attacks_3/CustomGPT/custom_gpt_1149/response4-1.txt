Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA after securing your employer match. IRAs often offer more investment options than 401(k)s.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers pre-tax contributions, which reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with post-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains and dividends are taxed in the year they are realized. Consider using these for more flexible investing, especially if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified across all accounts. Your asset allocation may vary between accounts depending on their tax treatments.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Generally, you should withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally from tax-free accounts.

6. **Investment Choices**: Choose investments wisely in each account. For example, consider holding bonds in your 401(k) or IRA (to defer taxes) and equities in your taxable accounts (to benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes).

7. **Regular Reassessment**: Periodically review your contributions and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this distribution strategy to your specific circumstances.
