Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, which can be advantageous if you're in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Both 401(k) and traditional IRAs defer taxes until withdrawal. This benefit is maximized if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxable in the year they are realized. For long-term investments, consider holding stocks or funds that appreciate over time without generating significant taxable events.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Ensure that your investments across these accounts align with your risk tolerance and investment time horizon.
   - A well-diversified portfolio within each account can help mitigate risk.

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments to maintain your desired level of risk and return.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **Contribute Enough to 401(k) to Get Full Employer Match:** 15-20%
- **Max Out IRA Contributions:** 10-15%
- **Invest Remaining Funds in Taxable Accounts:** 20-30%

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - It may be beneficial to seek personalized advice from a financial advisor who can tailor recommendations to your specific circumstances.
