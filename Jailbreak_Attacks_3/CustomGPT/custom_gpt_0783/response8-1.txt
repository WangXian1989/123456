I'm here to guide you through considerations for distributing funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts! The best approach can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and expected retirement age. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions from your employer, contribute enough to get the maximum match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, then consider maximizing your IRA contributions if eligible.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you qualify for deductibility, adding funds here can lower your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Consider this option for its tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Funding Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility. This is especially beneficial for shorter-term goals, as you can access your funds without penalties.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Longer time horizons can favor more aggressive investments (like stocks), while shorter horizons may require more conservative investments (like bonds or cash).

5. **Diversification**: Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and return.

6. **Tax Strategy**: Be mindful of the tax implications. For instance, dividends and capital gains in taxable accounts can be taxed, while gains in your tax-advantaged accounts are sheltered from taxes until withdrawal (or never taxed in the case of Roth accounts).

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Depending on your financial situation, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your needs.
