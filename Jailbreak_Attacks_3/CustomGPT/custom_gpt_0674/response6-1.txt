I'm not a financial advisor, but I can offer some general strategies that individuals often consider when it comes to distributing funds among retirement and taxable accounts. Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now, but distributions in retirement will be taxed at ordinary income rates.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax implications as a 401(k) for traditional IRAs. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement if rules are followed.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Investment income, such as dividends and capital gains, will be taxed annually, so consider the tax efficiency of your investments here.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Allocate funds based on your retirement timeline and risk tolerance. Younger investors may opt for more equities in tax-advantaged accounts, recognizing a longer time horizon for growth.
   - Diversify your investments. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account, tailoring the allocation to the account's tax treatment.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Maximize contributions to these accounts if possible, especially if employer matching is available in your 401(k).

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when you'll withdraw funds in retirement. This can influence how you allocate your investments now. For instance, you may want to prioritize tax-deferred accounts for long-term growth to minimize immediate tax impacts.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your distribution based on performance and changing financial goals. 

Ultimately, it's important to tailor your approach to your individual financial situation and long-term goals. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
