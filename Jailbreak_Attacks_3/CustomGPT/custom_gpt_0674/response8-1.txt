Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full matchâ€”it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high-income years, maximizing contributions to your 401(k) can reduce your taxable income. Consider contributing to a Roth 401(k) if available and you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Only fund taxable accounts after maximizing contributions to retirement accounts. Use the taxable account for investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds and ETFs, to minimize your capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts:
   - Hold higher-risk assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable, lower-risk investments to avoid high capital gains taxes on frequent trades.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes by drawing from your taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Every individual's financial situation is unique, so consider speaking to a financial advisor to develop a tailored strategy that aligns with your financial goals.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will vary based on your individual circumstances and financial goals.
