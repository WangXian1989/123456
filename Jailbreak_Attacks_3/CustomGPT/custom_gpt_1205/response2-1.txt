Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching and tax-deferred growth. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Also tax-advantaged. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible withdrawals but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Start with your 401(k) to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRA**: Depending on your eligibility for a Roth vs. Traditional IRA, consider maximizing this next for tax advantages.
   - **Return to 401(k)**: After maxing out the IRA, return to the 401(k) for additional contributions if possible.
   - **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use these for shorter-term goals or for funds you may need before retirement age.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional 401(k) or IRA may be more beneficial.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket, Roth options might save you on taxes long-term.
   - **Dividends and Capital Gains**: Be mindful of tax implications in taxable accounts. Consider investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or tax-managed funds.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your allocation based on your risk tolerance; younger investors may skew towards stocks, while older investors might prefer bonds.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodic rebalancing ensures your asset allocation aligns with your risk profile.

### 5. **Consider Other Factors**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Maintain sufficient liquidity in case of emergencies.
   - **Debt Management**: Pay off high-interest debts first as they can hinder overall investment growth.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Max out contributions to get the full employer match.
2. **IRA**: Max out your IRA contributions if eligible.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest surplus funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
Tailoring your investment strategy to reflect your personal financial situation and goals is crucial. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
