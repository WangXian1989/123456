Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for goals outside retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & Traditional IRA)**: You’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay capital gains tax on profits when you sell investments.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compounding without immediate tax implications.
   - **Bonds/Fixed Income**: Consider holding these in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing in any of these accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation to align with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice based on your specific situation, it’s wise to speak with a financial advisor.

This balanced approach allows you to leverage the benefits of each account type while working toward your financial goals.
