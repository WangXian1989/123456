To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic steps:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match:** Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages. Roth IRAs are ideal for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar tax treatment to 401(k) but may have different eligibility criteria based on income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment gains are taxed at capital gains rates, which can be more favorable than ordinary income tax rates if held long-term.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts.
   - Consider how each account type contributes to your overall asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.).

### 4. **Liquidity Needs**
   - Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for immediate withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals.
   - Keep emergency funds separate from these accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your allocations annually to maintain your desired risk level and adjust as needed.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive the full employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out Roth IRA contributions if eligible.
- **Taxable Account:** Allocate additional funds for investments not covered by tax-advantaged accounts.

Adjust these strategies based on your current financial situation, tax bracket, and retirement goals.
