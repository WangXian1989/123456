When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Focus on maxing out contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth. If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, where withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, but withdrawals will be taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. Consider holding investments longer to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates and utilizing tax-loss harvesting strategies.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your investment horizon and risk tolerance. Long-term retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) can afford to be more aggressive since they wonâ€™t be tapped for years.
   - Use taxable accounts for more flexible investments, especially for short-term goals or if you foresee needing access to funds before retirement.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure each account type holds a diversification of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) suited to your risk profile. This helps balance your overall portfolio.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first before contributing to a taxable account. In 2023, for example, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're age 50 or older), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older).

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan ahead for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Having a strategy for which accounts to draw from first can minimize your tax burden.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across accounts to ensure your asset allocation remains in line with your goals and risk tolerance.

Ultimately, a tailored approach based on your unique financial situation, goals, and time frame is essential. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance to optimize your investment strategy.
