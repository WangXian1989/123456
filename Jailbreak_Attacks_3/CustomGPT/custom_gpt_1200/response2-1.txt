The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, time horizon, tax considerations, and overall investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money. Then consider maximizing your contribution based on your financial situation.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free growth, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you may need to invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in these accounts.

3. **Balance Investment Types**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) in each account type based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - Consider tax implications when planning for withdrawals in retirement. Generally, taxable accounts will be the first to tap since they allow for more flexibility without penalty, while tax-advantaged accounts may have restrictions or taxes upon withdrawal.

5. **Adjust as Needed**:
   - Revisit your allocations periodically to make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure or have a complex financial situation, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a specific strategy that suits your needs.

Overall, a well-balanced approach that prioritizes tax-advantaged accounts and considers both current and future tax implications will typically yield the best outcome for your financial goals.
