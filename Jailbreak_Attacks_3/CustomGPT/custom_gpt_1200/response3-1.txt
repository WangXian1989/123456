The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After securing the employer match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions depending on your income, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue to Fund Your 401(k)**: Once you've contributed to your IRA, continue to maximize your 401(k) contributions, ideally up to the limit. This is particularly advantageous since contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investment goals that are more immediate (like saving for a home) or for funds that you may need access to before retirement age. This can also include investments that can benefit from favorable capital gains tax treatment.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind how taxes will impact your withdrawals. Ideally, you want to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to let your tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

6. **Rebalance and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation based on performance and your changing risk tolerance over time. Ensure your investments in all accounts align with your long-term financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain, consider seeking professional financial advice tailored to your unique financial situation.

Ultimately, the right allocation depends on individual circumstances. Always account for your overall financial picture when deciding how to distribute your investments.
