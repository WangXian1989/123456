Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement strategy. Here are some key considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: 401(k) plans have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs, so if you can afford to, prioritize this account until you hit the maximum limit.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Tax Deduction**: Depending on your income and whether you have access to a 401(k), contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.
   - **Tax-Free Growth**: If you choose a Roth IRA, your contributions grow tax-free, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free if certain conditions are met. Consider your expected tax bracket in retirement when deciding between a Traditional and a Roth IRA.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the lower contribution limits compared to a 401(k) and allocate accordingly.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Management**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) which can minimize capital gains taxes, and utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies if applicable.

### Recommended Strategy:
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start with enough contributions to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA, particularly a Roth IRA if you qualify for one, for added tax advantages.
3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've funded your IRA adequately, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions up to the limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for any additional savings, especially if you have mid-term goals (such as buying a home or travel) that are outside your retirement horizon.

### Final Thoughts:
- **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so it's a good idea to review your allocation periodically.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain of how to balance these accounts based on your specific situation, consider seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor.

By carefully considering these factors and strategically allocating your funds, you can maximize your retirement savings while enjoying flexibility for your current financial needs.
