Distributing money between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of that match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. After that, consider increasing your contributions to maximize your annual limit ($19,500 in 2021, or $26,000 if you're over age 50).
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. A Traditional IRA may offer you a tax deduction, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: 
   - **Tax Deferral**: Funds in 401(k)s and traditional IRAs grow tax-deferred, while withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this can be beneficial.
   - **Tax-Free Growth**: Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you're eligible; it's wise to consider this option if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investment choices but have tax implications for dividends and capital gains.
   - Capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed more favorably than ordinary income, so consider holding investments for over a year to qualify for long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Diversification and Risk Assessment**: 
   - Ensure that across all accounts, your investments are diversified to spread risk. Adjust your allocations based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and timeframe until retirement.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: 
   - Periodically review and rebalance your accounts to align with your investment strategy and financial goals as life circumstances change.

It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy based on your specific financial situation.
