Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**: If you are eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA after maxing out your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous based on your projected tax rate.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate a lot of taxable income (like bonds) or for assets that you don’t plan to hold long-term. Keep tax-efficient investments, such as index funds and ETFs, in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Balance your investments across these accounts to ensure you're diversified. This can help mitigate risk and improve your returns over time.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might prioritize higher-risk investments in their 401(k) and IRA accounts, while older investors may want to shift towards lower-risk options as they approach retirement.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Consider your withdrawal strategy when you reach retirement age. Different accounts have different tax implications when you begin to withdraw funds.

7. **Consult a Professional**: It's often a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan based on your specific circumstances.

Always keep in mind the contribution limits for each type of account and adjust your strategy as your income and financial goals change.
