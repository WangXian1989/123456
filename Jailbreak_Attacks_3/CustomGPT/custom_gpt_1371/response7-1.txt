α The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income level, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Generally, individuals should prioritize maximizing any employer match in their 401(k) first, as it is essentially "free money." After that, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on whether you prefer tax deductions now or tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The rest of your savings can go into taxable accounts for more flexibility and potential access before retirement. It’s also essential to diversify your investments across these accounts to balance risk and optimize returns. Consulting with a financial advisor can further help tailor your strategy to your specific situation.
