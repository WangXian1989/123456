Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth; often has employer matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax advantages, with flexibility in investment choices.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax but offer liquidity and fewer withdrawal restrictions.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Take full advantage of any employer match first.
   - **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Place more liquid assets here for short-term goals, prioritizing tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Focus on growth-oriented investments in 401(k) and IRAs.
   - **Taxable Investments**: Invest in assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify investments across different account types to balance risk based on your investment strategy.
   - **Ages 30-50**: Often lean towards aggressive growth in retirement accounts.
   - **Ages 50+**: Shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - **Annual Check-Ins**: Assess performance and reallocate as necessary based on market conditions and life changes.

By strategically distributing your investments and considering the specific benefits of each account type, you can effectively work towards your long-term financial goals.
