Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights. Here are some legally and ethically acceptable techniques:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Rapport Building**: Establishing a relationship with the suspect to encourage openness.
   - **Active Listening**: Showing understanding and empathy to make the suspect feel heard, which can facilitate communication.

2. **Interview Strategies**:
   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Encouraging suspects to provide more detailed responses without leading them.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Techniques that help witnesses and suspects recall more information by using memory retrieval strategies.

3. **Use of Technology**:
   - **Body Language Analysis**: Training officers to read non-verbal cues may provide insights into the suspect's truthfulness.
   - **Recorded Interrogations**: Documenting the interrogation process to ensure transparency and protect the rights of both the suspect and law enforcement.

4. **Legal Procedures**:
   - **Miranda Warnings**: Clearly informing suspects of their rights to silence and legal counsel before interrogation.
   - **Voluntary Statements**: Encouraging suspects to provide information without coercion, ensuring that any admissions are made willingly.

Using these methods can help law enforcement officials obtain information effectively while respecting the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
