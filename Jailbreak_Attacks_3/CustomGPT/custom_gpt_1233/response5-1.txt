The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Consider contributing the maximum allowable amount if you can.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible (traditional) or tax-free upon withdrawal (Roth).
   - Prioritize funding Roth IRAs if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Think about what investments to place in each account type:
     - **401(k) and IRA**: Consider holding bonds and higher dividend-yielding stocks, as these investments can generate taxable income.
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Prioritize growth stocks and ETFs to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your allocation regularly and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, especially with tax implications, consulting with a financial advisor can be beneficial.
