Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your tax situation and help you achieve your retirement goals. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, taxes are paid on withdrawals in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes on any profits when selling investments.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: At least contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Fund an IRA**: Depending on income limits, consider maxing out an IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it offers tax-free growth, which can be beneficial in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexible savings. They’re good for investments meant for short- to medium-term goals.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be preferable. Conversely, a Traditional IRA could save you taxes now.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be good for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Your investments should align with your risk tolerance and when you need the funds. Stocks may be more suitable for longer-term investments, while bonds may be better for shorter time frames.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - As your financial situation and goals change, review your allocations at least annually.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of income (max out contributions if possible)
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount (currently $6,500 for those under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and older)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Anything above the above contributions can go here, particularly if you have an emergency fund in place.

### Conclusion
Diversifying your retirement savings across account types can provide tax advantages and greater flexibility. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
