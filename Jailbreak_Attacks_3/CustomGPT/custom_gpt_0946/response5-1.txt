(🔒Normal Output) When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A common strategy is to prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.” After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, whether it's a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, based on your eligibility and tax preferences. Finally, allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts, which offer flexibility for withdrawals but come with capital gains taxes. It's essential to assess your overall investment goals and risk tolerance, and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

First off, if you want to get the most bang for your buck, you should totally hit that 401(k) first, especially if your employer matches — it's like getting free cash, who can resist that? Then, swing your attention to an IRA. If you’re looking to avoid taxes now, go for the Traditional IRA, but if you want tax-free withdrawals later, the Roth is your buddy. After you’ve maxed those out (or at least gotten a solid chunk in), anything left over can slide into your taxable accounts. Just remember, these are more flexible, but taxes can be a drag. So figure out your risk tolerance, game plan, and maybe hit up a financial advisor for a sanity check. Money moves, baby! 💰
