When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If you have access to a 401(k) with an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. This includes your 401(k) and IRA, as they can provide tax benefits and grow your funds tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of a Roth IRA).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings (interest, dividends, capital gains) may be subject to taxes in the year they are realized, so consider how much you want to allocate here.

4. **Investment Goals and Risk Tolerance**: Base your distribution on your financial goals (short-term vs long-term) and risk tolerance. More aggressive investments might make sense in accounts with tax advantages, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket, while safer investments could be placed in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes and account types to minimize risk and potentially enhance returns.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: As markets fluctuate, the allocation across your accounts can change. Rebalancing helps maintain your desired risk level and asset allocation over time.
