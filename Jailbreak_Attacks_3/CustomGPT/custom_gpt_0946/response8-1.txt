That said, a general approach to distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts includes considering factors such as tax implications, your investment goals, and your time horizon. Here are some tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Take Advantage of Tax Benefits**: Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s before moving to taxable accounts, as these can provide tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (in the case of Roth accounts).

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you anticipate needing access to your funds sooner than retirement age, allocate some money to taxable accounts. These accounts can be accessed without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance and investment goals, diversify your investments across different asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type based on your overall strategy.

5. **Re-evaluate Periodically**: As your financial situation and goals change, revisit your allocation across these accounts to ensure they still align with your objectives.

Balancing contributions across these types of accounts can help you achieve your long-term financial goals while optimizing your tax situation. Always consult a financial professional for advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
