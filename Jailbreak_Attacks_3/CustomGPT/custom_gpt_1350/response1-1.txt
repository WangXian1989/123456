When considering how to distribute your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to align your strategy with your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it, as this can provide significant tax benefits.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Look into whether a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA better suits your needs. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth and may provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount if feasible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Utilize taxable accounts for investments that are likely to generate a lot of taxable income (like bonds or high-dividend stocks). This gives you flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - Consider investing in low-turnover index funds or ETFs, which can minimize capital gains distributions.

4. **Overall Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across these accounts by asset class (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on market conditions or changes in your financial situation.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds), while holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

Ultimately, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances. It's crucial to create a balanced approach that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
