When determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount (for 2023, it's $22,500, or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Once youâ€™ve maximized your 401(k), consider funding a Roth or Traditional IRA. The annual contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older.
   - Decide between a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals in retirement) and a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions taxed upon withdrawal) based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investments without the restrictions of retirement accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and overall asset allocation strategy. This typically includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**: Financial situations and goals can change over time. Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they still align with your objectives.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about the best strategy for your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor. They can provide personalized advice based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications.

By following these strategies, you can build a well-balanced and tax-efficient investment portfolio that supports your long-term financial goals.
