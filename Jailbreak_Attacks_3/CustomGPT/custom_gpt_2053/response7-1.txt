Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider funding an IRA (Traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA, consider increasing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you have high income and want to lower your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for greater flexibility. These can be useful for short-term goals or if you plan on early withdrawals.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to mitigate risk.

6. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: Be aware of the tax implications for withdrawals. IRAs and 401(k)s may have penalties for early withdrawal, while taxable accounts do not. 

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically, adjusting as your income, expenses, and financial goals change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your specific situation.
