Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, tax situation, and financial goals. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After reaching the match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Continue with Your 401(k)**: Once you've maxed out contributions to the IRA (up to the annual limit), continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you still have additional funds after maxing out your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These are useful for short-term goals or retirement funds beyond what you can hold in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance. Generally, you might want to place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts, while more stable investments (like bonds) can go into taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

It can also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
