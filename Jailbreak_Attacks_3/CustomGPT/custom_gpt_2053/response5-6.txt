First, leveraging social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat is crucial, as these are where young people spend their time. Engaging content that resonates with their interestsâ€”such as social justice, climate change, and education reformâ€”can capture their attention. Additionally, incorporating influencers and peer networks can enhance reach and authenticity. Events, both virtual and in-person, that allow for direct interaction with candidates or issues can also motivate young voters to participate.
