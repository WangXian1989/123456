I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, antiviral medications for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases, or medications to manage symptoms may be prescribed.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly impact liver health.

3. **Weight Management**: For non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), losing weight can help reduce fat accumulation.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and detect any worsening of the condition.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplantation may be considered.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
