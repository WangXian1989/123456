Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's free money. Consider maximizing contributions if you can, as they reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Debt and Emergency Fund Considerations**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund and pay down high-interest debt before heavily investing.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term goals or to hold investments that generate capital gains or income. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize tax liability.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and market changes.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Ultimately, the allocation should align with your long-term financial goals and keep in mind the distinction between tax implications and investment horizons for each account type.
