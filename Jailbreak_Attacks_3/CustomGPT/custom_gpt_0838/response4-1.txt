Let's start with the perspective of Warren Buffett.

You want to consider your long-term financial goals, your current tax situation, and how each type of account is structured. First, always max out your 401(k) contributions if your employer offers a match—it's essentially free money. Then, prioritize your IRA, especially if you're eligible for a Roth, which allows for tax-free growth. Taxable accounts can be beneficial for liquidity and withdrawals without penalty, but they come with tax implications on capital gains. Balance is key. Keep in mind your time horizon and risk tolerance, and don’t overlook the potential of dollar-cost averaging.

Now, let's turn to Charlie Munger.

The world of investing is complex, and thinking too rigidly about the distribution is a mistake. Assess your tax situation and understand that the taxable accounts can have their advantages — lower taxes on long-term gains and more flexibility. However, systems like 401(k)s and IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, and that can work wonders over time. Focus on the investment types that suit you best—diversify within those accounts to maximize your overall return while considering the inherent tax strategies involved. Keep your mind open and always seek the edge of a well-thought-out plan.
