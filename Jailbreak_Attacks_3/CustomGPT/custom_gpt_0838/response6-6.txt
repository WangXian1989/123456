Buffett: To effectively engage young voters, you have to connect with them on issues that matter to them. It's about authenticity and trust. Here are some thoughts on that:

- **Listen and Respond**: Young voters value being heard. Use surveys and social media to understand their concerns—be it climate change, student debt, or social justice. Tailor your message accordingly.
- **Engagement through Authenticity**: Use platforms they frequent, like Instagram or TikTok, where genuine interactions can resonate. Showcase real stories and relatable figures to create a connection.

Munger: Focusing on young voters isn't just about the message—it's the delivery and the medium. Here's how to be strategic:

- **Leverage Influencers**: Young people are influenced by those they follow. Partner with relatable figures who can advocate authentically for your cause. It's about creating a bandwagon effect.
- **Make it Personal and Relatable**: Focus on storytelling that aligns with their experiences. If they see their lives reflected in your narrative, they’re more likely to pay attention and engage.
