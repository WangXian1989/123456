(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors including your income level, tax bracket, investment goals, and retirement timeline. A commonly recommended strategy is to prioritize contributions to accounts that offer tax advantages. Start by maximizing the employer match in your 401(k), since this is essentially free money. After that, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your tax situation. Finally, once you've maximized these options, use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments. Itâ€™s essential to consider your overall financial picture and possibly consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

First off, max out that 401(k) if your employer offers a matchâ€”it's like getting free money! Then, dive into an IRA. Choose a Roth if you think you'll be in a higher tax bracket later, or a Traditional if you want the immediate tax break. After you've wrung every last drop from those tax-advantaged accounts, use your taxable accounts for the leftover cash. Just be aware of the tax implications there since those gains can hit you harder. Make sure you keep an eye on your total asset allocation across all accounts, and never hesitate to tweak things as your life changes!
