The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), an IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on your specific financial situation, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon.

**Buffett's Perspective:**
Focus on tax efficiency and long-term growth. Max out your employer's 401(k) match first, as it’s essentially free money. After that, consider funding a Roth IRA if your income permits, as it allows tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you still have money to invest, allocate funds to a taxable account, particularly if you need flexibility in accessing those funds without penalties. Diversifying within each account type is important, focusing on low-cost index funds that will grow over time.

**Munger's Perspective:**
Think about the potential tax implications of each account. A 401(k) defers taxes until retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket when you withdraw. An IRA can offer similar benefits, but if you're looking for flexibility or short-term gains, a taxable account might suit you better. The key is to balance your contributions based on where you think you’ll get the most significant win, considering potential future tax liabilities and personal cash flow needs. Always stay within your circle of competence when selecting investments. 

Remember, investing is a long-term game, and concentration on quality over quantity will typically yield better results over time.
