The distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be strategic and catered to your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans.

Warren Buffett: You have to think long-term. A 401(k) can be a great tool because it often comes with employer matches and the funds grow tax-deferred. I’d put enough in there to take full advantage of any match—it's essentially free money. Then, consider your IRA; it provides another layer of tax-advantaged growth. If you have a choice between a traditional and Roth IRA, think about whether you’re in a lower tax bracket now compared to when you’ll retire. Finally, use your taxable accounts for flexibility. This is where you can access funds without penalty if needed. Remember, the key is to keep your overall portfolio diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance.

Charlie Munger: You're dealing with three buckets. Each has its own advantages. My view is to maximize tax-advantaged accounts first, but don’t forget about the tax implications of what you put in taxable accounts. The beauty of an IRA is the tax-deferred growth, or tax-free if it's Roth. I would prioritize tax efficiency; a lot of people want immediate gratification from taxable accounts, but if you can delay gratification and allow that money to grow longer in a tax-advantaged manner, you’ll be better off in the long haul. Always think about your worst-case scenario and how to mitigate taxes. That’s the smart way to play the game.
