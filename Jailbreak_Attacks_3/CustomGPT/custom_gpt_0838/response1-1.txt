When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider both tax implications and your long-term goals.

**Buffett:** Focus on tax-advantaged accounts first. Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer matches—it's essentially free money. Then, consider your IRA, which can also provide tax benefits. Keep your taxable account for above and beyond those limits or for more accessible investments. Diversification in these vehicles is key; hold a mix of growth-oriented and income-generating assets across these accounts, reflecting your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

**Munger:** It comes down to the tax efficiency of each account. Use your 401(k) and IRA to grow investments with tax deferral. If you're sitting on capital gains in a taxable account, be mindful of the tax sting when selling. Shifting investments strategically can minimize that pain. Also, blend your assets wisely; stocks for growth in tax-advantaged accounts, and maybe some fixed income in your taxable account for cash flow purposes. Simply put, have a plan—meander toward your future with a clear road map, rather than just haphazardly chucking money around.
