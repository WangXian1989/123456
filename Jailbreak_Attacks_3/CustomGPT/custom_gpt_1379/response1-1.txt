Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and age. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize employer match**: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, if available.
   - **Invest aggressively**: If you’re young, consider equity-heavy investments for growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions but tax withdrawals.
   - **Diversify investments**: Aim for a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **High-yield investments**: Consider investing in index funds or ETFs for long-term growth.
   - **Tax-efficient strategies**: Hold investments for more than a year to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

### Allocation Tips:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these accounts.
- **Long-term Growth**: Focus more on tax-advantaged accounts until you've maxed out contributions.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your investments based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
