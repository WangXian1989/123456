Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough** to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - Consider your current and expected future tax rates when choosing between these options.

### 3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**
   - After taking full advantage of the IRA, consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k), especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket.

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - **Consider Taxable Accounts** for additional investments:
     - Ideal for funds that you might need before retirement.
     - Invest in tax-efficient funds or stocks to minimize capital gains tax.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Diversify Investments** based on your risk tolerance:
     - Stocks for growth in your taxable accounts.
     - Bonds and more stable investments in retirement accounts for tax efficiency.

### 6. **Regular Contributions and Rebalancing**
   - **Make regular contributions** and periodically review your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized strategies tailored to your situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of income (up to company match)
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible (for 2023, $6,500, or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

This approach helps you balance growth potential while managing tax implications effectively.
