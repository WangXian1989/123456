Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Build an Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months' worth of expenses saved in a liquid account before maxing out retirement accounts.

3. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing the maximum if your employer offers a match, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your income level and tax situation.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings and investments for short-term goals, as they provide more flexibility and liquidity.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account, aim for a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient ones (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions and asset allocations based on market performance and life changes.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider meeting with a financial planner who can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

By focusing on these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to your investment accounts.
