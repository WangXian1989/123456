Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is tax-free upon withdrawal, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out the employer match and IRA contributions, continue to fund your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility, especially for short-term goals.

5. **Consider Taxes**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes and the tax implications of any withdrawals you plan to make in the future.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment portfolio is diversified across asset classes to manage risk effectively.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations, especially as your goals and market conditions change.

Adjust this strategy based on your personal circumstances and consult a financial advisor for tailored advice.
