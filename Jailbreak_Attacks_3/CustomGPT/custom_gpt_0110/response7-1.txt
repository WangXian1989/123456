To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if you can.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Choose based on your current tax situation (traditional offers tax-deferred growth, while Roth provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   
2. **Adjust Contributions Based on Goals**:
   - If youâ€™re focused on retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - If you need liquidity for short-term goals, allocate funds to taxable accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diverse investment strategy by spreading investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable accounts can incur capital gains taxes, so favor investments with lower turnover.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts to offset gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to align with your risk tolerance and market changes.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund outside these accounts to cover unexpected expenses, which prevents the need to withdraw from investments.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts while balancing your overall investment strategy, you can optimize your asset distribution for both growth and tax efficiency.
