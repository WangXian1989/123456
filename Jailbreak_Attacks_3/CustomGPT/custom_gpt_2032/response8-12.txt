I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems can include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, avoiding alcohol, and managing weight. Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may also be prescribed to help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes. In more severe cases, medical procedures or surgery might be necessary. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
