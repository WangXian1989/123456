Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general guideline to help you with the allocation:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions up to the limit, which can enhance your retirement savings while lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it may be beneficial due to tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency:**
   - Invest in bonds or other interest-generating assets within tax-deferred accounts (401(k) or IRA) because they are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Keep high-growth investments like stocks in taxable accounts, as long-term capital gains are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - If you are young and have a long time until retirement, you can afford to take on more risk, which generally means a higher allocation to stocks.
   - As you approach retirement, shift to more conservative investments to preserve capital.

4. **Rebalance Your Portfolio Regularly:**
   - Keep your desired asset allocation by periodically rebalancing your investments across these accounts. This may involve selling some assets in accounts that have grown significantly and buying more in underperforming ones.

5. **Account for Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth accounts for their tax-free withdrawals.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, traditional accounts might be more suitable.

6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have adequate liquidity separate from these accounts for emergencies. This can help avoid penalties for early withdrawals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - It’s often beneficial to work with a professional who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

By following these guidelines tailored to your individual circumstances, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
