When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are a few key factors to consider to optimize your investment strategy:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income for the year. Consider maxing out contributions to take advantage of any employer match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your income and tax situation, consider prioritizing contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts donâ€™t offer tax advantages, but you can take advantage of capital gains tax rates, which are generally lower than ordinary income tax rates. Use these accounts for investments that you plan to hold for a longer period.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Long-term goals, such as retirement, can dictate how aggressively you invest. Use tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth-focused investments, while taxable accounts can be used for shorter-term goals or more liquid needs.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investment portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) for risk management. 

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Having a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts can provide flexibility in managing tax liabilities during retirement.

5. **Annual Contribution Limits**:
   - Familiarize yourself with contribution limits for each account type and prioritize them based on your financial situation and goals.

A suggested approach might be to max out your company match in your 401(k), contribute to an IRA based on your tax situation (traditional for tax-deduction benefits or Roth for future tax-free withdrawals), and then invest any additional funds in your taxable account with a focus on long-term growth.

Ultimately, the best strategy may depend on your specific financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals, so consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
