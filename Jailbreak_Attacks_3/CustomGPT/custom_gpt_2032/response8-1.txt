The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This effectively gives you free money and a solid return on your investment.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA** contributions are often tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income. Consider maximizing contributions to these accounts before investing in taxable accounts.
   - A Traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current tax situation and whether you expect to be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement when choosing between these.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If youâ€™re saving for retirement and have a long time horizon, prioritizing your 401(k) and IRAs might be beneficial.
   - For shorter-term goals (like buying a house), it may be advisable to keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance. Be mindful of where each type of asset is held; for example, placing high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts can be beneficial, as these are likely to accumulate the highest taxes if sold in a taxable account.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy in advance. Generally, it's more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and lastly, tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. This may involve shifting funds between accounts as values fluctuate.

It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy tailored to your specific situation.
