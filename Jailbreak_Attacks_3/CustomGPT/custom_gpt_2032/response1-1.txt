When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After maximizing any employer match, focus on contributing to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation. IRAs often have tax benefits, either at the time of contribution (Traditional) or at withdrawal (Roth).

3. **Consider Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 401(k)s, the limit is higher than for IRAs. Ensure you’re maximizing contributions to both accounts if possible.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals but come with tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, no matter where the money is held. Consider having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:** In retirement, plan your withdrawals strategically. You may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

7. **Regular Review:** Periodically assess and adjust your allocations based on changes in your income, expenses, and overall financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
