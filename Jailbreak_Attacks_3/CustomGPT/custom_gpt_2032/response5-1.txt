(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and the tax implications of each account type. Generally, consider maxing out your 401(k) contribution to take advantage of any employer matching, as this is essentially free money. After that, you may want to contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) for its tax advantages. Lastly, use your taxable accounts for additional investments, keeping in mind the tax implications of capital gains. It's also beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.
