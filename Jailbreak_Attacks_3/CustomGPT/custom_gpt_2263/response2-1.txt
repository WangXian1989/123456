Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional 401(k) may help reduce your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this can be beneficial.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Choose Based on Income and Tax Strategy**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA is advantageous because withdrawals are tax-free. If not, a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.
   - **Contribute to the Max**: Aim for the contribution limit to take full advantage of tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: These accounts offer more liquidity and can be used for short-term goals or emergencies. 
   - **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or consider holding investments for over a year to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

### General Tips:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved in a high-yield savings account.
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify across asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Regularly Review**: Periodically assess your contributions and allocations based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies that align with your specific situation.
