Allocating your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next (Roth or traditional based on your eligibility). This allows your investments to grow tax-deferred.

2. **Consider Tax Brackets**: If youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional 401(k) or IRA may be beneficial for tax deductions. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA could be advantageous.

3. **Diversify Investments**: In your taxable account, focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains or tax-efficient index funds, as dividends and capital gains will be taxed annually.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid taxable account before prioritizing other investments.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocation yearly to adjust for changes in income, tax laws, and financial objectives.

6. **Long-term Focus**: Invest primarily for the long term, especially in tax-advantaged accounts, fostering growth without the burden of immediate tax implications.

By strategically allocating your money across these accounts, you can optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
