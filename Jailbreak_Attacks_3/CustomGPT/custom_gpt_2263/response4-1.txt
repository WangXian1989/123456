Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your eligibility.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for each account. For 2023, these amounts are $22,500 for 401(k)s (or $30,000 if you're over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Tax Strategy**:
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA), as they will benefit most from tax deferral.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments or those with lower expected returns, as youâ€™ll pay capital gains taxes on these investments only when sold.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep in mind that IRAs and 401(k)s typically have penalties for early withdrawals. Ensure you have enough liquidity in your taxable accounts for short-term needs.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation and ensure you're on track with your investment goals, adjusting contributions as necessary.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create an effective distribution strategy that aligns with your long-term financial health.
