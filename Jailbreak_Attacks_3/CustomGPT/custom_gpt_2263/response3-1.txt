Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money. If feasible, aim to max out contributions if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Decide based on your current and expected future tax rates.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments you may need access to before retirement, such as a down payment for a home or other short-term goals. Keep in mind that you'll be taxed on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account. This should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Within these accounts, diversifying your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) is crucial. Balance risk according to your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals.

5. **Periodic Review**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations annually or as your circumstances change (e.g., changes in income, expenses, or market conditions).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice tailored to your situation can be incredibly beneficial.

This general framework can help you create a balanced investment strategy tailored to your needs.
