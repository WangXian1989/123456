Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline for accessing the funds. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the maximum allowable limit if you’re in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a traditional IRA for tax deductions.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax burdens (like long-term capital gains or qualified dividends).
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Both 401(k) and IRA accounts grow tax-deferred, which usually benefits long-term investments.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Always ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a savings account or low-risk investment.

### 5. **Balance Based on Risk Tolerance**:
   - Allocate your investments according to your risk tolerance across all accounts.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Reevaluate your allocations as your situation changes (income, expenses, goals).

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
