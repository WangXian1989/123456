Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can depend on several factors, including your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maximizing the match, consider maximizing contributions to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation).

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs) are beneficial for long-term growth since you won't pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them valuable if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals**:
   - If you need liquidity or plan to access funds before retirement, consider taxable accounts, which can provide more flexibility.

5. **Strategic Asset Placement**:
   - Place income-generating investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.
   - Hold more volatile investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts for potential capital gains treatment.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your distribution based on changing goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy based on your specific situation.
