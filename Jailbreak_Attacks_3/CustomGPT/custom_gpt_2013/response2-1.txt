The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some considerations that may help guide your decision:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match—it’s essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions to your 401(k) before turning to taxable accounts, as contributions are typically made pre-tax (reducing your taxable income).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income limits, aim to contribute to an IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) are ideal for investments that may appreciate significantly over time and incur high tax rates if placed in a taxable account. Consider holding bonds or high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for assets that produce lower capital gains or qualify for favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains). Index funds and ETFs can be more tax-efficient in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Match your investment allocations to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Younger investors typically have a higher risk tolerance and may invest more in equities, whereas those nearing retirement may prioritize stability and income.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.

### 4. **Long-Term Goals**
   - **Retirement Planning**: Prioritize retirement accounts to benefit from compound growth. Set clear retirement goals to determine how much to save.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: If you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement, it might make sense to invest more heavily in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired allocation and adapt to changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

### Conclusion
Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation. Balancing contributions among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your tax benefits and support your long-term financial goals.
