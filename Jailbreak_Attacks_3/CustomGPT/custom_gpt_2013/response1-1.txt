Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider for effective distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum allowed if you have a good employer match. This account offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, whereas traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility. These accounts can provide liquidity and allow for capital gains tax management.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Consider Risk Tolerance**: Your investment choices should align with your appetite for risk. Generally, younger investors can afford to be more aggressive.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to spread out risk.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Hold Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Index funds and ETFs tend to be more tax-efficient compared to actively managed funds.
   - **Rebalance When Appropriate**: Regularly review your portfolio and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax impacts and changing regulations, it can be beneficial to work with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific goals and circumstances.

Ultimately, the best approach is personalized based on your financial objectives, your age, risk tolerance, and the time you have until retirement.
