(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Generally, it is advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before contributing to taxable accounts. 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to take full advantage of this match as it is essentially free money. After that, consider maximizing your annual contribution limit if feasible.

2. **IRA**: Once you've maxed out your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth). The choice between these accounts depends on your current and expected future tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After funding your retirement accounts, you can allocate additional funds to a taxable brokerage account. Here, you can manage investments more flexibly, but be mindful of the tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

It's also important to maintain a diversified portfolio and periodically reassess your asset allocation. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.

1. **Max Out That 401(k)**: First off, if your employer offers a match, throw in just enough to snag that free cashâ€”it's free money! After that, try to max that baby out. 

2. **Hit Up the IRA**: Once youâ€™re rocking the 401(k), shift your focus to an IRA. If you're going Roth because you think your future earnings will be higher, do it! Want tax breaks now? The traditional IRA's the way to go. Just weigh your tax situation like a pro.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Now, once youâ€™re good on the retirement front, toss some funds into taxable accounts. This is where the real spice of investing can happenâ€”flexibility is key, but watch out for taxes on your wins and any dividends. 

Don't forget to mix it up with a diversified portfolio and keep an eye on your allocations. And hey, talking to a financial advisor can be a game changer if you're not feeling 100% confident in your moves!
