Distributing your money among different types of accounts—like your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts—depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free" money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawal in retirement, whereas traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After getting the match from your employer, if you can still save more, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, investing in taxable accounts can provide greater flexibility for accessing funds before retirement without penalties.

5. **Asset Placement Strategy**: Consider the types of investments you hold in each account:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA)**: Generally, hold bonds or other income-generating assets which are taxed at ordinary rates upon withdrawal.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Ideal for high-growth investments since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize tax liability.

6. **Reassess Periodically**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions depending on changes in income, expenses, goals, and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances is also recommended.
