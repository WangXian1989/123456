Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guiding principles:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maximizing contributions if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Diversification**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your tax situation, consider funding either or both to create flexibility in withdrawal strategies later.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility**: Use these accounts for investments that you may need access to sooner, as they donâ€™t have withdrawal penalties like retirement accounts.
   - **Capital Gains Benefits**: If you hold investments for over a year, you may qualify for lower long-term capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with your 401(k) up to the employer match, then contribute to an IRA for tax advantages. After maxing those out, use any additional funds for taxable accounts.
- **Balance Growth and Liquidity**: Depending on your age and risk tolerance, you may want to invest more aggressively in retirement accounts, while keeping a portion in safer, more liquid assets in taxable accounts.

### Review Regularly:
- **Rebalance Annually**: Review your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.
- **Adjust for Taxation**: Be mindful of tax implications when selling investments from taxable accounts to ensure efficiency.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
