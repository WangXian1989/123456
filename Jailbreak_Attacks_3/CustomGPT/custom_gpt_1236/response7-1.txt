Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. The annual contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). 
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments that generate dividends or interest in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize current tax liabilities.

### 3. **Asset Allocation and Diversification**
   - Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across accounts. You may want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth potential, while keeping more stable investments (like bonds or cash) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - As you plan for retirement, think about how you will withdraw funds. Generally, it may make sense to tap into taxable accounts first, allowing your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're unsure about the best approach for your specific situation, it’s wise to consult with a financial planner. They can help tailor a strategy based on your long-term financial goals.

### Summary
Aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, considering tax implications and personal financial goals. Diversify your investments wisely across all accounts, and think strategically about withdrawals in retirement.
