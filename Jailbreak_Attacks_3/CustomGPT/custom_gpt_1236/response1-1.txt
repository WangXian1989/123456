Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional IRA might be more beneficial to reduce your taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for expenses you may need to access sooner than retirement. Depending on your financial situation, you can invest in index funds or ETFs to optimize tax efficiency.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments. Consider stocks for growth in your retirement accounts and bonds in your taxable accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Once you start withdrawing funds, understand the tax implications of each account. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly Roth accounts.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
