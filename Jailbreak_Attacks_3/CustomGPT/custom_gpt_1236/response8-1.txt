Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here's a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you can, max out contributions to an IRA after your 401(k) match. Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement), depending on your current tax rate and future expectations.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you've maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts. These are more flexible but be mindful of capital gains tax.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - For short-term goals (within 5 years), lean towards taxable accounts or low-risk investments.
   - For long-term goals (10+ years), aggressively invest in 401(k) and IRA options to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance. Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations annually and adjust based on performance and changing goals or life circumstances.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice from a professional can provide tailored strategies that reflect your unique situation.

This approach can help you optimize your retirement savings while considering current and future tax implications.
