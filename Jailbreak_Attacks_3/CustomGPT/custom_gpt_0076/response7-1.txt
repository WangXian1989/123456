When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute the maximum allowed to your IRA (traditional or Roth) for tax benefits. If you qualify for tax deduction, prioritize traditional over Roth.

3. **Balance 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After maximizing the match and IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) if it has good investment options and low fees.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and after-tax growth. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced investment strategy across all accounts. Diversify within each account type according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### Summary:
1. Maximize employer match (401(k)).
2. Max out IRA contributions.
3. Continue to fund the 401(k).
4. Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility.
5. Maintain diversification across all accounts.

Review your strategy periodically to align with changing goals and market conditions.
