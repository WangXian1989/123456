To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, and you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions up to the match limit.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer tax benefits; however, capital gains, dividends, and interest are taxed. Consider holding investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., long-term capital gains).

2. **Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k) accounts (plus a catch-up contribution if you're over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs.

3. **Investment Goals**: Align your asset allocation strategy with your financial goals. For long-term growth, a more aggressive approach in tax-advantaged accounts may be beneficial, while holding more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your future withdrawal strategy to minimize taxes. Typically, you may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your investments are well-diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance across all accounts.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation and goals.

Based on these factors, consider a possible distribution strategy, such as maxing out your employer match in your 401(k), contributing to an IRA, and then using leftover funds for additional 401(k) contributions or taxable accounts as appropriate.

Evaluate your priorities and adjust your strategy as necessary.
