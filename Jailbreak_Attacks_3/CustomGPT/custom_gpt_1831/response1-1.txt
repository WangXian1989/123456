To optimize the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by ensuring you are contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching. This is essentially “free” money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Since both 401(k)s and IRAs offer tax benefits, prioritize maxing out these accounts before putting additional money into taxable accounts. For the IRA, choose between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA based on your current tax situation and future expectations.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Assign more aggressive investments (like stocks) to accounts where you'll pay lower taxes on gains (like an IRA or 401(k)) and less aggressive investments (like bonds) to taxable accounts where the tax burden may be higher.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: In your taxable accounts, consider investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) and minimize trading to keep tax liabilities low.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you are diversifying your investments across all accounts to reduce risk and target long-term growth.

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**: As you near retirement, plan how you will withdraw funds from these accounts in tax-efficient ways to minimize your overall tax burden in retirement.

Finally, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your financial situation, goals, and timeline.
