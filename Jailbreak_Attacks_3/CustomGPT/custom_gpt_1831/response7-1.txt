The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** If your employer offers a 401(k) with matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After hitting the employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your eligibility and tax preference). This provides tax benefits that can enhance your retirement savings.

3. **Diversify within Accounts:** Ensure that your investments within each account align with your overall investment strategy. This means a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets, adjusted for your age and risk tolerance.

4. **Tax Efficiency:** Be mindful of the tax implications:
   - **401(k):** Traditional contributions reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. 
   - **IRA:** A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

5. **Reassess Regularly:** Your financial situation and goals may change, so it's essential to review and adjust your contributions and allocation periodically.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your personal financial situation.
