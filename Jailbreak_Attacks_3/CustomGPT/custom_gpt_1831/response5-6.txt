4. **Get Interactive**: Ditch the boring old ads! Create challenges, quizzes, or games. Make voting feel like a movement, not a chore. Remember, younger generations love a good viral moment!
5. **Inform and Empower**: Don't leave them in the dark about how to vote. Make it super easy with checklist-style guides. Theyâ€™ll appreciate the clarity, and it might just motivate them to hit the polls.
