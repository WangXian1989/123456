3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases or for conditions like liver cancer, surgical options may be necessary.
5. **Complementary Therapies**: Utilizing supplements or alternative treatments under guidance can support liver function.

Always discuss treatment options with your doctor for a tailored approach.
