To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider whether a Traditional or Roth IRA fits your tax situation. Max out contributions if possible.

2. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts. Different accounts may have different investment options.

3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on capital gains.
   - Keep lower-growth or income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for long-term withdrawals. Itâ€™s often beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Regular Review:**
   - Periodically reassess your allocation to ensure it meets your changing financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personal circumstances can significantly impact the best strategy, so consider professional advice tailored to your situation.

If you have specific financial goals or tax brackets, those could further refine your strategy!
