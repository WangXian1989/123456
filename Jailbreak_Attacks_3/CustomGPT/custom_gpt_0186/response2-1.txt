Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax advantages, your financial goals, and liquidity needs. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maximizing your contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Contribute to an IRA to take advantage of tax-deferred growth (Traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth), depending on your income level and retirement strategy.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates. It’s also a good place for emergency funds or short-term goals.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth through equities, using a diversified mix based on your risk tolerance. Consider lower-cost index funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold bonds and less volatile investments here to minimize tax implications.

### 4. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize tax liability, potentially drawing from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts.

### Conclusion
The optimal distribution depends on individual circumstances, including current income, tax bracket, and retirement horizon. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a specific strategy based on your personal situation.
