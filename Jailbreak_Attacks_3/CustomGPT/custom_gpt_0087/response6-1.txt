Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic planning for growth, tax efficiency, and liquidity. Here’s a concise breakdown:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Contributions:** Maximize your employer match first, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices:** Focus on options with low fees and good historical performance.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Good for reducing taxable income. Consider it if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Ideal for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Fund it if you anticipate being in the same or a higher tax bracket.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity:** Use these for short-term goals or emergencies since they allow easy access to funds.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on investments that produce qualified dividends and long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

### **Strategy Summary**
- **Prioritize 401(k)** contributions up to your company match.
- **Max out IRA contributions** based on your tax situation (traditional vs. Roth).
- Allocate remaining funds to **taxable accounts** for flexibility and short-term needs.

### **General Tips**
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Assess your allocations annually or after significant market changes.
- **Diversify Investments:** Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

This approach can help optimize your retirement savings while balancing growth and tax implications.
