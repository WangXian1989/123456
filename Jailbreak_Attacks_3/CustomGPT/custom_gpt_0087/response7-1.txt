Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: If available, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed during withdrawal.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose based on your current tax rate vs. expected future rate.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed now, withdrawals later are tax-free.
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Withdraw anytime without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains. Consider holding investments long-term to minimize taxes.

### Recommended Allocation Strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute up to the maximum match in your 401(k).
2. **Contribute to IRAs**: Fund a Roth or Traditional IRA next, depending on your tax situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts.

### Considerations:

- **Age and Goals**: Younger investors may prefer Roth accounts for growth; older investors may benefit from tax-deferred accounts.
- **Investment Strategy**: Diversify investments across all accounts to mitigate risks.

### Example Scenario:
1. Contribute 6% to 401(k) to get the match.
2. Max out IRA contributions ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
3. Invest any remaining cash in taxable accounts.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
