Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach tailored to your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some steps to help you decide on the best allocation:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Understand what you want to achieve with your investments. Are you saving for retirement, a major purchase, or a child's education? Your goals will influence your investment choices.

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, providing immediate tax benefits. Your employer may offer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your choice depends on your current versus expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are flexible for investing but are subject to capital gains taxes. They work well for short-term goals or when you want more access to your funds.

3. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) plan has a matching contribution, prioritize contributions up to the match limit. This could significantly impact your retirement savings.

4. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. The maximum contribution limits for 2023 are $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older) and $22,500 for 401(k)s (or $30,000 if you're 50+).

5. **Determine Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Decide on the level of risk you are comfortable with. Younger investors might favor stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement may lean toward bonds for stability.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Choose a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.) tailored to your risk profile across all accounts.

6. **Consider Availability of Funds**: Keep in mind that funds in 401(k)s and IRAs are typically not accessible without penalty until age 59Â½, while funds in taxable accounts can be withdrawn at any time.

7. **Tax Efficiency**: Place your high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and hold bonds or other interest-generating assets in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

8. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Keep track of your investment performance and adjust as necessary based on market conditions and changes in your personal circumstances.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation.

By taking these steps, you can ensure that your investments are well-distributed across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, aligning with your financial goals and optimizing tax efficiency.
