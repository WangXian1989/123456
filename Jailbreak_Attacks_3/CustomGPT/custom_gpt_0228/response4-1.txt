To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions; contributions may reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account; traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible access to funds but subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If available, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Good for pre-tax contributions; consider it first if in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Use a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. If you're eligible, contribute to both traditional and Roth IRAs based on your tax situation.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts, but consider the tax implications of each. For example, keep tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Long-Term Strategy**:
   - Aim to max out contributions annually. For 2024, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if age 50+).

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in income, market conditions, and retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider speaking with a financial planner.

By strategically approaching your investments considering these factors, you can optimize your overall portfolio for retirement.
