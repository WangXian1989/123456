Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investing. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and consider tax-efficiency—hold tax-inefficient investments (like REITs) in tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio and adjust based on changing goals, market conditions, or tax laws.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
