Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits to a 401(k), but be mindful of income limits for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Good if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Less tax-efficient, but they provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and no contribution limits.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time until retirement. Younger individuals might prefer more aggressive investments in their 401(k) and IRA, while older investors may shift to bonds or more stable assets.

### 4. **Regular Contributions**
   - Ensure consistent contributions across accounts. Automating investments can help maintain this.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and investment performance. Adjust contributions based on changes in your financial situation or investment goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice, especially if your financial situation is complex.

Balancing contributions in this way allows you to optimize for growth while managing taxes effectively.
