To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Focus on putting higher contributions here, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket, since contributions lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now.
   - **Consider Maxing Out**: If you're under 50, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income (like bonds) or if you need liquidity.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider investments like index funds and ETFs, which have lower turnover and generate fewer capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Balance your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Equities are typically more suited for long-term accounts (401(k) and IRA), while conservative investments might be better suited for taxable accounts due to their tax implications.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement to optimize taxes, often withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and market conditions.
