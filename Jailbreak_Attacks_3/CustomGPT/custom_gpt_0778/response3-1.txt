Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, can be either traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but offer flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before allocating funds, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Prioritize Account Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to at least the employer match.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, focusing on Roth IRAs if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **Tax-advantaged Accounts**: Focus on growth investments (stocks) in tax-deferred accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding income-generating investments like bonds in retirement accounts to defer taxes.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed, considering changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain, a financial advisor can tailor a plan according to your specific circumstances.

Overall, the strategy should align with your long-term financial goals and tax considerations.
