To optimize your financial strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Tax-deferred growth; often includes employer match; higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Also tax-deferred; traditional IRAs give tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages; capital gains and income from investments are taxable.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Higher Income Bracket:** Focus on maximizing tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) to lower current taxable income.
   - **Lower Income Bracket or Early Career:** Contributing to a Roth IRA can be beneficial since you'll pay taxes now at a lower rate.

### 3. **Utilize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match before considering other accounts.

### 4. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution if age 50+).

### 5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Diversify your portfolio across all accounts based on risk tolerance, investment horizon, and goals. Consider a mix of:
     - **Stocks** for growth (especially in Roth IRAs for tax-free growth).
     - **Bonds** for stability and income, which can be strategically placed in taxable accounts to offset interest income.

### 6. **Maintain an Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have liquid assets in a savings account or similar before locking away significant amounts in retirement accounts.

### 7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**
   - Analyze your asset allocation periodically and adjust contributions to keep your risk level consistent with your goals.

### 8. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement, which accounts to draw from first to minimize taxes.
