Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions, may have employer match, limited investment options.
   - **IRA**: Can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax), offering more investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility in withdrawals, taxed on gains and income annually.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRAs**: After getting the match, consider contributing to an IRA, focusing on a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Tax Deferral vs. Tax-Free Growth**: Use pre-tax accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) for current tax advantages and Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or after-tax income needs. Investments should focus on tax-efficient funds to minimize taxes due.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investment choices based on your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced portfolio by diversifying across stocks, bonds, and other assets in all accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

### 6. **Plan for Withdrawals**: 
   - As you approach retirement, strategize which accounts to withdraw from first to minimize taxes and maximize longevity of your savings.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get a full employer match.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions (if you fall within income limits).
3. **Taxable Account**: Invest any additional savings here once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion:
Consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances, ensuring you optimize your overall investment and tax strategy.
