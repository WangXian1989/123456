When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider maxing out your contributions if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Determine if a Traditional or Roth IRA is best. Traditional IRAs offer upfront tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient savings in a liquid account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts, which provide more flexibility for withdrawals but may incur capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Distribute your investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. Stocks in retirement accounts and bonds in taxable accounts can be a balanced approach.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions as your financial situation and goals change.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can be beneficial, too!
