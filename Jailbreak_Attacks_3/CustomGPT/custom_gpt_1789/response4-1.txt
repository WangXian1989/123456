Distributing your money effectively across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **High Contribution Limits**: Take advantage of the higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: A Traditional IRA may be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. A Roth IRA can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher bracket, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Diversification**: You can choose investments that your 401(k) might not offer. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, useful for shorter-term goals.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize tax liability on capital gains.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
1. **First, Max Out the 401(k) Match**.
2. **Then, Contribute to an IRA**: Aim for the maximum annual contribution.
3. **Finally, Use Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, focus on taxable accounts for additional investments.

### Considerations:
- **Risk Tolerance**: Your asset allocation should reflect your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Tax Strategy**: Pay attention to the tax implications of each account type and adjust contributions accordingly.
