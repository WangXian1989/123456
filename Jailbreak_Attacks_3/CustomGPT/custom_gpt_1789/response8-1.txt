Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers a company match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out contributions if you’re in a high tax bracket. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a savings account before investing.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in these for goals with a shorter time horizon or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. They offer more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments in each account are diversified. Typically, consider more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative holdings in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation periodically to align with your risk tolerance and goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

These steps can help you build a solid investment strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals!
