Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Maximize Retirement Accounts First
- **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
- **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. Tax Considerations
- **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Focus on tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth. This allows your investments to compound without immediate tax liabilities.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for funds you might need in the short-term. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds.

### 3. Diversification Strategy
- **Asset Allocation**: Ensure you’re diversifying across asset classes within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Investment Types**: Consider holding high-growth, higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while putting more stable, dividend-producing investments in taxable accounts.

### 4. Review and Adjust Regularly
- **Annual Review**: Evaluate your investment performance and adjust allocations based on changing financial goals and market conditions.

By following these strategies, you can create a well-rounded distribution of assets that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
