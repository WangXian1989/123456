To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following modules to guide your decision-making process:

### Module 1: Understand Each Account Type

1. **401(k):**
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year.
   - **Employer Match:** Take full advantage of any employer matches.
   - **Withdrawal Restrictions:** Early withdrawals can incur penalties.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
   - **Types:** Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) vs. Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Contribution Limits:** There are annual contribution limits. 
   - **Tax Treatment:** Understand the implications for your current and future tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** No contribution limits, but you pay capital gains taxes on investments when sold.
   - **Best for short-term goals:** Useful for needs that arise before retirement age.

### Module 2: Determine Your Goals

- **Short-term Needs:** If you have near-term financial goals (like buying a home), prioritize taxable accounts for accessibility.
- **Mid to Long-term Goals:** Focus on maximizing retirement accounts which offer tax advantages.
  
### Module 3: Ideal Allocation Strategy

1. **Max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first:** Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, then max out your IRA contributions.
2. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any excess funds to your taxable account for flexibility.
3. **Consider Asset Location:** Place higher-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts (like the 401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on gains, while using taxable accounts for more conservative investments.

### Module 4: Review and Adjust

- **Annual Review:** Assess performance and adjust contributions based on changes in tax laws, your financial situation, or retirement goals.
- **Rebalance Investments:** Across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

### Key Takeaways

- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth potential.
- Assess your financial goals to dictate fund distribution.
- Review and adjust your strategy annually.
