To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA grows tax-free, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions.

2. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - Use your taxable account for more conservative investments, as youâ€™ll pay capital gains taxes on profits here.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - If you're young, focus on high-risk/high-reward investments in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - As you approach retirement, shift to more stable, income-generating investments.

4. **Diversify Your Portfolio:**
   - Maintain a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.
   - Ensure diversification within each account as well.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation based on market conditions and personal goals.
   - Adjust contributions and investments accordingly.

6. **Consider Withdrawals and Access Needs:**
   - Factor in which account's funds are accessible without penalties, especially if you may need to withdraw early.

7. **Stay Informed on Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type to ensure you're maximizing your savings.

A financial advisor can tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and retirement goals.
