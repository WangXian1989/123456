Young voters are often active on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter, so campaigns should utilize these channels to reach them.

Think TikTok challenges, slick Instagram stories, and engaging YouTube content that feels less like a campaign and more like a convo with friends. Don't just talk issuesâ€”show how theyâ€™re directly impacted by stuff like climate change, education costs, and social justice. Plus, authenticity is keyâ€”no one wants to feel like theyâ€™re being sold something. Use memes, relatable humor, and get influencers on board to keep it real and relevant!
