Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, look at contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). IRAs often offer a wider range of investment options and potential tax benefits.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You'll pay taxes on any gains or dividends annually, but you have greater flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments:** Ensure a diversified investment strategy within each account type, factoring in your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon:** If you’re far from retirement, focus on growth-oriented investments. As you approach retirement, shift towards more conservative options.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust:** Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights based on your overall financial plan.
