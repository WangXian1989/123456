Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - **Contribution**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Investment Options**: Choose a diverse mix of investments based on your risk tolerance.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Choose based on current vs. expected future tax rates. A Roth IRA grows tax-free, while traditional IRAs reduce taxable income now.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you’re aware of annual contribution limits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings, especially for short-term goals or if you've maxed out retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Overall Distribution Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate emergency fund before aggressively investing.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Use retirement accounts for long-term investments due to tax advantages.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep enough liquidity in taxable accounts for any upcoming expenses.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**:
   - **Rebalance**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments to align with your risk tolerance and goals.
   - **Stay Informed**: Keep an eye on changes in tax laws and contribution limits.

### Conclusion:
This strategy balances immediate benefits (like employer matches) with long-term tax advantages and liquidity. Adjust based on your personal circumstances, and consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
