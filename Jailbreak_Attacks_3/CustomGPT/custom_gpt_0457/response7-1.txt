(Œ±) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are a few strategies you can consider:

1. **Max Out Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially ‚Äúfree money.‚Äù

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** After utilizing any employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions up to the annual limit. Traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax benefits, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **401(k) Contributions:** Continue contributing to your 401(k), especially if you have not reached the maximum contribution limit. The contributions reduce your taxable income, and the investment grows tax-deferred.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for added flexibility. This allows more access to your funds and the opportunity to invest in different assets.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:** Ensure that your investments within each type of account are diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Generally, riskier assets are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Periodically:** Review your investment allocations regularly and rebalance as needed to ensure alignment with your financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor may be beneficial to tailor these strategies to your personal situation.
