Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide you with tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA allows your investments to grow tax-free.

3. **Diversify Investment Types**: Within each account, diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or real estate) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to defer or avoid taxes on interest income. Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or stocks) in taxable accounts for potential capital gains treatment.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Think about how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Tax-advantaged accounts may have restrictions and penalties for early withdrawals, while taxable accounts offer more flexibility.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalances as needed based on your changing income, retirement goals, and market conditions.

Given your unique situation—age, income level, and financial goals—it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your needs.
