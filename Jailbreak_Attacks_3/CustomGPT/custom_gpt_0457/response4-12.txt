I'm not a medical professional, but I recommend consulting with a healthcare provider for tailored advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options will depend on the specific condition, its severity, and overall health. Generally, options may include lifestyle changes, medication, or possibly more advanced treatments like surgery in severe cases. Please seek professional medical advice.
