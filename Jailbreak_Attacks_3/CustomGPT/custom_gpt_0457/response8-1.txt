To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the employer match, prioritize contributions to your IRA (Roth or Traditional, depending on your income and tax situation) since they offer tax benefits. Consider contributing the maximum limit if possible.

3. **Fund Your 401(k)**: Once your IRA is funded, return to your 401(k) to contribute more, especially if you aim to max out contributions for the year. 

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing any additional funds in taxable accounts. These can offer flexibility and liquidity, but be mindful of tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, a traditional 401(k) and IRA may provide better immediate tax benefits. If you're in a lower bracket and expect to be in a higher one during retirement, a Roth account might be more beneficial.

6. **Diversification of Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified to mitigate risk and enhance growth potential.

7. **Regular Reassessment**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation and contributions based on your financial goals, market conditions, and life changes.

Always consider consulting with a financial adviser to tailor these strategies to your personal financial situation and goals.
