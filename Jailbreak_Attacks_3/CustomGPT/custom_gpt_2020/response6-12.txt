### Lifestyle Changes
- **Diet Modification:** Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid high-fat and processed foods.
- **Regular Exercise:** Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity each week to help manage weight and liver health.

### Medical Treatments
- **Medications:** Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed. For example, antiviral medications for hepatitis or insulin for fatty liver disease.
- **Supplements:** Certain vitamins and herbal supplements may be beneficial, but consult a healthcare provider first.

### Monitoring and Management
- **Regular Check-ups:** Frequent liver function tests to monitor your liver health.
- **Avoid Alcohol:** If applicable, abstaining from alcohol is crucial for liver recovery and health.

### Advanced Treatments
- **Liver Transplant:** In severe cases of liver failure or cirrhosis, a transplant may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized evaluation and treatment plan based on your specific diagnosis.
