   - **Weight Management**: Losing excess weight can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: 
   - For conditions like hepatitis, antiviral medications may be prescribed.
   - Certain medications can help manage symptoms and complications.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Elimination of alcohol can prevent further liver damage.
