Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general breakdown:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money!).
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Tax Impact**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds or stocks for better after-tax returns. 

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Spread your investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts. This helps mitigate risk.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance as needed. 

### 5. **Understand Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan which accounts to withdraw from first during retirement to minimize taxes.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** 15%
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** 15%
- **Taxable Account:** 70%
