Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a balanced approach considering factors like tax implications, investment goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**: 
   - Stay aware of annual contribution limits for both 401(k)s and IRAs to ensure you're maximizing your benefits.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient vehicles like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes. Hold investments for longer to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Strategic Asset Allocation**:
   - Allocate more riskier assets like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Keep more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts as they can be taxed at ordinary income rates.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Getting personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation can provide valuable insights.
