Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible. Taxes are due on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are liable for capital gains tax when sold.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Maximize contributions to **401(k)** and **IRA** accounts first, especially if your employer offers a match (401(k)).
   - Use **Roth IRAs** for tax-free growth if you're in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional investments once you've maxed out retirement accounts.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Place higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or municipal bonds) to manage tax implications better.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Adjust your portfolio based on your age, risk tolerance, and market conditions, ensuring each account remains aligned with your goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personalized advice can help tailor your strategy based on your unique financial situation.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced investment strategy that maximizes growth potential while managing tax liabilities.
