Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. 401(k) Accounts
- **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match; it's essentially free money.
- **Consider Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older). Given the higher limits, maximizing contributions can be beneficial.

### 2. IRA Accounts
- **Aim for Roth Contributions:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA because of the tax-free growth and potential tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Traditional IRA Considerations:** If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be more beneficial, allowing you to lower your taxable income now.

### 3. Taxable Accounts
- **Use for Short-Term Goals:** If you need funds for goals within the next 5-10 years (e.g., buying a home), prioritize your taxable accounts for liquidity.
- **Investing in Tax-Efficient Funds:** Focus on index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the employer match, then maximize contributions if possible.
2. **IRA:** Next, contribute to your IRA, focusing on a Roth if you qualify.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use funds from any leftover income or savings after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions for taxable accounts.

### Considerations:
- **Tax Implications:** Factor in your current and expected future tax rates.
- **Investment Goals:** Align your distribution strategy with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
- **Diversification:** Ensure you have a diverse set of investments across all account types.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
