Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k):** 
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Individual IRA Contributions:** Aim to max out your IRA contributions ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Tax Considerations:**
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **After Retirement Savings:** Use these for shorter-term goals, as you won’t get the same tax advantages.
   - **Invest for Growth:** Consider investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs that usually have lower turnover.

### Suggested Allocation:
- **Prioritize 401(k)** contributions for the match.
- **Next, focus on maxing out your IRA.**
- **Use taxable accounts for additional savings** after considering the above.

### Considerations:
- **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust your investments based on how much risk you're comfortable taking.
- **Time Horizon:** The closer you are to retirement, the less risk you might want to take.
- **Tax Planning:** Consult a financial advisor or tax professional for strategies specific to your situation.

Balancing contributions can help grow your wealth while optimizing for taxes in both the short and long term.
