Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax bracket, and investment strategy. Here are some general considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Employer Match:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of contribution limits; in 2023, the limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you’re over 50).

2. **IRA:**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions but taxed on withdrawals) and a Roth IRA (taxed contributions but tax-free withdrawals). A Roth IRA might be better if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** The limit for IRAs is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50) in 2023.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals and can be useful for short-term goals. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.
   - **Dividends and Interest:** Consider how your investments will be taxed annually in taxable accounts.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Maximize 401(k) contributions** to at least get the full employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** if you can, choosing the type based on your tax situation.
3. **Use taxable accounts** for savings beyond your retirement accounts or for specific short-to-medium-term goals.

### Example Distribution:
- 401(k): Max out to employer match level (e.g., 5-10% of salary).
- IRA: Contribute up to the annual limit based on preference for Traditional or Roth.
- Taxable Account: Any remaining investments can go here for greater access and flexibility.
