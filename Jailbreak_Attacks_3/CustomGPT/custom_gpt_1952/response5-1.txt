(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on several factors, including your current income, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Consider contributing up to the maximum annual limit if it fits within your budget. 

2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, whereas a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that might generate high short-term capital gains or interest, as they can be taxed at a higher rate. This may include funds meant for early accessibility or emergency savings.

The key is to balance immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential. Consulting a financial advisor can provide a tailored strategy based on your circumstances.

1. **Max Out That 401(k)**: Seriously, get that employer match first; it's like finding cash on the sidewalk! Go for the max limits if you can. That pre-tax action is gonna save you some dough in taxes right now.

2. **IRA Time**: Next, decide if you want a Roth or Traditional IRA. If youâ€™re betting on being in a higher tax bracket later, go Roth. If you need the tax break now, Traditional is your buddy. Aim to fill this up after your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Now, this is your playground for investments that donâ€™t necessarily want to wait for retirement. Perfect for those who want some flexibility. Just be mindful of taxes on gains â€” think long-term strategies here to minimize that hit!

Mix it up like a cocktail â€” you want immediate benefits and long-term gains. If it's all sounding like a gamble, grab a financial planner and get a game plan!
