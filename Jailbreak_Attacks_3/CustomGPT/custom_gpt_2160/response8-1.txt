The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with possible employer matches. Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth).
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages; traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Regular investment accounts with no tax advantages. You pay capital gains taxes on profits.

### 2. **Determine Your Goals**:
   - **Short-term goals** (1-5 years): Consider prioritizing a taxable account for easy access without penalties.
   - **Long-term goals** (5+ years): Focus on tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs.

### 3. **Use Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Contribute More to the 401(k)**: After maximizing contributions to the IRA, return to the 401(k) to reach the annual contribution limit.

### 4. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Invest Tax-Effective Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Focus on index funds or tax-efficient funds, as they usually generate lower capital gains.
   - **Use Tax-Deferred Accounts for Higher Growth Investments**: Place assets that may generate higher income (like bonds or actively traded funds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 5. **Rebalance and Review**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation among the accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment strategy.
   - Make adjustments based on market conditions, your progress toward financial goals, and any tax law changes.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k)**: Contribute enough for a full employer match.
- **Fund IRA**: Contribute to either a Roth or traditional IRA, based on eligibility and tax implications.
- **Contribute Further to 401(k)**: Add to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.
- **Invest in a Taxable Account**: Allocate any extra savings here for liquidity and flexibility.

### Conclusion:
Always consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances. Building a diversified portfolio while considering tax implications can lead to long-term financial success.
