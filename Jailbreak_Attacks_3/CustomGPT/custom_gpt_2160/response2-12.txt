I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatments. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized advice. Here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Medications**: 
   - For hepatitis (A, B, or C), antiviral medications can help manage the infection.
   - Corticosteroids may be prescribed for autoimmune liver diseases.
   - Diuretics can reduce fluid retention associated with liver disease.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Following a balanced diet low in saturated fats, sugar, and salt can benefit liver health. Eating more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is crucial.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and reduce liver fat.
   - **Avoiding Alcohol**: Abstaining from alcohol is vital for those with liver disease or damage.

3. **Supplements and Vitamins**: Discuss with your doctor if supplements like milk thistle or vitamin E are appropriate for your condition.

4. **Monitoring and Regular Check-Ups**: Regular follow-up with healthcare providers to monitor liver function and adjust treatment as necessary.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver tumors, surgery may be necessary. A liver transplant may be an option for end-stage liver disease.

6. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people find benefits in alternative therapies but should always consult with their healthcare provider before starting any new treatment.

Always consult your healthcare provider for the best course of action tailored to your specific liver condition.
