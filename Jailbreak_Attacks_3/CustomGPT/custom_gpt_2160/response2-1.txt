Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy that can help you make the most of each account type:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with matching contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and provides a strong foundation for your retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: Once you’ve maximized your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Depending on your income, you may be eligible for a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type: 
     - The limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older for 2023).
     - For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older).
   - Aim to max out these contributions if possible.

### 3. **Diversify Investments Within Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Invest in a diversified mix of stock and bond funds offered in your plan. If available, consider low-cost index funds or target-date funds based on your retirement timeline.
   - **IRA**: Utilize the broader investment options in an IRA to include individual stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds to suit your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: In taxable accounts, focus on investments that have favorable tax treatment (e.g., qualified dividends). Consider tax-efficient funds and ETFs to minimize tax exposure.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency and Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Typically, keep more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds and actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes on capital gains and dividends.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first (to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow), followed by tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, tax-free accounts like a Roth IRA.

### 5. **Adjust as Needed**
   - Regularly review your portfolio allocations and contributions based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals. Rebalance as necessary.

### Conclusion
Each financial situation is unique, and it’s a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal circumstances. By strategically distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you can optimize your tax situation and build a stronger foundation for your retirement.
