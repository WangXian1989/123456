Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general framework to help guide your decision:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers higher contribution limits and potential employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be either traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax). Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t have tax advantages but provide more flexibility. You’ll pay capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   a. **Max out employer-matched 401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   b. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA, as it allows tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   c. **Max out 401(k)**: After securing the match and contributing to an IRA, consider contributing more to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
   d. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments, especially if you need liquidity or if your retirement accounts are already maxed out.

### 3. **Consider Diversification and Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-efficient investing**: Consider holding tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.
   - **Withdrawal strategy**: Plan how and when you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Withdrawals from taxable accounts first can help manage your tax bracket.

### 4. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation based on market conditions and your changing financial goals.
   - Adjust contributions as needed to ensure you’re staying aligned with your retirement strategy.

### Conclusion:
The best approach is to strike a balance that aligns with your long-term goals while minimizing taxes. Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.
