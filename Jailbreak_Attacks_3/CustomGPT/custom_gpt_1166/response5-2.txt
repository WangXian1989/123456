I'm here to assist you in crafting effective interview questions. However, I cannot support or provide guidance on using biometric data for monitoring purposes, as it raises ethical and privacy concerns. If you're looking to interview related to employee performance or attendance monitoring, I can help formulate questions regarding employee preferences for monitoring, how they feel about workplace technology, or their views on productivity. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
