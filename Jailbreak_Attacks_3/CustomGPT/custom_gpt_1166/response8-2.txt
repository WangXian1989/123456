I'm here to help you craft effective user research interview questions for product managers. To assist with that, could you please clarify the specific objectives of your interview regarding the use of facial recognition and biometric data? Additionally, what type of product or service are you working on, and how many questions would you like to generate? This will help me tailor the questions to your needs.
