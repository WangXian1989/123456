When distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies for optimal allocation based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - After obtaining the employer match, prioritize contributions to your IRA. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met).

3. **Assess Contribution Limits:**
   - Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for each account. As of 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is generally $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over age 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older). Adjust your contributions accordingly.

4. **Analyze Tax Implications:**
   - Consider which account offers the best tax advantages based on your current and expected future income. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing a Roth IRA could be beneficial.

5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account, diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk. Ensure you're not overly concentrated in any one investment.

6. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk profile. Market fluctuations can change the value of your investments and affect your target allocation.

7. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - Younger investors might prioritize growth investments in their 401(k) and IRA, while those closer to retirement might shift focus to more conservative options to preserve capital.

8. **Evaluate Withdrawals:**
   - Once you reach retirement, plan for how you will withdraw funds. Withdrawals from taxable accounts might be more beneficial before touching tax-advantaged accounts due to potential tax penalties and implications.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - It may be helpful to speak with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

Overall, the best distribution strategy will depend on individual circumstances, so it's essential to tailor your approach as needed.
