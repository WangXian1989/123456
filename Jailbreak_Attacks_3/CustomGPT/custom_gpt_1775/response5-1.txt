(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. A common strategy is to maximize your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts before allocating money to taxable accounts. Here are some general tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If youâ€™re eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs, you can start funneling money into taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Location**: Consider the types of investments in each account. For example, it may be beneficial to hold investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and higher growth investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

It's advisable to review your situation periodically and consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your needs.

1. **401(k) Hustle**: First things first, make sure youâ€™re shoving enough cash into your 401(k) to snag that employer matchâ€”donâ€™t leave free money on the table! Go ahead and max that bad boy out if you can.

2. **IRA Shenanigans**: Next up, consider a Roth IRA if youâ€™re eligible. Itâ€™s like investing in a tax-free growerâ€™s club, where your money gets to chill and grow tax-free till you cash out. A traditional IRA is cool too if you want some immediate tax relief instead.

3. **Taxable Playground**: After youâ€™ve hit the limits on your 401(k) and IRAs, itâ€™s time to dive into taxable accounts. Just remember, these babies are subject to taxes on your gains, so keep an eye on that.

4. **Asset Placement Mastery**: Play the asset location game. Put income-generating assets (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged spots and leave the growth stocks in your taxable account to let them ride tax-free for longer.

Bottom line: Max out those tax-advantaged accounts first, then figure out how much fun you want to have in your taxable accounts. But always keep an eye on your individual goals, and maybe hit up a financial advisor if you wanna dive deeper!
