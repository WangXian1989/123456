The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contributions:** Contribute up to the annual limit if you're not close to retirement, focusing on tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Considerations:** If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial. If you think your tax rate will be higher, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Diversify Contributions:** If eligible, contribute to both types of IRAs to provide tax diversification in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Use for Short-Term Goals:** If you have goals within the next 5 years, such as buying a home, consider using taxable accounts.
   - **Invest Wisely:** Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Overall Strategy:
- **Diversify:** Ensure a good mix of stocks and bonds across all accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your portfolio based on performance and changing risk tolerance.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals, consider speaking with a financial professional.

It's important to evaluate your individual circumstances and possibly consult a financial advisor to create a strategy that works best for you.
