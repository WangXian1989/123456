Î± The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, as these accounts grow tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of Roth IRAs). Depending on your income and tax situation, a Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed at any time without penalties, making them suitable for short-term savings goals or emergencies. Invest in tax-efficient assets here, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
4. **Diversification Strategy:** Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to reduce risk. Focus on asset allocation that aligns with your retirement timeline and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also a wise move to tailor this strategy to your specific needs.
