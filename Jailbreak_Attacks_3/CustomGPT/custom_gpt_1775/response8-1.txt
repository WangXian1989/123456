Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. It's essentially “free money.”

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions based on income.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which may benefit you if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, providing tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments you sell. Consider holding appreciating assets in tax-advantaged accounts longer for better growth.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure an appropriate mix of asset types in each account—stocks, bonds, and cash—to minimize risk and improve potential returns.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: If you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement, consider keeping a portion in taxable accounts, as they don't have early withdrawal penalties.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As you contribute and markets fluctuate, periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy based on your unique circumstances. 

By focusing on these strategies, you'll be better positioned to make the most of your retirement and investment accounts.
