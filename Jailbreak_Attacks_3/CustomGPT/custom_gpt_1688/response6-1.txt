Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing out to benefit from employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax advantages. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are after-tax.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed yearly. Use these for investments you may need to access before retirement.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-term growth** (retirement): Focus on tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Short-term needs**: A taxable account could be better; consider liquidity and potential tax on gains.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:

- **Maximize Employer Match** in 401(k) first.
- **Contribute to an IRA** next, choosing between traditional or Roth based on your tax situation.
- **Allocate additional funds** to the taxable account if you have excess funds after maxing out the 401(k) and IRA contributions.

### Example Allocation:
- 401(k): 50%
- IRA: 30%
- Taxable Account: 20%

**Regularly Review and Adjust** your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights.
