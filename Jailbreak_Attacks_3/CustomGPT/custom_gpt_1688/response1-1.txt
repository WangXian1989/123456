Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs can provide upfront tax deductions.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA, contribute further to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings, especially if you might need access to funds before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments to minimize tax burdens.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance. Tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) might be better in tax-advantaged accounts, while stocks can be suitable for taxable accounts due to their favorable capital gains treatment.

6. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your contributions and investment strategies based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice is also a good idea!
