Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start with your 401(k). Contribute enough to get any employer matching funds, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax; suitable for reducing taxable income now.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also offers tax-deductible contributions (depending on income limits).
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments with lower capital gains taxes (like index funds or ETFs) or for assets you may need access to before retirement.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments to minimize taxation on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Within each account type, maintain a well-diversified portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust allocations as needed to maintain your desired allocation strategy across all accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help optimize your strategy based on your specific circumstances.

This holistic approach ensures you leverage the unique benefits of each account type while aligning with your financial goals.
