It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can significantly help your liver.

2. **Medication**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat an underlying cause.

3. **Management of Underlying Conditions**: Treating conditions like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis can sometimes improve liver function.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with your doctor to monitor liver function tests and any changes in your condition.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options, including liver transplant, may be considered.

Always follow your doctorâ€™s guidance tailored to your specific situation.
