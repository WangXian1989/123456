Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is free money).
   - **Consider Tax Benefits**: Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, while Roth 401(k) contributions are after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**:
   - **Second Priority**: If youâ€™ve maximized your 401(k) contributions, focus on a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Consider Income Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits and income eligibility for Roth IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - **Flexible Access**: Use taxable accounts for medium-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Invest in assets with favorable tax treatment (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Maintain some liquidity here for emergencies.

### Key Tips:
- **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts.
- **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio according to your risk tolerance and market conditions.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your unique situation with professional advice.

By following these steps, you can optimize your investment strategy for both growth and tax efficiency!
