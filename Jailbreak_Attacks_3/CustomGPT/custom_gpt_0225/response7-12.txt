I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Alcohol Limitation**: Reduce or eliminate alcohol intake, as it can exacerbate liver issues.
   - **Weight Management**: Maintain a healthy weight through diet and exercise.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may include:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids**: For autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, treatments such as a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a hepatologist or a gastroenterologist for diagnosis and tailored treatment options.
