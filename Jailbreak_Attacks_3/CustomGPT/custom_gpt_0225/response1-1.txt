Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially “free” money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The tax benefits can be significant.

3. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency fund and consider paying off high-interest debt.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investing. This allows for withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Adjust Based on Goals**: If you’re saving for short-term goals, lean towards taxable accounts. For long-term goals, maximize tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
