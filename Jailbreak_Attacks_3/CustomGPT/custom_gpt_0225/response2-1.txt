Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA next, especially if it has tax advantages (like Roth contributions).

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments (like index funds).

4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions lower taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Pay capital gains taxes on profits; consider holding investments long-term to minimize this.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across accounts. For example, hold more bonds in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable accounts for better tax efficiency.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Monitor and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation and market performance.
