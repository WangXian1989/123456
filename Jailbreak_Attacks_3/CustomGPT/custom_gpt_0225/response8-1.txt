To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Think long-term for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals and investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they have favorable tax rates.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and investment goals:
   - Higher-risk, growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - More stable or income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates.

4. **Age and Retirement Horizon**: Younger individuals might lean towards aggressive growth in tax-advantaged accounts; those closer to retirement might prioritize stability and income.

5. **Regular Reviews and Adjustments**: Reassess your portfolio distribution regularly to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
