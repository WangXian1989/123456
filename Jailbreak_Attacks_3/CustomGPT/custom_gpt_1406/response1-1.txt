Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider for each account type:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the maximum contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). Contributing up to the limit can provide significant tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).
   - **Diversification into Different Asset Types**: Consider holding different asset allocations in your IRA compared to your 401(k) for diversification.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for accessing funds without penalties, making them suitable for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax. Consider utilizing tax-loss harvesting strategies, if applicable.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate liquid savings before heavily investing in taxable accounts.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize Debt Repayment**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that off before heavily investing.
- **Evaluate Risk Tolerance**: Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
- **Tax Implications**: Be aware of the tax implications of withdrawals and the investment growth in each account type.
- **Regular Review**: Regularly review and rebalance your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Approach:
- **401(k)**: 50% of your retirement savings.
- **IRA**: 30% of your retirement savings.
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20% of your total investments, especially if you need liquidity.
