Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key considerations regarding tax implications, growth potential, and your retirement goals. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to help you optimize your investment strategy:

### 1. Assess Your Contribution Limits
- **401(k)**: Check the annual contribution limit (for 2023, it's $22,500; $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
- **IRA**: The annual contribution limit for a traditional or Roth IRA is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older).

### 2. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **Max out employer matching**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.
- **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA, especially if you qualify for a tax deduction with a traditional IRA or can benefit from tax-free growth with a Roth IRA.

### 3. Balance Allocations
- **Consider your tax bracket**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, you may benefit more from traditional accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) rather than Roth accounts.
- **Diversify your taxable account**: If you're investing in a taxable account, consider holding investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. Regularly Review and Adjust
- **Reassess allocations**: Review your investments periodically to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and retirement goals. Adjust as necessary based on market performance and life changes.
- **Tax-loss harvesting**: Use your taxable accounts strategically to offset gains with losses, improving your overall tax efficiency.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **50% in 401(k)** (up to the employer match, then max contributions)
- **30% in IRA** (prioritize traditional or Roth based on your tax situation)
- **20% in taxable accounts** (diversified and tax-efficient investments)

This balanced approach can help you optimize tax benefits while working towards long-term financial growth. Regular check-ins on your strategy will ensure you stay aligned with your goals.
