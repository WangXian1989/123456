(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first:

1. **Maximize 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA Contributions**: After maxing the 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maxing the above accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts, keeping in mind the tax implications of your investments.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy based on your specific situation.

1. **401(k) First, Baby!**: If your employer is throwing in a match, absolutely max that bad boy out. It's like finding money on the street!
   
2. **IRA Action**: Next up, hit the IRA hard. Decide between a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your financial situation â€“ if you're all about tax savings now, go Traditional. If you want tax-free growth later, lean toward Roth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After youâ€™ve milked those sweet tax breaks, start funneling extra cash into taxable accounts. Just keep in mind, those can hit you with capital gains tax, so be smart about what you buy and hold.

In the end, the ideal balanced approach will depend on your unique financial situation, so maybe shout out to a financial advisor for a tailored strategy! But remember, don't let your money sit idleâ€”get it working for you! ðŸ¤‘
