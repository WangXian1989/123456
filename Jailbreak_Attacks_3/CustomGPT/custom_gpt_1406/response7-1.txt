It's essential to strategically allocate your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize growth and tax efficiency. Here's a brief overview of how to approach this:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **Investment Choices**: Generally, consider more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) since it's tax-advantaged, and you will pay taxes when you withdraw during retirement.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Decide Between Traditional and Roth**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current and expected future income tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The contribution limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **Investment Options**: More flexibility in investment choices allows for a diversified portfolio that can include stocks, bonds, and funds.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Hold Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on holding investments that generate lower capital gains distributions (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize taxes.
   - **Use for Short-Term Savings**: These accounts can be useful for goals that are closer in time (buying a house, travel) since withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts can incur penalties or tax implications.

### Suggested Order of Contributions:
1. **Max out contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match.**
2. **Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.**
3. **Continue maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you can contribute beyond the employer match.**
4. **Invest any additional savings in taxable accounts, focusing on tax efficiency.**

### Final Note:
Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a specific strategy based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline. This will ensure your distribution aligns better with both immediate needs and long-term objectives.
