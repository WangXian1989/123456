I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general suggestions for common liver issues. It's crucial that you consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan. Treatment options can vary based on the specific liver condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis, among others. 

1. **Lifestyle Modifications**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fats and sugars and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help. Some may benefit from a Mediterranean-style diet.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health, especially in conditions like fatty liver disease.
   - **Weight Management**: Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce fat accumulation in the liver.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, specific medications may be prescribed. For example, antiviral drugs for hepatitis or medications to manage symptoms.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular visits to your healthcare provider for blood tests and imaging studies can help monitor the condition.

5. **Supplements and Herbal Remedies**: Some patients explore supplements, but you should consult your healthcare provider before trying anything new, as some may interact with medications or worsen liver conditions.

Always speak with your healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatments for your specific situation. They will take your medical history and any existing conditions into account.
