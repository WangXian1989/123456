The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are a few strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money" and should be prioritized.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide you with tax deductions in the year you contribute.

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA up to their annual limits if possible. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older) and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs that generate less taxable income.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Think about the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type. Withdrawals from traditional accounts will be taxed as ordinary income, while Roth withdrawals and capital gains from taxable accounts may be taxed at lower rates.

6. **Diversification of Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified to manage risk. Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon, which helps in long-term growth.

7. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed, especially as you approach retirement age. Adjustments may be necessary based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and objectives.
