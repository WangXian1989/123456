Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon for retirement. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to IRAs and 401(k)s since these accounts offer tax benefits. The traditional IRA and 401(k) allow for pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth contributions (paying taxes now) rather than traditional accounts. Conversely, if you are in a higher tax bracket now, traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you have a diversified investment portfolio. Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs can help manage risk.

5. **Allocate Funds Based on Time Horizon**: If you're closer to retirement, consider shifting more towards conservative investments. If you have a longer time horizon, you can afford to take more risks.

6. **Adjust as Needed**: Review your allocations annually and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Depending on your financial situation, seeking professional advice can help you create a personalized strategy.

In summary, the optimal way to distribute your money will vary by individual circumstances, but focusing on employer matches, tax advantages, and diversification will generally yield positive results.
