The best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and should be your first priority.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max out your IRA**: Consider contributing the maximum to your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your situation) since these accounts offer tax advantages.
   - **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once youâ€™ve maximized your IRA contributions, increase your contributions to your 401(k), especially if you haven't reached the contribution limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After you've contributed to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for accessing funds but are less tax-efficient.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, it's often recommended to hold more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while keeping more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts where capital gains can be taxed.

5. **Rebalance as Necessary**: Periodically review your allocations and consider adjusting them based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given that individual situations vary widely, it's a great idea to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor a plan to your specific needs.

This distribution strategy can help you optimize your savings and minimize tax liabilities over the long term.
