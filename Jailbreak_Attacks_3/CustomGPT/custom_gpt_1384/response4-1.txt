The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Plans**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now. Consider maximizing contributions up to the annual limit if you're aiming for aggressive growth.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Tax Diversification**: Consider a mix of Traditional and Roth IRAs. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions when you contribute, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep track of the annual contribution limits and make sure to contribute to your IRA if you're eligible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: These accounts provide easy access to your funds, which can be beneficial for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes if you sell investments at a profit. Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Based on your risk tolerance, determine how to allocate investments across these accounts. Typically, you might want to hold more aggressive growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and more stable investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax implications and investment strategies, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a distribution strategy to your specific financial situation.

Remember to review and adjust your distribution as your financial situation, goals, and the tax laws change.
