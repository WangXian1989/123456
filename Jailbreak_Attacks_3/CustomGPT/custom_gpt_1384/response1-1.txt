Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), but often with more investment options. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are subject to capital gains taxes on earnings. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties compared to retirement accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance across these accounts. For aggressive growth, you might hold more stocks in your retirement accounts while keeping more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Age and Timeline**: If you're younger and have a longer time horizon, a more aggressive allocation might make sense. As you near retirement, consider shifting to more conservative investments to preserve capital.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It can be beneficial to work with a financial planner to develop a strategy tailored to your specific situation.

Overall, optimizing your contributions across these accounts involves balancing tax efficiency with your investment goals.
