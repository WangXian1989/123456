To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **401(k) Accounts:** Max out your contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings. Focus on pre-tax contributions for tax advantages.

2. **IRA Accounts:** If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income now. Depending on your income level, choose the one that benefits you most in terms of tax efficiency.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may not fit into your retirement accounts, such as individual stocks or bonds. They provide flexibility in accessing funds without penalties, unlike retirement accounts. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments at a profit.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across all accounts. Keep tax-efficient investments like index funds in taxable accounts and higher-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax implications.

5. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts. This protects your long-term investments by providing liquidity for unexpected expenses.

6. **Annual Review:** Assess your investment strategy annually. Life changes or market conditions may require adjustments to your distributions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
