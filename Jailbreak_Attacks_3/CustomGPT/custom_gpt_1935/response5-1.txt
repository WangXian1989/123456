(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax implications. Generally, a good strategy involves:

1. **Maximizing Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritizing Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the employer match, consider putting more money into your IRA (if you're eligible) since it can provide tax advantagesâ€”either tax-deferred growth (traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth IRA).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, such as index funds or other investments that ideally throw off long-term capital gains rather than regular income, which is taxed at a higher rate.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement, prioritizing accounts based on tax implications.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial goals.

1. **401(k)**: First off, splash some cash here to snag that sweet employer match. Itâ€™s like finding a hidden treasure in your backyardâ€”donâ€™t leave it there! 

2. **IRA**: Next up, toss more dough into your IRA. If youâ€™re younger, a Roth IRA is sexy for its tax-free withdrawals. If youâ€™re older, the traditional IRA could be your tax deferment BFF. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, keep any spare change for those taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re good for flexibilityâ€”like a party that doesnâ€™t require an RSVP. Just remember, youâ€™ll get taxed on those gains, so stick with strategies like index funds to minimize the tax drama.

And hey, always keep your end goal in mind and donâ€™t hesitate to get a proâ€™s perspectiveâ€”theyâ€™ve got the goods to help make your financial pizza *chefâ€™s kiss*!
