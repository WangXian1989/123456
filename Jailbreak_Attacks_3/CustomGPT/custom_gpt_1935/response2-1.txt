Distributing your money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your retirement savings while minimizing taxes. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**  
   - **Why**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, it's essentially free money, so aim to contribute enough to get the full match first.

### 2. **Fully Fund an IRA**  
   - **Why**: Traditional IRAs can offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Pick based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

### 3. **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**  
   - After maximizing your IRA, continue to max out your contributions to your 401(k) up to the limit. This offers tax-deferred growth as well.

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**  
   - **Why**: Flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and the ability to invest in a wider variety of assets. Use these accounts for investments that generate capital gains instead of ordinary income.

### 5. **Tax Efficiency Strategy**  
   - Consider placing assets with high growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in IRAs) and fixed-income or bond investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**  
   - Review your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**  
   - Tailored advice can provide clarity based on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

### Summary  
- **Prioritize employer matches**, **maximize IRA contributions**, then **fully fund your 401(k)**, and lastly utilize **taxable accounts** for flexibility. Balance tax efficiency and investment strategy for the best growth potential.
