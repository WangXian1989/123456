Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money!

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k), but with different contribution limits and eligibility criteria.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with post-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including gains) are tax-free in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but you’re free to withdraw funds without penalties. Consider the tax implications of capital gains when investing.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in your taxable accounts for emergencies before aggressively funding your retirement accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Taxable accounts can be used for investments that may have more significant tax implications, like real estate or actively managed funds.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice, particularly regarding your tax situation and retirement goals.

Remember, the "best" distribution can vary widely based on each individual's circumstances, so it's crucial to tailor your strategy to fit your financial situation.
