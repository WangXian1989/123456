Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. Understand Contribution Limits:
   - **401(k)**: Higher contribution limits than IRAs; consider maximizing employer match.
   - **IRA**: Lower limits; traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions.

### 2. Tax Considerations:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA**: Convert to Roth if expecting a higher tax bracket in retirement, allowing tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for investments needing flexibility and can incur capital gains taxes.

### 3. Investment Goals:
   - **Long-term Growth**: Consider higher risk investments in IRAs/401(k)s where you wonâ€™t access funds for years.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 4. Diversification:
   - Spread investments across asset classes in all accounts to mitigate risk.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out 401(k)** contributions up to the match.
- **Contribute to IRA** for additional tax-advantaged growth.
- Invest in **taxable accounts** for short-term needs or additional growth potential.

Balancing these factors will help you create a strategy tailored to your financial situation. Consider consulting a financial advisor to develop a detailed plan that aligns with your specific needs.
