The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline for needing the funds. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k), it may provide matching contributions, which is essentially free money. Prioritize contributing enough to get the full match before directing money elsewhere. Additionally, contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Accounts**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you are eligible. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice between traditional and Roth should depend on your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investment. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices, but you need to be mindful of capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

4. **Diverse Investments**: Within each type of account, ensure that your investments are well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Goals and Timeframe**: Tailor your allocations based on your financial goals. For short-term goals (within 5 years), a conservative investment strategy may be wise. For long-term goals, you may opt for more aggressive investments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Finally, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your financial situation and help you develop a strategy that aligns with your goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
