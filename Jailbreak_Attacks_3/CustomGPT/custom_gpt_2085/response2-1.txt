When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy for optimal tax efficiency and savings growth:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Roth IRA Contributions:** If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Contribute to Traditional IRA:** If you're not eligible for a Roth IRA or have maxed out contributions, consider contributing to a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, depending on your income.

4. **Utilize 401(k) for Higher Contributions:** After meeting the above goals, maximize your contributions to your 401(k). This allows for higher annual contributions compared to IRAs.

5. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Wisely:** Use taxable accounts for investments in assets that generate capital gains or dividends that are taxed at lower rates, such as index funds or ETFs. Consider holding for the long term to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** It's beneficial to seek personalized advice that considers your specific financial situation, goals, and tax implications.

By following this strategy, you can create a well-rounded investment portfolio that balances tax efficiency and growth potential.
