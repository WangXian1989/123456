To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maximizing contributions here, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - Traditional IRAs let you defer taxes until withdrawal; consider this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for short-term goals, as they offer more flexibility. Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts and consider more stable investments in taxable accounts, where taxes on capital gains may apply.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before fully funding retirement accounts. This will help avoid penalties for early withdrawals.

5. **Ongoing Contributions**: Consistently contribute to all accounts; consider setting up automatic contributions to make it easier.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Assess your current and future tax situation, including how tax rates might change, to determine the best distribution for your circumstances.
