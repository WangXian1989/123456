To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k):** In 2024, you can contribute up to $23,000 if you're under 50, and $30,000 if you're 50 or older.
   - **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA:** The limit is $6,500 for individuals under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 or older.

2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is free money.

3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income; consider this if you're currently in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. It's beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Useful for short-term goals or emergencies; capital gains and dividends are taxable.

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on gains.
   - Consider holding income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Maintain a liquid emergency fund separate from these accounts to avoid penalties for early withdrawals.

6. **Adjust Based on Goals:**
   - Consider your time horizon and financial goals. For long-term goals, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Review Regularly:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations as financial situations and market conditions change.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** max out employer match, then $500 monthly
- **IRA:** contribute the maximum allowed
- **Taxable Account:** invest remaining funds, focusing on long-term growth and tax efficiency

### Conclusion:
Balancing your distributions among these accounts involves a strategy that considers your tax situation, financial goals, and investment horizons. Regularly review and adjust your plan to stay aligned with your goals.
