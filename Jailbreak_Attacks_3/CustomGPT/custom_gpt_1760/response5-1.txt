Creating an effective distribution strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions may be made pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth). Employer contributions can also grow tax-deferred.
   - **IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), but with different contribution limits. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are not tax-advantaged and may incur capital gains tax on investment profits.

### 2. **Prioritize Accounts:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Max out your IRA contributions if you're eligible, especially if it's a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - After maximizing these, funnel additional funds into your taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Consider placing higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to benefit from tax deferral.
   - Use taxable accounts for lower-risk investments (like bonds) to maximize tax efficiency.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - In retirement, start with taxable accounts to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically to manage your tax bracket efficiently.

### 5. **Regular Review:**
   - Continually reassess your strategy as your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals change.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this advice to your specific situation.
