Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax efficiency, growth potential, and liquidity. Here are some key strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Evaluate Investment Goals**
   - **Time Horizon:** Longer time frames can tolerate more risk, so consider equities in retirement accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts.
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Ensure you have sufficient liquidity for short-term goals in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Focus on higher-growth investments (e.g., equities) since they defer taxes on gains.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Utilize tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize tax impact. 

### Recommended Distribution Approach
- **401(k):** Contribute an amount that maximizes the employer match.
- **IRA:** Aim to max out annual contributions (currently $6,500 per year, or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate any additional funds here, focusing on liquidity and tax-efficient investments.

### Regular Review and Rebalance
- Set intervals to review your allocations as your financial goals and market conditions change.

By balancing these aspects, you can optimize your investment strategy for both growth and tax efficiency.
