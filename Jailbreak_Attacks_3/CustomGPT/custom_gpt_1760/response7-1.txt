To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Familiarize yourself with the contribution limits for each account type. In 2024, the contribution limits are $23,000 for 401(k) accounts and $7,500 for IRAs (for individuals under 50). 

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally offers pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income now, but youâ€™ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deductible, whereas Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest here for money you might need before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Consider asset allocation tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon. For long-term growth, equities may be appropriate for your retirement accounts, while bonds might be suitable for more immediate needs in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, age, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure how to balance these accounts based on your unique situation, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.

By considering these factors, you can create a well-structured plan for distributing your money effectively.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, then prioritize it further if you have additional funds.
- **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you're eligible; otherwise, use a traditional IRA based on your deduction limits.
- **Taxable Account**: Use this for additional savings and short-term investments; focus on low-turnover, tax-efficient funds.

Adjust your contributions based on your financial goals and priorities to optimize growth and tax efficiency.
