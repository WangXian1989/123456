Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize tax-deferred accounts (e.g., 401(k) and traditional IRA) for higher-income years to reduce taxable income.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as they might be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts, focusing on a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets depending on your risk tolerance.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments to align with your long-term goals and market changes.

5. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - Understand the rules for withdrawing from each account type, especially if you plan to retire early or need funds before age 59½.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have liquid assets in a savings account or insured money market fund for emergencies before tying up too much in retirement accounts.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
