I canâ€™t provide medical advice, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. They can recommend the best treatment based on your specific condition. Common approaches may include medication, lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), or procedures based on the underlying cause of the liver issue. Always prioritize expert guidance for health concerns.
