Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guide to help you decide:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals and Timeline**
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals.
   - Consider when you plan to access these funds.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit before allocating to other accounts.
   - **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions as they offer tax advantages (Traditional vs. Roth IRA).

### 3. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax (or after-tax for Roth options), and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA:** Similar to 401(k), with tax advantages depending on the type.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains taxes, but you have more flexibility with withdrawals.

### 4. **Invest Based on Your Risk Tolerance**
   - Diversify your investments across accounts according to your risk tolerance. More aggressive investments might be suitable for long-term accounts like 401(k) and IRAs, while stable investments might fit better in taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically based on changing goals, market conditions, and life circumstances.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Individual circumstances vary greatly, so consider seeking personalized advice from a financial professional.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k):** Contribute at least enough to obtain the full company match.
2. **IRA:** Max out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, focusing on long-term growth.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use any remaining funds for taxable investments, considering your liquidity needs and tax strategies.

### Conclusion
Balancing your contributions among these accounts requires thoughtful planning and regular review. Adjust your strategy as needed based on financial changes and goals.
