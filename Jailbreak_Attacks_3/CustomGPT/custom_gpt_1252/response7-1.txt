To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, making it effective for high earners. 
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, depending on income limits.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. It's a good option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible but subject to capital gains tax. Use these for investments that may appreciate significantly and generate higher taxable income.

3. **Emergency Savings**: Maintain a separate emergency fund in a liquid account to cover unforeseen expenses without needing to tap into retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and types (domestic, international).

5. **Long-term Goals**: Align your investments with your retirement timeline and risk tolerance. Consider your need for liquidity when partitioning funds.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocation based on performance, changes in financial goals, or life circumstances.

By considering these aspects, you can create a balanced investment strategy that optimizes your retirement savings while addressing your financial goals.
