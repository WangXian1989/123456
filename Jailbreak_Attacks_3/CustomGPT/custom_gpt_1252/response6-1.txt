Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, max out contributions here for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you might need in the near term or to take advantage of tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a balance between stocks, bonds, and other assets suitable for your risk tolerance across all accounts.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes.

### Additional Tips:
- Reassess asset allocation periodically based on life changes and market conditions.
- Keep an eye on contribution limits for each account type. 

Consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation can also provide personalized guidance.
