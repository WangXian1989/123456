To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your contributions, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

2. **Investment Choices**:
   - **401(k)**: Usually has limited investment options; focus on low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Offers more flexibility in choosing investments. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed upfront, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; long-term holdings are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.
   - Be strategic about using tax-deferred accounts to lower your taxable income in retirement.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailored advice can help you create a distribution strategy based on your personal financial situation and goals.

This approach aims to balance growth potential with tax efficiency and risk management.
