Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

2. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient vehicles like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding bonds and high-turnover funds in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Higher earners may benefit more from tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA), while lower earners may consider Roth IRAs for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Age and Time Horizon**:
   - Younger investors might lean more heavily on growth-focused investments in taxable accounts. Closer to retirement, shift towards income-generating investments.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a balanced asset allocation that fits your risk tolerance across all accounts. Ensure you aren't overexposed in any one account type.

6. **Regular Reassessment**:
   - Regularly review your strategy and adjust based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
