Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key considerations. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer match; tax-deferred growth; limited investment options.
   - **IRA**: Flexible investment choices; tax advantages (Roth offers tax-free withdrawals; traditional may offer tax deductions).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages; can use for short-term goals or to access funds without penalties.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match (if available) first.
   - **Fund Roth IRA or Traditional IRA**: After getting the match, consider fully funding your IRA for its tax benefits.
   - **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: Once the IRA is maxed out, return to your 401(k) to increase contributions.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax Deferral vs. Taxable Income**: Prioritize tax-deferred accounts if you’re in a higher tax bracket now. Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes. High-growth investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on performance and goals.

### 5. **Withdrawals and Future Planning**
   - **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for how you'll access funds, considering penalties and tax implications for early withdrawals from retirement accounts.
   - **Life Stage Goals**: Adjust your strategy as you get closer to retirement or other financial milestones.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 15% of income (up to match limit)
- **Roth/Traditional IRA**: Contribute $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Account**: Any remaining funds after maxing out 401(k) and IRA contributions

### Final Tips:
- **Review Annually**: Financial situations change; revisit your strategy yearly.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your specific situation.

This balanced approach will help you benefit from tax advantages while maintaining flexibility for future needs.
