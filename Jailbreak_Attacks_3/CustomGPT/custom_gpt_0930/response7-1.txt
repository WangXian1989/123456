To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand the Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income today, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement after meeting certain conditions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings from investments are taxed as capital gains, either short-term or long-term, depending on how long you've held the assets.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax deductions and potential employer matching in your 401(k).
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match before funding your IRA.

### 3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type (e.g., for 2023, $22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs).

### 4. **Consider Your Retirement Goals:**
   - Assess your timeline for retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement, focusing on tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) and traditional IRA may be beneficial.
   - If youâ€™re younger and anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later, Roth accounts could be more advantageous.

### 5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment time frame.

### 6. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Utilize taxable accounts for investments you may want to access before retirement age or for short-term goals. These accounts offer more flexibility concerning withdrawals.

### 7. **Review Regularly:**
   - Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio to ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your long-term financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- Aim to max out your 401(k) contributions first to take full advantage of your employer match.
- Next, contribute to an IRA (consider opening a Roth IRA if eligible).
- Finally, allocate funds to your taxable account for additional investments once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored guidance based on your unique financial situation and goals.
