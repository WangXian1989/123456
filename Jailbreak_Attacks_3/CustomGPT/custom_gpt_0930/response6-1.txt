Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should consider factors like tax implications, investment goals, and your current financial situation. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:**
     - **Employer Match:** Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
     - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions reduce your taxable income now.
   - **IRA Contributions:**
     - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Consider your tax situation. A Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA allows tax-deductible contributions now.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Use these for investments with less favorable tax treatment (e.g., short-term gains) and for funds you'll need in the short term.

### 2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) and IRA):**
     - Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, mutual funds) since these accounts benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes and look for opportunities to tax-loss harvest.

### 3. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review your investment portfolio annually or semi-annually to ensure your allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - In retirement, consider the order of withdrawals to minimize taxes: typically, you would withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Age and Time Horizon:** Younger investors might lean towards higher-risk, higher-reward investments, while those nearing retirement may favor more stable options.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personalized advice based on your specific situation can enhance your financial strategies.

This distribution strategy helps optimize your tax situation and aligns your investments with your financial goals.
