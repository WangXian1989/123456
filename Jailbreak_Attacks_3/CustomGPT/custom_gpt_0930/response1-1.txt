Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situations, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maxing out the employer match, prioritize contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation).
   - Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, while withdrawals are taxed as income.
   - Roth contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

4. **Fund Taxable Accounts Last**:
   - Use taxable accounts for any funds exceeding your retirement account limits.
   - These accounts may incur capital gains taxes, but they provide flexibility if you need to access funds earlier than retirement.

5. **Assess Risk Tolerance**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and age.
   - Generally, younger investors can afford to take more risks, while those closer to retirement may prefer more conservative investments.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on market performance, changes in income, and any shifts in your financial goals.
