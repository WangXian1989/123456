Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves understanding the purpose of each account type, your financial goals, and your tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings.
   - **Short-term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for money you'll need in the near future.

### 2. **Contribute to Employer-sponsored 401(k)**
   - **Maximize Matching Contributions:** Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, you can contribute up to $23,000 (or $30,000 if age 50+).

### 3. **Consider an IRA**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:**
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible. Withdrawals are taxed as income.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax income. Withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use these for investments that may generate short-term gains or dividend income.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to limit capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Adjust Allocation Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**
   - **Younger Individuals:** May benefit from aggressive growth strategies, focusing heavily on equities.
   - **Older Individuals:** Might favor bonds and stable investments as retirement approaches.

### 6. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Review your asset allocation yearly or after major life changes to ensure it aligns with your goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're uncertain, working with a professional can provide personalized guidance based on your financial situation.

This strategy aims to maximize growth while considering tax implications and financial goals.
