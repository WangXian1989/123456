When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and IRAs typically offer tax advantages, either through tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (in the case of Roth accounts). 
   - Taxable accounts are taxed on dividends and capital gains, which can affect your total returns.

2. **Retirement Goals**:
   - Determine your retirement timeline and how much you will need to withdraw from each account type. 
   - If your retirement is more than a decade away, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the maximum contribution for a 401(k) is $22,500 (with a catch-up contribution of $7,500 for those aged 50 and older), and for IRAs, it’s $6,500 (with a catch-up of $1,000).

4. **Investment Choices**:
   - Consider the types of investments available within each account. Some 401(k) plans may have limited investment options compared to IRAs or taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Understand the rules around withdrawals in each account. Withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s may come with penalties before age 59½.

6. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Align your investments with your risk tolerance. Consider holding more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (like bonds) in your taxable accounts to minimize tax on income.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Complex situations can benefit from professional advice to create a strategy that aligns with your financial goals.

A balanced approach typically involves maxing out employer matches in your 401(k), contributing to an IRA (especially if you can use a Roth IRA), and then investing in your taxable accounts. This strategy helps ensure you are taking advantage of tax benefits while also maintaining liquidity for short-term needs.
