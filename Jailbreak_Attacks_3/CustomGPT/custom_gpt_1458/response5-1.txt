(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Generally, here are some strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: First, consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, invest in your IRA (traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits. 

2. **Tax Strategies**: A Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later. For traditional IRAs and 401(k)s, you get a tax deduction now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.

3. **Taxable Accounts Optimization**: Use taxable accounts for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Also, consider holding tax-efficient investments, such as index funds, in these accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your portfolio is well-diversified across all accounts to mitigate risk. 

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your investment goals and market conditions. 

It's wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your personal circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down! When it comes to distributing your cash among your accounts, you want to be smart about it. 

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer offers a match, throw enough into your 401(k) to get that free money. Itâ€™s like finding cash on the sidewalkâ€”why wouldnâ€™t you? 

2. **IRA Time**: Next, hit up your IRA. Depending on whether you go traditional or Roth, you get to play around with tax benefits that can drastically change your retirement game. Roths are cool because you pay taxes now, but then itâ€™s all smooth sailing tax-wise later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If youâ€™ve got any dough left, put it in your taxable accounts. Just make sure youâ€™re picking investments with favorable tax treatment, like ETFs or low-turnover funds, so Uncle Sam isnâ€™t swiping too much when you cash out.

4. **Mix it Up**: Donâ€™t forget to diversify across the board! Spread the loveâ€”stocks, bonds, whatever it is youâ€™re comfortable with. 

5. **Keep it Fresh**: And last but not least, keep an eye on your allocations and shake things up every now and then as needed to keep everything balanced. 

And hey, if youâ€™re feeling overwhelmed, hitting up a financial advisor is never a bad move!
