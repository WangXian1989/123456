When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some general guidelines you can consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If you’re eligible, contribute the maximum amount to your 401(k). Traditional contributions reduce your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can start investing in taxable accounts. This allows flexibility in accessing funds, but keep tax implications in mind.

4. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place investments that produce high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Stocks, which may appreciate more and be taxed more favorably, can be held in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified to mitigate risk across all accounts. 

6. **Ongoing Review**: Regularly review and rebalance your allocations based on performance and changes in financial goals or tax laws.

It’s often advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor these strategies specifically for your situation.
