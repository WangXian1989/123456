When distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors such as your financial goals, investment horizon, risk tolerance, and tax implications. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers tax deferral on your contributions.

2. **Focus on Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider your risk tolerance when deciding how to allocate your investments. Younger investors might focus more on growth-oriented investments (like stocks), while those nearing retirement may want more conservative investments (like bonds).

3. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   - Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can start putting money into taxable accounts. This is also useful for investments that you might want to access before retirement age without penalties.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - In retirement, be strategic about how you withdraw from these accounts to minimize tax liabilities. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and leave tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) for last.

5. **Diversify Across Accounts**:
   - It may be beneficial to have a mix of investments across all types of accounts to optimize growth and provide flexibility in managing taxes as you draw from these funds in retirement.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It's often useful to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

By structuring your contributions in this way, you can make the most of your investments and potentially enhance your retirement savings.
