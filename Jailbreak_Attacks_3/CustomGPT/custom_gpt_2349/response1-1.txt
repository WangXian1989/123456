The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Maximize contributions if you can, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket, since contributions are made pre-tax.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, you might choose either a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Roth IRAs may be more beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might yield lower capital gains taxes or for investments you may need to access before retirement age. Be mindful of tax implications and consider tax-efficient investments.

**Strategy**: A common approach is to prioritize contributions in the following order:
- First, contribute to the 401(k) to receive any employer match.
- Then, consider maxing out an IRA if it offers better tax advantages.
- Finally, allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts.

It's advisable to periodically reassess your strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
