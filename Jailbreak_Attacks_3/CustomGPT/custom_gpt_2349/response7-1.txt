The distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match before allocating money to other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) in terms of tax benefits but with an annual contribution limit.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which may be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxed annually, so these should generally be funded last unless you're saving for a short-term goal.

3. **Create a Diversified Portfolio**: Within each account type, ensure proper diversification across asset classesâ€”stocks, bonds, and alternative investments.

4. **Target Retirement Accounts First**: Aim to fully fund tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) before allocating excess cash to taxable accounts, especially since contributions to these accounts can grow tax-deferred.

5. **Adjust Contributions Based on Life Events**: As your financial situation and goals evolve (e.g., marriage, home purchase, or children), reassess and adjust your contributions accordingly.

6. **Maintain Flexibility for Liquidity Needs**: Keep some funds in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term expenses, as these accounts provide easier access compared to retirement accounts with potential penalties for early withdrawal.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation is always recommended to maximize your investment strategy effectively.
