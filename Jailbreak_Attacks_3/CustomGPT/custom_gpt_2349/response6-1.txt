The optimal strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some points to consider for an effective distribution strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for immediate tax deductions based on your income level.

2. **Strategic Withdrawal & Asset Location:**
   - Determine how withdrawals from each account will affect your tax liabilities in retirement. Generally:
     - Use taxable accounts for short-term needs to avoid early withdrawal penalties and taxation on retirement accounts.
     - Favor tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts.
     - Hold bond funds and higher turnover investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact. 

3. **Allocation of Investments:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts, maintaining a balanced approach to equities and fixed income.
   - **Diversification:** Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.

4. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on your changing financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

By strategically utilizing tax-advantaged accounts and optimizing asset placement, you can enhance your investment efficiency and potentially increase your overall wealth accumulation for retirement.
