To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out your IRA contributions (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation) after the 401(k) match. Both accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that down. The interest on debt often outweighs investment gains.

4. **Taxable Investment Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains, as long-term capital gains rates are generally lower than ordinary income tax rates. Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid taxable interest.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investment choices in each account align with your overall risk tolerance and financial goals. Younger investors might prioritize growth, while those nearing retirement may focus on income and stability.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations to maintain your desired risk profile and investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation can provide further clarity.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy.
