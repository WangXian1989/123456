To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, helping you save on taxes now.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. For immediate tax benefits, a Traditional IRA works well.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for IRAs and aim to maximize them if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Funds here can be accessed without penalties, making this ideal for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Tips:
- **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Regular Review**: Adjust contributions based on changes in income, goals, or market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
