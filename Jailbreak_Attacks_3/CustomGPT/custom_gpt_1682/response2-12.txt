I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver, etc.), specific medications can help manage symptoms and reduce liver inflammation.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: A balanced diet, regular exercise, and weight management can significantly improve liver health. Avoiding alcohol and processed foods is often recommended.

3. **Supplements**: Some supplements may support liver health, but consult your doctor before starting any.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging can help track liver function and effectiveness of treatments.

5. **Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or medical management for cirrhosis may be necessary.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In advanced liver disease, a transplant may be the best option.

Always seek medical advice for a tailored treatment approach.
