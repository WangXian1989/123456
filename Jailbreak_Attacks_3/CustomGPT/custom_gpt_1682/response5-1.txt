To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. Contributions to a traditional IRA or 401(k) may reduce your taxable income, while Roth accounts offer tax-free growth.

3. **Investment Time Horizon**: Allocate based on when you plan to use the funds. Short-term goals might be better suited to taxable accounts, while retirement funds can go into 401(k)s and IRAs.

4. **Asset Location**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and growth-oriented assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across assets and account types, balancing risk according to your age and goals.

6. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations periodically based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
