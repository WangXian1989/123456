To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-term Needs**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Diversify further, as you have more investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., ETFs, index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.
   - **Roth IRA**: Great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 5. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain desired risk levels.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (not in retirement accounts) to avoid early withdrawals.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 30%
- **IRA**: 20%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 50%

### Final Thoughts
Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
