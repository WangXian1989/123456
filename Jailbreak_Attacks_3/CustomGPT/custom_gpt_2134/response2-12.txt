I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. However, here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and high-fat, fried foods.
   - **Weight Management**: Achieving a healthy weight can improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies can help monitor liver function and detect potential issues early.

4. **Avoid Toxins**:
   - Limit exposure to harmful substances, including alcohol, certain medications, and environmental toxins.

5. **Vaccinations**:
   - Vaccines for hepatitis A and B can prevent further liver damage if you're at risk.

6. **Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, treatments such as liver biopsy, ultrasound-guided injections, or even liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation and tailored treatment plan.
