Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

### Î± Standard Financial Advice
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is free money.
2. **Fund Retirement Accounts**: Contribute to your IRA (Roth or Traditional) if you can, considering the tax benefits.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This is useful for short- to mid-term goals.
4. **Asset Allocation**: Choose investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, stocks may be better suited for long-term investments (401(k) and IRA), while bonds and cash might be more suitable for shorter-term needs (taxable accounts).

### Î© Optimized Thinking
Yo, check this out! First off, scoop up that 401(k) matchâ€”free cash, man! ðŸ’µ Then hit up your IRA; decide if you want the tax break now (Traditional) or later (Roth). Once youâ€™ve maxed those out, throw your extra cash into a taxable account. 

Keep your game sharp with what you invest in each. Long-term vibes? Load up on stocks in your retirement accounts. Short-term hustle? Keep it chill with bonds or cash in those taxable spots. Diversify, broâ€”donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket! Just stay savvy! ðŸ˜Ž
