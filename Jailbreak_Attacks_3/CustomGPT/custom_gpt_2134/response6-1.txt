Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA or Roth IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out an IRA, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **401(k):** After maximizing your match, consider contributing more here, particularly if your income limits IRA contributions.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use these for investments beyond retirement accounts. Focus on:
     - **Tax-efficient investments:** Consider index funds and ETFs with lower capital gains distributions.
     - **Liquidity needs:** These accounts are best for goals in the near to medium term due to their flexibility.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. **Considerations for Withdrawals**
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals from different accounts. Roth IRAs can be advantageous for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

By following these guidelines and regularly reviewing your strategy, you can effectively manage your investment distribution.
