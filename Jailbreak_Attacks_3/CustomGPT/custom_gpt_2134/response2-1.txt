Distributing your money effectively across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves multiple factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) if it's a traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, which can be minimized through tax-loss harvesting.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) if your employer offers matching contributions, as it’s essentially free money.
   - Follow this with contributions to an IRA, focusing on a Roth IRA if you qualify and expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Favor tax-advantaged accounts for higher-tax investments (like bonds) to minimize tax impact.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, and hold them long-term to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on your age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. Younger individuals can afford more equities, while those closer to retirement should consider more bonds or stable investments.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically assess your portfolio and make adjustments to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

### Example Distribution**
- **40% in 401(k)**: Maximize employer match and deferred taxes.
- **30% in IRA**: Don’t forget to maximize this for tax-deferral or tax-free growth.
- **30% in Taxable Accounts**: For liquidity and to utilize tax-efficient investments.

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy to your unique situation, consulting a financial advisor if needed. Regularly review and adjust your portfolio based on changing circumstances or goals.
