I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit saturated fats, sugars, and salt.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver issue, doctors may prescribe medications to treat viral infections (like hepatitis), autoimmune disorders, or to manage symptoms.

3. **Avoid Alcohol**: If liver disease is connected to alcohol use, abstaining from alcohol is essential.

4. **Manage Underlying Conditions**: Treating conditions like diabetes, high cholesterol, or obesity can improve liver health.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up tests and appointments to monitor liver function and disease progression.

6. **Advanced Treatments**: In severe cases, treatments such as liver transplant may be necessary.

Always seek medical guidance for your specific situation.
