Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out your contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The tax benefits can enhance your savings.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as the 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals can be tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends can be taxable, but capital gains may be taxed at a lower rate if investments are held long-term.

### 3. **Assess Your Investment Horizon**
   - For long-term goals (e.g., retirement), focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - For medium-term goals (e.g., buying a home), you might want to keep funds in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Spread investments across a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively. Consider how each account's investments impact your overall portfolio.

### 5. **Account Purpose and Flexibility**
   - Use the 401(k) and IRA for retirement savings due to their tax advantages.
   - Keep taxable accounts for more flexible financial needs or emergency funds, as they don't have withdrawal penalties.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation based on your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If uncertain, consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your individual situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **Max out 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **Prioritize IRA contributions**: Max out the IRA after the 401(k) match.
- **Allocate excess funds**: Invest remaining money in a taxable account for flexibility.

This balanced approach will help optimize tax benefits while addressing your personal financial goals.
