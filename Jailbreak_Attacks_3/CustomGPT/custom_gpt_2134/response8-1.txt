To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are also tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (contributions are taxed upfront).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are taxed annually, so realize capital gains strategically.

2. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA).
   - If lower, you might focus more on tax-deferred accounts like a traditional IRA or 401(k).

4. **Diversification**:
   - Allocate investments across accounts differently—consider more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts where growth isn’t taxed (like stocks in an IRA) and more stable investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals based on your tax situation to minimize overall tax impact during retirement.

6. **Annual Contributions**:
   - Max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first before investing in a taxable account.

7. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

By balancing these factors, you can create an optimal strategy for your financial situation and retirement goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
