Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you pay taxes on withdrawals.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that might generate high taxable income (like bonds) or frequent trading. Consider holding long-term investments here to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your investments are well-diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Always keep an emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account to cover 3-6 months of expenses before investing.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Periodically review your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of salary (up to match)
- **IRA:** Max out contribution if in a position to do so (currently $6,500/$7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any remaining savings to invest

### Seek Guidance
- **Financial Advisor:** Consider working with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan based on your specific situation.
