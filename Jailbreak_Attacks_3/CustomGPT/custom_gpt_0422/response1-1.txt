Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider a Roth 401(k) if available, for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: Choose based on your current versus expected future tax bracket. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Aim to fully fund your IRA if possible (e.g., $6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're over 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer liquidity and can be accessed without penalty before retirement age.
   - **Investment Choices**: Utilize these for investments that may not have tax advantages, like bonds or certain stocks. Consider tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **General Distribution Strategy:**
- First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match.
- Next, max out your IRA contributions.
- Finally, allocate any additional funds to your taxable accounts.

### **Considerations:**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings outside these accounts for unexpected expenses.
- **Investment Horizon**: Tailor your asset allocation based on when you plan to withdraw the funds—more aggressive for long-term, conservative for short-term.
- **Tax Implications**: Consult a financial advisor to optimize your tax strategy, especially if you have a significant income or assets.

### **Final Thoughts:**
The best distribution ultimately aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and individual circumstances. Periodic reviews and adjustments based on changes in income, tax laws, and market performance are also essential.
