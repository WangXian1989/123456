When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to take into account, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to obtain the full match before considering other accounts. This is essentially free money and a good return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, depending on income limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've contributed to retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and can be advantageous for short-term goals or varied investment strategies.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate investments among these accounts based on your investment strategy. For example, higher-risk investments might be placed in tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) to benefit from potential tax deferral or tax-free withdrawals.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. Interest-bearing assets are often best held in tax-advantaged accounts, while assets expected to generate capital gains might be more beneficial in taxable accounts due to favorable capital gains tax rates.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think ahead about how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Different accounts may have different rules and tax implications for withdrawals.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your unique financial situation, goals, and preferences. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your circumstances.
