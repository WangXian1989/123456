Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors like your income level, tax situation, and retirement goals. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After hitting the match, prioritize maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, especially if they have tax benefits. Traditional accounts let you defer taxes, while Roth accounts allow tax-free growth.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts After Tax-Advantaged**: Once you max out your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in a taxable account. This gives you more flexibility with your investments and withdrawals but doesn't offer the same tax advantages.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within those accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, younger investors might lean more towards stocks, while those closer to retirement might want to shift to bonds.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, a financial advisor can help craft a strategy tailored to your unique situation.

Always consider your long-term goals and any changes in financial circumstances.
