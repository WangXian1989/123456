Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some considerations for each account type:

### **1. 401(k)**
- **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
- **Employer Match**: Max out contributions to take advantage of any employer matching.
- **Contribution Limits**: Familiarize yourself with annual contribution limits.

### **2. IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Tax Considerations**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions for contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Roth Option for Growth**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### **3. Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more liquidity and can be used for immediate goals without penalties.
- **Capital Gains Taxes**: Be mindful of tax implications on gains and income generated.

### **General Strategy**
1. **Max Out Employer Match** in your 401(k) first.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**, focusing on a Roth if eligible and advantageous for your situation.
3. Use any additional funds for **taxable accounts**, especially for short- to medium-term goals.

### **Final Tips**
- **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts.
- **Review Regularly**: Monitor and adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and tax policies.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
