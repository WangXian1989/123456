Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations to optimize for taxes, growth, and retirement needs. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions, tax-deferred growth, taxes on withdrawals.
   - **IRA:** Similar tax treatment as 401(k), options for traditional and Roth IRAs.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but more flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **Contribute to 401(k):** Aim to max out to receive any employer matching contributions.
   - **Contribute to IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it’s a Roth IRA which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Balance Between Accounts:**
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Hold investments in taxable accounts that have lower tax implications (e.g., index funds or qualified dividends).
   - **Growth Investments:** Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments to benefit from tax deferment.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now but expect to retire in a lower bracket, favor pretax contributions. Conversely, if you expect your tax rate to rise, consider Roth options.

### 5. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs:**
   - Maintain a sufficient liquid cash reserve outside of retirement accounts for unexpected expenses.

### 6. **Adjust Based on Life Stage:**
   - Younger investors might prioritize growth in taxable accounts, while those nearing retirement should reassess for income needs.

### 7. **Periodic Review and Adjustments:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on goals, market conditions, and changes in tax law.

### Summary:
Start with maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, maintain growth-oriented investments in those accounts, and use taxable accounts for flexibility. Regularly assess and adjust as needed. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation.
