Distributing your money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for optimizing your retirement savings and minimizing tax liabilities. Here’s a strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (If Applicable)**
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA**: Consider funding your IRA (Traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) match, especially if you qualify for tax-deductible contributions or tax-free growth with a Roth IRA.
   - **401(k)**: If you can, increase contributions up to the maximum allowed by the IRS, especially if your company provides a high match.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions. These accounts offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investment choices.

### 4. **Consider Investment Options**
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment choices. Focus on a diversified mix of funds (stocks, bonds, etc.).
   - **IRA**: You have broader investment options. Choose funds that align with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient funds; low-turnover index funds can help minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - For high-income years, prioritize tax-deductible contributions to Traditional accounts. During lower-income years, consider Roth contributions to take advantage of lower tax rates.

### 6. **Continuous Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and life circumstances. Adjust your contributions to ensure that your long-term goals remain on track.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **Multiplier Effect**:
  - 401(k) (up to match): 5% – 10%
  - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50)
  - Max out 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50)
  - Additional savings in a taxable account: Remaining funds

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions across these accounts while considering your current financial situation, tax implications, and investment goals will help you build a secure retirement. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
