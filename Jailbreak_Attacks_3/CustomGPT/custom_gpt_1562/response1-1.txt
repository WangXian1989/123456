Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to maximize any employer match first; this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deferral**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, growing tax-deferred until withdrawal.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Benefits**: If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. A traditional IRA offers tax deductions on contributions.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits and phase-outs based on income.

### 3. **Taxable Investment Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Provides the most flexibility and access to your money without penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider long-term investments to benefit from lower tax rates on capital gains.

### **Suggested Allocation Strategy**
- **Start with 401(k)**: Max out the match.
- **Then Fund IRA**: Contribute to your IRA, prioritizing Roth if applicable.
- **Last, Fund Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to retirement accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts for growth and flexibility.

### **Considerations**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings set aside for emergencies (3-6 months of expenses).
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust allocations based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Review Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor. They can provide insights based on current tax laws and your overall financial plan. 

This approach will help you maximize your investment growth while minimizing tax implications over time!
