Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a general framework to optimize your distribution:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k) Accounts**: Often include employer matching, tax-deferred growth, and may offer loan options.
- **IRA Accounts**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax; more flexibility on withdrawals compared to retirement accounts.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
- **Max Out 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it's essentially free money.
- **Contribute to IRA**: Maximize either a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation.

### 3. Consider Investment Strategy
- **401(k)**: Generally, focus on a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.
- **IRA**: Depending on the type, consider a mix of growth-focused investments for long-term gains.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate capital gains or dividends in tax-efficient vehicles. 

### 4. Tax Implications
- **Tax-deferred Accounts**: Like 401(k) and Traditional IRA, tax liabilities are deferred until withdrawal.
- **Roth IRA**: Offers tax-free growth, ideal for younger investors expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Aim for investments with lower turnover rates to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. Assess Your Goals
- Short-term needs vs. long-term growth: Maintain liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies and use retirement accounts for long-term growth.

### 6. Rebalance Regularly
- Adjust allocations based on market performance and changes in your risk tolerance or financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
| Account Type      | Contribution Priority | Notes                              |
|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| **401(k)**        | High                 | Max out to employer match.         |
| **IRA**           | Mid                  | Consider your tax situation.       |
| **Taxable**       | Low                  | Use for short-term needs.          |

### Conclusion
The optimal distribution depends on your specific situation. A financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations tailored to your goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.
