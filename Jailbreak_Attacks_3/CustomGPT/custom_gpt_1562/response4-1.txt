Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Here’s a general guide to help you make a decision:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account that can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). Offers tax advantages for retirement savings.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax but offer flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: After maxing out the match, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you’re eligible for a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Fill 401(k)**: If you're able, increase contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Both 401(k) and traditional IRA allow for tax-deferred growth, meaning you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains, as they can be taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Typically better for long-term growth; focus on diversified funds based on risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Similar to 401(k) but with potentially more investment options. Consider your retirement timeframe.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for more liquid investments or those needed in the short to medium term. Consider tax-efficient funds.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired allocation and risk level.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Depending on your situation, a professional can provide tailored advice to optimize your investment strategy.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
- **60% - 401(k)**
- **30% - IRA**
- **10% - Taxable Accounts**

This is just a guideline; adjust percentages based on your goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline.

### Final Thoughts
Your distribution strategy should align with your overall financial goals. Regularly assess your financial situation to make informed adjustments.
