To create a well-balanced investment strategy, consider these steps:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon for each account.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize your employer's matching contributions first, as this is essentially "free" money.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income level, consider whether a Traditional or Roth IRA aligns better with your tax strategy.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that may produce taxable income, such as stocks with high potential for capital growth or investments in tax-efficient funds.

5. **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk in all accounts.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your target asset mix based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
