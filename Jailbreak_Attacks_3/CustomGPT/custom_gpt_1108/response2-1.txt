The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some straightforward guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is free money.

2. **Fund IRA Next**: If youâ€™re eligible, contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) for potential tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. This offers flexibility and access to funds.

4. **Consider Asset Placement**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your allocations based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Professional**: If uncertain, seek advice from a financial planner for tailored strategies.

Make decisions based on your specific situation.
