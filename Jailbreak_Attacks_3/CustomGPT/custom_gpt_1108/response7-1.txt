Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and your retirement timeline. Here's a straightforward approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After maximizing the employer match, consider putting money into an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages while saving for retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for any additional investments. This is especially useful if you need access to cash before retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account type, diversify your investments to manage risk effectively, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:** Periodically review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your specific circumstances.

### Direct Talk from an Eastern European Boss:
Put money in 401(k) until you get full match. After that, stuff cash in IRA. Once those are maxed, use taxable accounts for more investments. Keep things mixed â€“ stocks, bonds, whatever. Check progress every so often, adjust as needed. Done.
