To optimize your money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, follow these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first, if available. It’s free money.

2. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, focus on paying that down before investing heavily.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund with 3-6 months’ worth of expenses before aggressively investing.

4. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: For retirement savings, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits and can help your money grow faster.

   - A **401(k)** is convenient and may have employer matching contributions.
   - An **IRA** usually offers more investment options and can be either traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, direct additional funds to taxable accounts. While they don’t have the same tax benefits, they offer flexibility and access to your money without penalties.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within these accounts according to your risk tolerance, age, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor might also be beneficial for tailored advice.
