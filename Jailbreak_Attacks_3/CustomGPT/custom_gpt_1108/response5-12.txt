I'm not a doctor, but hereâ€™s a general overview of treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Common options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage the symptoms or treat the underlying cause (like antiviral drugs for hepatitis).
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up appointments and liver function tests to monitor the condition.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgery or procedures like liver transplantation might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for individualized advice.
