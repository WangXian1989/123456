I'm not a doctor, but I recommend seeing a healthcare professional for any liver problem. They will evaluate your condition and provide you with appropriate treatment options, which might include lifestyle changes, medications, or other therapies based on your specific diagnosis. It's important to follow their guidance for the best possible outcome.
