(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, it's recommended to prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this provides an immediate return on your investment. After that, consider contributing to an IRA for potential tax benefits. Finally, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts for additional flexibility and liquidity. It's also beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your individual situation.

Then, max out your IRA to really sock it away with some nice tax perks. Whateverâ€™s left? Throw it in taxable accounts. Those give you flexibility when youâ€™re ready to party in retirement. Just remember, avoid tax traps and donâ€™t go overboard. If you need a solid plan, get a financial advisor to whip your assets into shape.
