Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your investment goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can afford to contribute more after maximizing the employer match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Further Fund Your 401(k)**: After fully funding your IRA, go back to your 401(k) and contribute additional funds, especially if your goal is to maximize retirement savings.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds left over, you can begin to invest in taxable accounts. This option provides more flexibility in terms of withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Ensure that you're not overly concentrated in any one investment within any account. Aim for a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Remember that investment gains in a 401(k) and IRA are tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of Roth accounts), while taxable accounts will incur taxes on dividends and realized gains.

7. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your distribution strategy periodically, especially as your financial situation or goals change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
