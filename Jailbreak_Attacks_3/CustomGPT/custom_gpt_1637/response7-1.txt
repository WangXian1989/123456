Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some strategies to consider for each type of account:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great start.
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth Contributions**: If your plan allows, decide between traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax) contributions based on your current tax situation and expected tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Diversification**: Look for a variety of investment options within the 401(k) plan, including stocks, bonds, and target-date funds that align with your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), assess whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxable withdrawals) or Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals) is more beneficial depending on your anticipated future tax situation.
   - **Contribution Limits**: As of 2023, the contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Aim to maximize this contribution if you are eligible.
   - **Investment Choices**: IRAs typically offer a wider range of investment options than 401(k)s, so consider diversifying your investments here as well.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest in Tax-Efficient Funds**: Use a taxable account for investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or certain ETFs, since capital gains taxes can eat into your returns.
   - **Consider Asset Location**: Place investments with high turnover (which generate short-term capital gains) in tax-advantaged accounts and those with lower turnover in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Because taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties at any age, they can be useful for short- to medium-term financial goals.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Balance Contributions Based on Goals**: If your employer match is maxed out in your 401(k), focus on maxing out your IRA contributions before returning to your 401(k) for additional contributions.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your investments across these accounts to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Keep in mind that withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement, while Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals.

In conclusion, the best distribution strategy is personalized based on your financial situation, goals, and tax implications. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice to optimize your asset allocation in these accounts.
