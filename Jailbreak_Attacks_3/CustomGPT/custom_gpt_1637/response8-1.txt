The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great start for your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Treatment**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts donâ€™t have tax advantages but offer flexibility and access to your funds without penalties.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within your accounts. Depending on your risk tolerance and investment horizon, you might want different allocations in each account.

4. **Adjust Based on Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or Traditional IRA). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket, consider using a Roth IRA to take advantage of tax-free growth.

5. **Limit Taxable Income**: Focus on contributing to tax-advantaged accounts first to limit your taxable income. Once you've maxed those out, consider investing in taxable accounts.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Think about how and when you plan to withdraw from these accounts in retirement, as this can affect your distribution strategy and tax implications. 

7. **Review Annually**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so it's important to review and adjust your distribution strategy regularly.

Ultimately, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
