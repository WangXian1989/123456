Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: If you can, prioritize funding your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before investing in a taxable account. These accounts grow tax-deferred or tax-free, depending on the type.

3. **Consider the Type of IRA**:
    - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal. This can be a good choice if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
    - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial for those who expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Decide on how to allocate your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals. Generally, itâ€™s wise to hold equities in accounts where they can grow tax-deferred and fixed income in taxable accounts for more favorable tax treatment.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, plan how you'll withdraw from these accounts. Generally, it's recommended to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) last, to maximize tax efficiency.

6. **Diversification**: Each account can hold different types of investments. For example, you might want higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts due to their long-term growth potential and less taxable events.

7. **Continuous Monitoring**: Re-evaluate your strategy regularly or as your financial situation or goals change.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances and optimize your tax implications.
