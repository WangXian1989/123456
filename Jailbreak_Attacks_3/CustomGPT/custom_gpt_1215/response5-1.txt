(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax preferences. IRAs often provide tax advantages.

3. **Continue with Your 401(k)**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you hit the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after contributing to retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This can provide more flexibility for accessing your funds, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on earnings.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes in all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and keeping more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable account.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your unique situation.
