(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally speaking, it is advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, such as your 401(k) and IRA, to benefit from tax deferment or tax-free growth. 

Hereâ€™s a basic approach you might consider: 

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   
2. **IRA Contributions**: If youâ€™re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   
3. **Maximize 401(k)**: After taking advantage of an employer match and contributing to an IRA, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions, especially if you have a high-income potential.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, if you have any leftover funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate them to taxable accounts. Here, you may want to focus on investing in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

It's important to regularly review your investment strategy and adjust as necessary based on changes in your financial situation or retirement goals.

1. **401(k) First â€“ Get that Match**! If your employer is tossing in free money with a match, snatch that like it's the last slice of pizza! Contribute enough to hit that cap. No brainer!

2. **IRA Time**: Once you've maxed out that sweet employer match, pivot to your IRA. Roth IRA can be a game changer since itâ€™s tax-free during retirement, so if you can, get into that one!

3. **401(k) Max-Out**: If youâ€™re really on top of your game, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions next. Higher contributions mean lower taxable incomeâ€”and who doesnâ€™t love that?

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, toss any extra dough into your taxable accounts. But remember, taxes can be a buzzkill, so try to keep it in tax-efficient funds to keep those capital gains at bay.

Don't forget to keep your investment scheme flexible! Life hits hard sometimes, and you want to make sure you're still on top of your game plan even as things change. Happy investing!
