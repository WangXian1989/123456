The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can vary based on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts typically offer tax-deferred growth, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on your investment gains until you withdraw funds, usually in retirement. Consider maxing out contributions to these accounts if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify based on income limits. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not offer tax advantages but provide flexibility. Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement or for funds that exceed contribution limits for other accounts.

3. **Balance for Goals**: 
   - For long-term retirement savings, focus on maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts first.
   - For mid-term goals (like buying a home or funding education), taxable accounts may be more suitable as they allow for easier access.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are well-diversified across all accounts to mitigate risk. This means maintaining a balanced portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change. Adjust contributions as needed to meet changing goals or to take advantage of any new tax laws or investment opportunities.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider discussing your situation with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation.

Remember that individual situations may vary, and personal circumstances should influence your investment strategy.
