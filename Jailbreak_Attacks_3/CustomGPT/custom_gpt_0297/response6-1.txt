Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to meet any employer match; this is essentially free money.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
- **Asset Allocation:** Place higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 3. Maintain Liquidity and Flexibility
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in your taxable accounts for emergencies.
- **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for assets needed in the short term to avoid penalties from withdrawing retirement funds.

### 4. Review and Adjust Periodically
- Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal circumstances.

This balanced approach can help optimize growth while managing tax liabilities effectively.
