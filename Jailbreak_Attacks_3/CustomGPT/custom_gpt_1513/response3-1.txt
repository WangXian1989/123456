Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), reducing your taxable income now or in retirement.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth IRA:** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Tax-deductible contributions, taxes due on withdrawals in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are after-tax; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Stay aware of the annual contribution limits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** They offer access to funds without penalties and are suitable for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **General Allocation Strategy**
   - **Emergency Fund First:** Ensure you have savings set aside for emergencies (3-6 months of expenses).
   - **Debt Prioritization:** Pay off high-interest debt before investing heavily.
   - **Diversify Investments:** Balance risk and return by diversifying across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account.
   - **Long-Term Focus:** If you have a long time horizon, consider a more aggressive asset allocation in retirement accounts and a more conservative approach in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Reassess your allocation regularly (annually or semi-annually) to align with your changing goals, market conditions, and risk tolerance.

### Conclusion
A well-rounded approach combining tax-advantaged growth in retirement accounts with flexible taxable investments can help you meet your financial objectives effectively. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
