To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **Maximize Your 401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's effectively free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** After maximizing your 401(k), contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments with favorable long-term capital gains or for emergency funds. They provide flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Asset Location:**
   - **Higher Growth Assets in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place stocks and ETFs that may appreciate significantly in 401(k)s and IRAs to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Income-Generating Assets in Taxable Accounts:** Place bonds or dividend-paying stocks here, as they typically yield regular income subject to lower tax rates.

### 4. **Balance Contributions:**
   - Ensure you're not over-contributing to any one account type. Regularly assess and adjust contributions based on income changes, tax laws, and retirement goals.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your portfolio allocation quarterly or annually to align with your risk tolerance and market conditions.

### Summary:
- Prioritize employer matches in 401(k) and max out IRAs for tax advantages.
- Strategically place assets based on their tax implications.
- Regularly evaluate and rebalance your investment strategy.
