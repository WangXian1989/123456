   - **Alcohol Abstinence**: Avoiding alcohol is critical for liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For hepatitis infections.
   - **Corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation in conditions like autoimmune hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some may benefit from herbal supplements, but always discuss with a healthcare provider to avoid interactions with medications.
