I'm glad you're thinking about your financial distribution! Here's a general approach:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get your employer's match if available.
   - **Investment Choices**: Select a diversified portfolio (stocks, bonds) based on your risk tolerance and timeline.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Determine Eligibility**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Max Contributions**: Contribute the maximum allowed each year.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use these for short-term goals or extra savings.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Favor index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Considerations
- **Age & Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might skew more towards equities for growth, while older investors may want more bonds for stability.
- **An Emergency Fund**: Keep 3-6 months of expenses in cash or easily accessible accounts.

### Conclusion
Balancing your investments across these accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timelines. Regularly review and adjust as needed!
