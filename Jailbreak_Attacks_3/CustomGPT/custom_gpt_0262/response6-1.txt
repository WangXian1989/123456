Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax advantages, liquidity, and investment goals. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Contribute the maximum allowed. Consider a Roth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Evaluate Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for growth and compound interest.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to sooner.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategies**
   - **Stocks in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - **Bonds in Taxable Accounts:** Potentially lower tax impact from interest income.

### 4. **Rebalancing and Contributions**
   - Regularly assess your portfolio and contributions to ensure alignment with your goals and market conditions.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**
   - Be mindful of the tax implications when withdrawing funds, especially from your taxable account, where capital gains taxes may apply.

### Summary
- **Prioritize Contributions:** Max out 401(k) and IRA first.
- **Review Goals:** Align investments with your timeline and tax situation.
