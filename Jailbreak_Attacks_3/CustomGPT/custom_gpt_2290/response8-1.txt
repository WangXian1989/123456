To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before using taxable accounts. These accounts provide tax benefits that can enhance growth.

2. **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

3. **IRA Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the contribution limits for IRAs (traditional and Roth) and ensure youâ€™re adhering to them.

4. **Investment Choices**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes. Use taxable accounts for investments with favorable long-term capital gains treatment.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for withdrawals thoughtfully. Typically, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to minimize tax impacts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically and adjust based on market performance and your financial goals.

Before making decisions, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
