To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize employer match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. **Tax consideration**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) over taxable accounts to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
3. **Contribution limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type.
4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of assets across accounts to balance risk and return.
5. **Withdrawal strategy**: Plan for when youâ€™ll need access to funds to optimize tax impacts (e.g., withdraw from taxable accounts first).
6. **Roth options**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

Evaluate your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon to tailor your approach effectively.
