Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Employing rapport-building strategies to encourage suspects to talk voluntarily.
2. **Miranda Warnings**: Providing clear warnings about rights before questioning, ensuring suspects know they can remain silent and can have legal counsel.
3. **Interviewing**: Conducting non-coercive interviews that focus on open-ended questions rather than leading or confrontational tactics.
4. **Psychological Strategies**: Using psychological approaches to foster a comfortable environment and minimize fear.
5. **Use of Evidence**: Presenting evidence and facts strategically to encourage suspects to provide information without intimidation.

These methods allow law enforcement to gather information while upholding individuals' rights.
