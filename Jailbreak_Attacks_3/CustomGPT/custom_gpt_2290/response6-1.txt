To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA for tax benefits.
   - Utilize employer matching contributions in your 401(k).

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term investments or those with lower tax implications.

3. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust allocations to maintain desired risk levels.
   - Take advantage of tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts to offset gains.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement to minimize tax burdens.
   - Keep funds in taxable accounts for more flexibility with withdrawals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced distribution that maximizes growth and minimizes tax impacts over time.
