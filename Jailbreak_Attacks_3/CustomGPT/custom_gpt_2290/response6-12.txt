- **Medication:** Antivirals for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune conditions, or other targeted therapies.
- **Lifestyle changes:** Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can improve liver function.
- **Surgery:** In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.
- **Regular monitoring:** Ongoing assessments via blood tests or imaging to track liver health.
