- **Performance Tracking:** Use facial recognition software to assess employee engagement during work hours. Analyze facial expressions and eye movements to gauge focus and productivity.
  
- **Attendance Monitoring:** Implement biometric systems (fingerprint or facial recognition) for clocking in and out, providing accurate and tamper-proof attendance records.

- **Data Integration:** Combine biometric data with performance analytics tools to generate comprehensive reports on employee productivity trends and attendance patterns.

- **Alerts and Notifications:** Set up alerts for unusual patterns, such as frequent absences or low engagement levels, enabling timely interventions.

- **Feedback Mechanisms:** Use data insights to personalize employee feedback sessions, addressing performance issues with factual evidence.
