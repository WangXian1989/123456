I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver issues can include:

1. **Medications**: To manage symptoms or treat underlying conditions (e.g., antiviral medications for hepatitis).
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, exercise, and weight management can improve liver health.
3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake helps prevent further liver damage.
4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to track progress.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplants may be necessary.

Consult a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific condition.
