Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and timeline. Here’s a strategic overview:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **401(k)**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) to the annual limit if you’ve already maximized your IRA.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once you've utilized tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility in withdrawals and investment choices. 

### 4. **Diversification Within Accounts**
   - Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize taxes. Typically, it’s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (like 401(k)s), and lastly tax-free (like Roth IRAs).

### 6. **Reassess Periodically**
   - Regularly re-evaluate your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

### Conclusion
Maintain a balanced approach by leveraging the benefits of tax-advantaged accounts while ensuring you have liquidity in your taxable accounts. Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your personal circumstances.
