Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) based on your current tax situation and expected future tax rates. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: After funding your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit. Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income now, while Roth contributions do so later.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maxing your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in a taxable account. This provides more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can serve short-term goals.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, longer-term accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs can hold more aggressive investments, while taxable accounts might benefit from tax-efficient investments.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in your taxable accounts and the tax implications of withdrawing from tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Reassessment**: Regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy as your financial situation evolves.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
