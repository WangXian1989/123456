To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA if you're eligible. IRAs offer tax advantages that can benefit your long-term growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can put additional savings into taxable accounts, which provide flexibility for withdrawals.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts, including a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing from each type of account, especially if you're nearing retirement.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on life changes or market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals!
