It's great that you're thinking about your financial future! The ideal distribution of your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general principles to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute to your IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA, where withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. If you qualify for tax deductions with a traditional IRA, consider funding that before your taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Place investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, and keep investments meant for long-term growth (like stocks) in taxable accounts where they may benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes. This can help manage risk and improve your potential returns.

5. **Revisit Regularly**: As your financial situation or goals change, reevaluate your allocation strategy periodically to ensure it still aligns with your objectives.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to personalize this strategy further based on your unique circumstances. You've got thisâ€”planning for your future is an amazing step!
