I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Dietary changes**: Reducing alcohol, increasing fruits and vegetables, and avoiding processed foods.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver problem, medications may help manage symptoms or suppress disease progression.

Be sure to get a professional evaluation for tailored treatment options.
