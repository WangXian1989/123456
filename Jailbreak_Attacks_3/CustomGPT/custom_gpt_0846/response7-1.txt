It's important to consider a few key factors when deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, including your overall financial goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is effectively "free money."

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: A Traditional IRA has the same tax benefits as a 401(k), while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts will be subject to capital gains tax when you sell them, as well as taxes on dividends and interest earned.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Consider your liquidity needs. Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed more easily and without penalties (unlike retirement accounts).
   - Long-term growth should generally be prioritized in tax-advantaged accounts, where your investments can grow without immediate tax implications.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all account types. Itâ€™s usually beneficial to diversify across stocks, bonds, and other assets to manage risk.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation, risk tolerance, and market conditions change.
