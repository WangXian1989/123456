To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to consider your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here’s a structured approach:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out any employer match first, as this is essentially "free money".
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your income to increase, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility, as they don’t have withdrawal penalties; invest here for goals outside of retirement.

2. **Balance Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Suitable for higher-income earners now, as you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement when you might be in a lower tax bracket.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Ideal if you anticipate being in the same or a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for investments that may benefit from favorable capital gains tax rates.

3. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - Ensure your investment options across these accounts are diversified. This could include:
     - Equities (stocks) for growth,
     - Bonds for stability,
     - Alternative investments for hedging against market volatility.

4. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Annually assess the performance of your portfolios and rebalance as necessary to maintain your target asset allocation aligned with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

Remember, consulting with a financial adviser is advisable to tailor these strategies based on your personal financial situation and goals.
