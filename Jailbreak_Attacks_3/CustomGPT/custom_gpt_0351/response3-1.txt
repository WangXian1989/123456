Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fill Up IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, prioritize maxing out your IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional, depending on your income and tax situation).

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After maxing out the IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for any additional investments. They provide liquidity and flexibility, but be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a diversified asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Typically, hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher-growth assets in tax-deferred accounts.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly re-evaluate your distribution and strategy based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your individual circumstances.
