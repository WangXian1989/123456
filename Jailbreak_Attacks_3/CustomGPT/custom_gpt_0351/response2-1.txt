Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Max out employer match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **Contribution limit**: Aim to contribute up to the annual limit if possible for tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Tax advantages**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax bracket and retirement goals.
   - **Limit your contributions**: Stick to the contribution limits to maximize tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible access**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Consider capital gains**: Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize taxes on earnings.

### Strategy Tips:
- **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds) across all accounts.
- **Tax considerations**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating assets in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.
- **Rebalance periodically**: Adjust your allocation based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

### Conclusion:
Assess your situation annually and adjust your contributions accordingly for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
