Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general strategy that might help:

1. **Max Out Employer-Sponsored Plans (401(k)):** If your employer offers a 401(k) with matching contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA):** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your choice depends on your current tax bracket and expectations for retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable investment accounts. These offer more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account, ensure you have a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments.

5. **Account for Taxes:** Keep in mind the tax implications of each account. For example, it may be beneficial to hold bonds in a tax-deferred account to minimize annual tax burdens.

6. **Adjust Based on Your Situation:** Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and your financial goals.

Before making any significant decisions, it may be wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
