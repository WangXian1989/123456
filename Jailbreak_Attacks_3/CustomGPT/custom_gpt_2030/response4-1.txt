When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to keep in mind your financial goals, tax implications, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here’s a strategy to help guide your distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, while Roth 401(k) contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free growth.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify for a deductible IRA, consider contributing to an IRA next. This can provide further tax advantages, as contributions may reduce your taxable income. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial, offering tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you've maximized contributions to your retirement accounts. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawal and investment options but be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

5. **Consider Investment Options**: Diversifying your investments across these accounts can also be beneficial. For example, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth while keeping more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage risk.

6. **Review and Adjust Allocations**: Periodically review your allocations and rebalance as necessary. As you near retirement, gradually shifting towards more conservative investments can help preserve your capital.

It’s often helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your individual circumstances. They can provide personalized advice based on your total financial picture.
