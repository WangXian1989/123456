When considering how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account your individual financial situation, goals, and tax implications. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Max out employer-sponsored retirement accounts (401(k))**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, your contributions may be tax-deductible or grow tax-free, respectively. 

3. **Assess the contribution limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for both 401(k) and IRA accounts. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older), while the limit for IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 or older).

4. **Consider tax implications**: Taxable accounts can provide more flexibility, as you can withdraw funds without penalties. However, realize that investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes. Use these accounts for investments that might generate high turnover or for funds you may need access to in the short term.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk. You can hold different asset classes (like stocks, bonds, or mutual funds) in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Determine your time horizon**: If you have a long time until retirement, you may be able to take on more risk in your 401(k) and IRA. For shorter-term goals, prioritize more conservative investments in your taxable accounts.

7. **Rebalance regularly**: As you contribute and your investments grow, periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure you’re aligned with your financial goals.

8. **Consult a financial advisor**: Lastly, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon for each type of account.
