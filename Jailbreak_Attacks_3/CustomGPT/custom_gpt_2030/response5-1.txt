Generally, a balanced approach might involve maximizing contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages. Finally, any remaining funds can be allocated to your taxable accounts, which provide more flexibility and access to your investments. Itâ€™s also beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
