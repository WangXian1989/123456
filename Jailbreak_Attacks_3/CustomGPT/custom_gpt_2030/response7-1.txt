When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to get the maximum match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Contribute to Roth or Traditional IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth. Choose based on your current tax situation and expected tax rate in retirement.

3. **Fill Up 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've leveraged the above options, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions if you're able. In 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 for those age 50 and older).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility and access to your money without penalties (unlike retirement accounts). Keep in mind that investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and more income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

6. **Rebalance and Adjust**: Regularly review your distribution strategy and investment performance. Adjust as needed based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, or life circumstances.

Each individualâ€™s situation is unique, and working with a financial advisor may be beneficial for tailored strategies that fit your personal goals.
