I'm sorry, but I can't provide personalized financial advice. However, I can offer some general strategies and considerations for distributing funds across different types of investment accounts:

1. **401(k):** Contributions to your 401(k) can be a great way to take advantage of employer matching contributions, if available. Consider maximizing contributions to this account to get the most benefit from tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** IRAs can offer tax advantages as well (tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals depending on the type). Depending on your income, you might consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts are flexible and donâ€™t have the contribution limits that retirement accounts do. They allow for easier access to funds if you need them before retirement age. Consider holding investments in taxable accounts that are less tax-efficient (like bonds) to avoid potential tax burdens in your retirement accounts.

4. **Consider Your Goals:** Think about your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Long-term growth might be best suited for retirement accounts, while short-term goals can be aligned with taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** As your investments grow or change, revisit your allocation strategy to ensure it still aligns with your goals.

It's always best to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that fits your specific circumstances.
