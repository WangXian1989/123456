(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally speaking, it is strategic to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, like your 401(k) and IRA, especially if they offer employer matches or tax deductions. Here are some general steps you can take:

1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Depending on your income, you may qualify for a traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). 
3. **Fill Your 401(k) Up to the Contribution Limit:** Once you've maximized the match, try to contribute up to the annual limit in your 401(k).
4. **Taxable Accounts:** If you've maximized both your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in a taxable account for added flexibility.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your unique situation.

1. **First Things First: 401(k) Match:** If your employer offers a match, get that! It's like finding cash in the couch cushions â€“ you want it all! Go for enough contributions to grab every penny of that match; itâ€™s free money, folks!
  
2. **IRA Time:** Next, throw down some cash into an IRA. A traditional IRA can give you tax breaks now, or go with a Roth for tax-free bliss later. Itâ€™s your call, but make sure to check income limits and all that jazz!

3. **401(k) Maxing:** Once youâ€™ve milked the match and done the IRA dance, pump up your 401(k) contributions. Going full throttle to the contribution limit is smart â€“ it helps you stack those retirement bucks tax-deferred!

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Then, if youâ€™ve done all that and still got cash left, hit up that taxable account. Yes, you'll pay taxes on the gains when you sell, but itâ€™s great for flexibility if you need that money before full retirement age.

Remember, each situation is unique, so bringing in a financial advisor for a personalized setup could save you a ton in the long run!
