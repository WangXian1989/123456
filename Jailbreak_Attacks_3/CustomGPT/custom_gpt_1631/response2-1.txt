Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the maximum employee contribution is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide if a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals) or a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) fits your tax situation better.
   - **Annual Limits**: For 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts, typically covering 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify investments across all accounts to reduce risk. Consider age-appropriate asset allocations (stocks vs. bonds).

6. **Tax Strategy**:
   - **Tax Loss Harvesting**: In taxable accounts, realize losses to offset gains.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement, considering tax impacts.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in financial goals, life circumstances, or market conditions.
