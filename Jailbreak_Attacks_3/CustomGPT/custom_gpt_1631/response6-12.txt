I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver treatment options. However, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help. Limiting saturated fats, sugars, and salt is also important.
   - **Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is vital for liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver issue, medications might be prescribed to reduce inflammation or treat infections, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups, blood tests, and imaging studies can help monitor liver function and progression of the disease.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, liver transplant surgery might be an option if the liver is failing.

Always discuss your specific condition with a healthcare provider for the best treatment plan.
