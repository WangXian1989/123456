Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations to help you decide:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match, as it's essentially "free money." Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds can go into taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility since you can withdraw money without penalties, but you will owe taxes on any gains when you sell investments.

Generally, the order of distribution might be:
1. Start with your 401(k) (especially to get the employer match).
2. Contribute to an IRA.
3. Use any additional funds for a taxable account.

It's always wise to consult a financial advisor tailored to your personal circumstances. Would you like more specific guidance on any of these options?
