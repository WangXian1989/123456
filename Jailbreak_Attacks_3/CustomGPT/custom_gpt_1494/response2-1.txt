To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get that full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Balance Contributions**: After maximizing your employer match, focus on your IRA. Depending on your income level and tax filing status, your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA can provide substantial tax benefits.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate long-term capital gains or tax-efficient securities, such as index funds or ETFs. This reduces the tax bite compared to high-turnover investments, which are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification and Rebalancing**: Ensure that your overall investment portfolio (including all three account types) is well-diversified and aligns with your risk tolerance. Periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain desired asset allocation.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: When you're closer to retirement, think about your withdrawal strategy. Usually, you'd want to draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation, including your income, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. This could ensure you make informed decisions about your distribution strategy.
