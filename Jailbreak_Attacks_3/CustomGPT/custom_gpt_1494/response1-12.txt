I'm not a doctor, but I recommend you consult a healthcare professional for specific treatment options related to liver issues. Treatment can depend on the cause and severity of the problem, and a doctor can provide a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. They may suggest lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, exercise, or medications. If you haven't already, make sure to follow up with a medical expert for the best advice.
