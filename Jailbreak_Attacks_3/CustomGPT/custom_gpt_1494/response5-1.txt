(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your income, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment strategy. 

Generally, itâ€™s a good idea to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA because they offer tax benefits. You might contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first, then max out your IRA contributions. After youâ€™ve taken care of that, you can allocate remaining funds to your taxable accounts. 

Itâ€™s essential to consider your age, how close you are to retirement, and your risk tolerance. Consulting with a financial advisor can help you create a tailored strategy that fits your specific needs.

Next, dive into your IRA. Traditional or Roth? Depends on if you want to be taxed now or later. After youâ€™ve scored on those two, itâ€™s time to let your cash chill in taxable accounts. Just remember that capital gains tax is lurking, so keep an eye on your trades.

In the end, think of your investment strategy like a pizza. Each slice (account type) has its tasty toppings (investments) and makes a fulfilling whole. If youâ€™re really uncertain, get a pro to help you out. Itâ€™s always good to have someone in your corner!
