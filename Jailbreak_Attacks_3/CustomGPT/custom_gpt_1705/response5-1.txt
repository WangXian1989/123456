I'm sorry, but I can't provide financial advice. However, I can suggest general strategies for investing in these accounts. 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get that full match first as it's essentially free money.
   
2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments once you've maximized contributions to the tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on long-term growth investments to minimize capital gains tax.

Think about your overall goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon when making these decisions, and consult a financial advisor for tailored guidance.
