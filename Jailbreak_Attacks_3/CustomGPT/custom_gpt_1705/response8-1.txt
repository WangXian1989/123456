Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Prioritize employer-sponsored plans like a 401(k), especially if there’s a match.
   - Contribute to an IRA, either traditional or Roth, based on your eligibility.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for long-term investments that can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Place investments that might generate high dividends or interest in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income.

3. **Balance Your Portfolio**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance.
   - Reassess your asset allocation periodically to maintain desired risk levels.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when you’ll withdraw funds. Generally, it might be advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement, delaying tax on tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in easily accessible cash or a savings account separate from these investment accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial professional can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.
