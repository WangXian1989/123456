Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Debt Payoff**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before investing more in retirement accounts.

3. **Fund an IRA**: Once you’ve secured the employer match, contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth) based on your tax situation. A Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free growth.

4. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After funding your IRA, return to your 401(k) and continue contributing, especially if you can contribute beyond the employer match.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: If you still have funds to invest after maxing out your retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts. These offer flexibility for withdrawals but may come with capital gains taxes.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that each account is properly allocated based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Typically, growth-oriented investments may be more suitable for long-term accounts.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations as needed to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

Always consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
