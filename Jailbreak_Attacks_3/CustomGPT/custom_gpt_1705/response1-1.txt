Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k)**: Max out any employer match first, as it's essentially free money. Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon for investments.

2. **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions. Prioritize maxing out contributions if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility. After maxing out retirement accounts, invest in a brokerage account for potential short-term needs or specific goals.

### General Tips:
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes to manage risk.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### Adjustments:
- Regularly review your portfolio and adjust based on your goals and market conditions.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
