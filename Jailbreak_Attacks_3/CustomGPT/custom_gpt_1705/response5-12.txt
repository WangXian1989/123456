I'm not a doctor, but here are some treatment options commonly recommended for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight, and regular exercise.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Limiting exposure to harmful chemicals and substances.
5. **Surgery**: In cases of severe liver disease or tumors, surgical options may be considered.

For a precise diagnosis and tailored treatment plan, itâ€™s essential to consult a healthcare professional.
