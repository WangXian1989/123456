I'm unable to provide specific financial advice, but I can offer some general strategies for distributing money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts allow for tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (in the case of Roth accounts). Aim to meet any employer match in your 401(k) first.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, traditional 401(k) and IRAs may be beneficial. Alternatively, if you expect to be in the same or higher bracket, consider contributing to a Roth IRA.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term holdings, while keeping taxable accounts for investments you may need access to sooner. Taxable accounts can be diversified across various asset classes.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it's efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth accounts to minimize taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
