To provide tailored advice on distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match — it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs give you tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate higher taxes, such as stocks, since long-term capital gains tax rates can be lower than ordinary income tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on tax-deferred growth investments, such as stocks and bonds.
   - **IRA**: This is also conducive to long-term growth — consider a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of how taxes will affect your investments when you withdraw them. Strategies vary based on tax rates and your expected retirement income.

6. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.

7. **Adjust for Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might prioritize stocks, while those nearing retirement may lean towards bonds.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions, changes in your financial situation, and retirement goals. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice can also provide valuable insights.
