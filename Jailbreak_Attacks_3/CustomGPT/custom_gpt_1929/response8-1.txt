To best distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute up to the maximum limit if you can, especially if you have a matching contribution.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax situation. If eligible, aim to max out contributions to benefit from tax advantages.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and IRA contributions** reduce your taxable income (for Traditional accounts), while withdrawals are taxed at your ordinary income rate.
   - **Roth IRA contributions** are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely:** 
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is beneficial for more flexible withdrawal options and for investing in assets such as stocks that have favorable capital gains treatment.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments within each account type according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Typically, riskier investments like stocks are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to their potential for growth.

6. **Review and Adjust:** Periodically review your investment strategy and make adjustments based on performance, changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice that considers your specific financial situation and goals.
