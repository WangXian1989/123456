(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Generally, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match before allocating more to your IRA or taxable accounts.

2. **Tax Advantages**: Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first, as they allow your investments to grow tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of Roth accounts).

3. **Asset Allocation**: Consider using your 401(k) for higher-risk investments if you have a long time horizon since these accounts are sheltered from taxes until withdrawal. For your IRA, balance between growth and safety depending on your age and risk tolerance.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investment income that you want to use in the short term, as taxes are due annually on any gains.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific circumstances.
