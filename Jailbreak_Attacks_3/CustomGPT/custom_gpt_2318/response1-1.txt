When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income and defers taxes until withdrawal. If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A Traditional IRA allows for tax deductions on contributions, while Roth contributions are made with after-tax dollars but offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t have tax advantages but offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals. Consider using these for investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or stocks that you plan to hold long-term.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term versus long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term goals since they are more accessible without penalties. For retirement, focus on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and allocate assets accordingly across all accounts. If you prefer higher-risk investments, consider placing them in tax-advantaged accounts to shelter gains from taxes.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Once you reach those limits, or if you want to invest more, consider allocating excess funds to your taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to mitigate risks. A mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets can help achieve a balanced portfolio.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you’re uncertain about the right allocation strategy for your unique financial situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and the specifics of your financial situation.
