When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best approach often depends on several personal factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute enough to take full advantage of this match before considering other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions to these accounts may lower your taxable income in the year you make them, as they are typically pre-tax. Withdrawals, however, will be taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when realized. However, they provide flexibility since you can withdraw money at any time without penalties.

3. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After maximizing any employer match in your 401(k), consider putting money into a Roth IRA if you qualify. If you’ve maxed out your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to its limit.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you expect to need some of your investments before retirement age, use a taxable account for those funds. They can provide withdrawal flexibility and no early withdrawal penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment allocation is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all types of accounts to balance risk and growth potential.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and market conditions can change, so it’s important to review and adjust your distributions regularly to ensure they align with your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, particularly if you have a complex financial situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will reflect your unique financial goals, current financial situation, and future plans.
