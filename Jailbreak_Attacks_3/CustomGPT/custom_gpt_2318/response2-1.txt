The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money and should be considered first.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this can be a good strategy.
   - **IRA**: If you choose a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider your current and future tax rates when deciding which to contribute to.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These funds offer more flexibility but may be subject to capital gains tax once you sell investments at a profit.

4. **Investment Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance and investment goals, you might want to allocate more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (where taxes are deferred) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts (to manage tax implications of capital gains).

5. **Rebalancing and Withdrawals**: Remember to periodically rebalance your portfolio according to your financial goals. Also, consider the order of withdrawals in retirementâ€”they often should come from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and then tax-free accounts last.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of taxes and investment strategies, it can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that suits your individual circumstances.

In summary, start by contributing enough to the 401(k) to get the match, then evaluate whether a Traditional or Roth IRA suits you better, and finally, use taxable accounts for additional savings. Each stage should consider your long-term financial goals and possible tax implications.
