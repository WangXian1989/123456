Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to help you consider the best approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional) or made with after-tax dollars (Roth), leading to tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments can be sold at capital gains tax rates when you withdraw funds, which may be lower than ordinary income tax rates.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account or easily accessible account to cover unexpected expenses before heavily funding retirement accounts.

4. **Retirement Goals**: Assess your retirement goals and the age at which you plan to retire. This can influence how much you should save in tax-deferred accounts versus taxable accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Make sure to diversify your investments within each account type. This can help manage risk and potentially improve returns.

6. **Periodic Reassessment**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal financial situations.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances.

In summary, a balanced strategy might involve maximizing contributions to your 401(k) for any match, contributing to an IRA (considering tax implications), and using taxable accounts for additional savings and investment flexibility.
