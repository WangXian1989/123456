Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution:** Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full employer match (if available). This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Roth IRA (if eligible)**
   - **Tax-Free Growth:** Contributing to a Roth IRA can be beneficial because withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider maxing out your contributions to this account if you're eligible.

### 3. **Traditional IRA Contributions**
   - **Tax Deduction:** If you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions.

### 4. **Continue Funding Your 401(k)**
   - If you haven’t reached the contribution limit after hitting the employer match, continue contributing to your 401(k) as it has higher annual contribution limits compared to an IRA.

### 5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Emergency Funds and Short-Term Goals:** Utilize taxable accounts for any money you might need before retirement age or for shorter-term goals. This allows for more flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

### 6. **Consider Investment Choices**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, a mix of stocks and bonds is advisable, adjusting as you approach retirement.

### 7. **Tax-Efficient Investing**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Hold bonds and other income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding equities in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 8. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Adjust your contributions and investment strategies annually based on life changes, income fluctuations, and tax law changes.

### Summary:
- **Immediate Priority:** Get the full 401(k) match.
- **Next Steps:** Max out Roth IRA if eligible, then contribute to a Traditional IRA.
- **Further Contributions:** Continue adding to your 401(k).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for greater flexibility and short-term needs.
