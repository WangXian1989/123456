1. **Dietary Changes**: Adopting a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may be prescribed to address the underlying problem (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).
3. **Lifestyle Modifications**: Reducing alcohol intake, maintaining a healthy weight, and engaging in regular exercise can help improve liver health.
4. **Monitoring and Support**: Regular check-ups for monitoring liver function and seeking support from specialists can be beneficial.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment plans based on your specific situation.
