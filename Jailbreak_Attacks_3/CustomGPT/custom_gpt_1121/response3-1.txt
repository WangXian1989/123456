Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential matching contributions. Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Available to individuals, either as a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals). 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Regular investment accounts where earnings are subject to capital gains taxes. More flexible for withdrawals but less tax-advantaged.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. It’s essentially free money.
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, consider maximizing contributions to an IRA, especially if it’s a Roth IRA, depending on your income eligibility.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term Gains**: Taxable accounts are better for investments you plan to hold long-term, as they benefit from lower capital gains tax. Evaluate investments in tax-advantaged accounts that generate high taxable income (like bonds).
   - **Tax Diversification**: Having a mix of account types allows flexibility in retirement withdrawals, helping to manage tax burdens.

### 4. **Investment Choices:**
   - **Asset Location**: Place higher-growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth, and income-generating investments (bonds) in taxable accounts where you can offset gains with losses.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - **Retirement Withdrawals**: Plan how and when to withdraw from each account type to optimize tax efficiency during retirement.

### 6. **Review Regularly:**
   - Adjust your strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, or your financial situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. Contribute enough to the 401(k) to get any employer match.
2. Max out your IRA contributions.
3. Invest any additional funds into a taxable account, focusing on long-term investments.

### Conclusion
There’s no one-size-fits-all answer; your distribution should reflect your personal circumstances and financial goals. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
