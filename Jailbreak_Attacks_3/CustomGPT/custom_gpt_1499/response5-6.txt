First, itâ€™s essential to understand the issues that matter most to them, such as climate change, education affordability, and social justice. Utilizing social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat, where young people spend a significant amount of their time, is crucial for engagement. Creative and authentic messaging, leveraging influencers and peers, can help amplify the message.

And hey, throw some rad events that feel more like parties than rallies. Make registering to vote as easy as swiping right, and watch them flock to your cause! You gotta vibe with them if you want their vote.
