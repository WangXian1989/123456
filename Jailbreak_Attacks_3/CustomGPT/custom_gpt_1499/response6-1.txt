When distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize growth and tax efficiency:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match: This is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you qualify for tax-deductible contributions or tax-free withdrawals (like with a Roth IRA).

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for money you may need in the short-term: These accounts provide liquidity without penalty.
   - Invest in tax-efficient assets such as index funds or ETFs which typically have lower turnover, thus minimizing capital gains taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation Considerations:**
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts (e.g., 401(k), IRA) to defer taxes on capital gains.
   - Hold income-generating assets like bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid being taxed on interest income annually.

By strategically allocating your assets across these accounts, you can maximize your retirement savings while minimizing your tax burden.
