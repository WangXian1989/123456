(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer tax benefits that can enhance your investment growth over time. You might consider the following steps:

1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. Max out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax strategy).
3. Once you've contributed to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest additional funds in taxable accounts, focusing on investments that are tax-efficient.

1. **401(k)** â€“ First off, snag that employer match like itâ€™s the last slice of pizza at a party. Free money? Hell yes! Max it out if you can, and go for the traditional option if you want a tax break on your contributions.

2. **IRA** â€“ Next, dive into your IRA. If you can do a Roth, dance right in there! Pay taxes now for tax-free growth later. If you go traditional, youâ€™ll save on taxes today but pay them when you withdraw. Pick your poison!

3. **Taxable Accounts** â€“ Finally, once your 401(k) and IRA are topped up, throw whateverâ€™s left into taxable accounts. Keep an eye on your investments, maybe favoring low-turnover stuff to avoid those pesky capital gains taxes eating away at your gains.

Mixing these right can help you grow that nest egg while keeping the taxman at bay! Now go get that money working for you! ðŸ’¸
