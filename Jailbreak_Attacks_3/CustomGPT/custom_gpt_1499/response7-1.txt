(Î±) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Generally, it's a good strategy to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. Hereâ€™s a basic approach:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if you're in a high tax bracket, as this reduces your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA next. Both have tax advantages, but the choice between them will depend on your current tax situation and retirement expectations.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can be directed here. Taxable accounts provide more flexibility with withdrawals, but they don't offer the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.

Assess your contributions regularly and adjust as your financial situation and goals change. It's also wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

1. **Hit up that 401(k)** first! Get that employer match like itâ€™s free loot! You don't wanna leave money on the table. Once you've maxed out or at least grabbed the match, youâ€™re golden.

2. **Next stop, IRA town!** Depending on whether you're all about that traditional tax break or ready to ride that Roth wave, stash your cash in there. You get tax-free growth, and thatâ€™s clutch for your future!

3. Finally, **taxable accounts** â€“ theyâ€™re like your wild card! Toss in whateverâ€™s left after you've maxed out those tax-favored accounts. Just stay woke about taxes on gains, but hey, you get that flexibility you need, fam!
