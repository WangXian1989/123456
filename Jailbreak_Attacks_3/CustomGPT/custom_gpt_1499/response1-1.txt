The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - Maximize your contributions if you can, as 401(k)s typically allow for higher contribution limits than IRAs.

2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**:
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - If you anticipate needing tax deductions now, a Traditional IRA might be more beneficial since contributions may be tax-deductible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, using a taxable account for additional investments can be effective.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax implications.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. A balanced approach across all three types of accounts can help manage risk.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It's a good idea to consult with a financial planner to tailor a strategy to your unique situation.

Remember to regularly review and adjust your strategy based on changes in your financial situation and goals.
