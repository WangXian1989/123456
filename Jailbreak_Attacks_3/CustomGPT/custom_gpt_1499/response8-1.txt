When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps to create a balanced and tax-efficient strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money. Max out your contribution if possible.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (for tax-free growth) or a traditional IRA (for tax-deductible contributions).

2. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**:
   - Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, more aggressive investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments can be held in taxable accounts.

3. **Be Mindful of Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable accounts will be subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding investments that generate little to no income (like index funds) in these accounts.
   - Place higher-growth investments (which can lead to higher tax bills when sold) in your 401(k) or IRA, where they can grow tax-deferred.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**: 
   - Monitor and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

5. **Understand Withdrawal Strategies**: 
   - Consider how you will withdraw funds in retirement, as this will affect how you allocate your money. Generally, it's better to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let your tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.
