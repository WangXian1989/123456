Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and should be prioritized.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are usually made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxable withdrawals) or a Roth IRA (taxable contributions, tax-free withdrawals), the tax implications will differ.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold. These can be a good option for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

3. **Investment Goals and Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), lean more towards tax-advantaged accounts like the 401(k) and IRA, as they offer growth potential with tax benefits.
   - For shorter-term goals, consider allocating more to taxable accounts for easier access.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts to spread risk. Maintain a balance of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your asset allocation among your accounts to ensure alignment with your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation and goals.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will align with your overall financial picture and goals.
