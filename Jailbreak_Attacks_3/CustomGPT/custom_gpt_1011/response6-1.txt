To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Account Types and Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed at your income rate in retirement.
   - **IRA:** Similar to 401(k) with traditional IRAs; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invested after-tax money; capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year theyâ€™re realized.

### 2. **Consider Your Financial Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Maximize contributions to retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) first.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Maintain liquidity in taxable accounts for near-term expenses or investments.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be mindful of yearly contribution limits:
     - **401(k):** $22,500 (2023) + $7,500 if you're over 50.
     - **IRA:** $6,500 (2023) + $1,000 if you're over 50.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Higher-risk investments (stocks) can be held in tax-deferred accounts, while stable investments (bonds, cash) might be better in taxable accounts to minimize tax exposure.
   - **Rebalance Periodically:** Adjust investments based on market performance and changing financial goals.

### 5. **Tax Considerations for Withdrawals**
   - Plan to withdraw from tax-deferred accounts in lower-income years to minimize tax liabilities.
   - Understand the order of withdrawals: typically, use taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged growth to continue in retirement accounts.

By balancing contributions based on these factors, you can maximize growth while minimizing tax liabilities over the long term. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
