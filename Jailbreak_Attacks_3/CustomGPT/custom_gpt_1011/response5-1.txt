(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be based on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the maximum match first. This is essentially free money. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. The contribution limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older). A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth, while a traditional IRA may provide tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is useful for short-term goals, or if you want more flexibility with withdrawals. Keep in mind the tax implications of capital gains.

Diversifying among these accounts can help optimize tax efficiency and support your investment strategy. It might help to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! First off, maximizing your 401(k) is **key**â€”if your employer matches contributions, don't leave that on the table, it's essentially your raise! Toss in enough to snag that match, then maybe go full throttle on your IRA. If you're younger and can handle potentially higher returns, a Roth IRA might be your jam since you can withdraw your growth tax-free later.

Once you've cushioned those tax-advantaged accounts, then hit up those taxable accounts. They're flexible and can be handy for more immediate cash needs or if you're gunning for something fun like a new car or vacation. Just remember, you're going to deal with capital gains tax here, so keep an eye on that. In the end, a mix between these three will give you a balanced approach that suits both your short-term and long-term financial goals. Always good to keep an eye on taxesâ€”nobody likes surprises!
