When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you'll want to take several factors into account, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money and a great starting point.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, this can be beneficial.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may also be tax-deductible, potentially lowering your current tax bill.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth contributions.

3. **Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment options available in your 401(k) and the fees associated with them. Sometimes, an IRA offers more flexibility and a wider array of investment choices.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified, including various types of assets across all accounts. This helps manage risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a sufficient cash reserve in a taxable account for emergencies. This can help prevent you from having to withdraw from your retirement accounts prematurely.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on market conditions and your changing financial goals.

8. **Seek Professional Advice**: If you have complex financial circumstances, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific needs.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
