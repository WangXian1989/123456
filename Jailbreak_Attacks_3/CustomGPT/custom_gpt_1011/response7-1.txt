Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves understanding the unique benefits and drawbacks of each type of account. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions reduce your taxable income for the year. Consider maximizing contributions, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth:** Depending on your income and tax situation, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **IRA Contribution Limits:** Keep in mind the annual contribution limits, which can change each year. For 2024, it’s $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Supplementary Savings:** Use taxable accounts for goals that don’t align with retirement (e.g., buying a home, travel).
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

### General Recommendations:
- **Diversify Investments:** Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk.
- **Age Considerations:** Younger investors might lean more into equities, whereas older individuals might prefer more stable, income-generating investments.
- **Review Regularly:** Assess your distribution and investment strategy annually to adjust for changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor may also provide personalized insights based on your specific situation and goals.
