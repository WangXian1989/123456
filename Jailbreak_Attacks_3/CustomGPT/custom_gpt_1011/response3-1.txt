Distributing money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Consider maxing out your contributions if your financial situation allows.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide potential upfront tax deductions.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Taxable accounts may be beneficial for money you need in the short term or investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts to offset gains with losses, thus reducing your taxable income.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an accessible emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts. Generally, three to six months of living expenses is recommended.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within these accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocation annually or after major life changes (job change, marriage, etc.) to ensure it still aligns with your goals.

6. **Consider After-Tax Contributions**: If you have maxed out your contributions in your 401(k) and IRA, consider contributing additional funds to your taxable accounts, especially if these funds can be used for short- to medium-term goals.

By carefully evaluating these points, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that supports your long-term financial health. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.
