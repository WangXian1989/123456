Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After obtaining the match, consider maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first:
   - **401(k)**: If you have an employer plan, it often has higher contribution limits and potential tax advantages.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, you might qualify for a tax deduction on contributions. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Contributions to 401(k) and traditional IRA reduce your taxable income now, while withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth IRA contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts do not provide immediate tax benefits, but they offer more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Consider more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on market conditions, changes in income, or shifts in retirement goals.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor for a personalized plan based on your specific financial situation and goals.
