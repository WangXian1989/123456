To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider maxing out your IRA (Roth or Traditional, based on your tax situation).

2. **Investment Choices**: Use your 401(k) for employer-sponsored investment options and potentially higher equity exposure. IRAs often offer more diverse investment choices, so consider using them for investments you believe will appreciate over time. 

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like your 401(k) and Traditional IRA), and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs), to minimize taxes over time.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure good asset allocation across all accounts. Holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts can be a wise move, while you might want to keep more tax-efficient investments, like stocks, in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your target allocation. Different account types might grow at different rates, affecting your overall strategy.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: Align investments with your long-term goals and risk tolerance. Younger individuals might prefer growth-oriented investments, while those closer to retirement might prioritize stability.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation and goals.
