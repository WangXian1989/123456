Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a high-yield savings account before aggressively investing.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max out IRA**: Contribute to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) next, as it provides tax advantages.
   - **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, return to your 401(k) to reach the maximum allowable contribution.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments beyond your tax-advantaged accounts. These are good for flexibility and can house investments that may generate lower tax liabilities (e.g., long-term capital gains, qualified dividends).

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and goals. Generally, stocks are recommended for long-term growth while bonds can provide stability.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Your goals and financial landscape may change, so periodically review and adjust your allocations as necessary.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for a personalized plan that aligns with your specific situation.
