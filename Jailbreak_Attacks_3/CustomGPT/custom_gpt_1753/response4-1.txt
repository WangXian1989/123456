To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions next, especially if your IRA offers tax-deferred growth or Roth benefits.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider using Roth accounts, which provide tax-free withdrawals.
   - Conversely, if you're in a lower tax bracket now and expect to be in a higher one later, traditional accounts (like a 401(k) and traditional IRA) can be advantageous since contributions are tax-deductible.

3. **Balance for Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep a sufficient amount in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies, as these funds are easily accessible without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts, adjusting for tax implications. For example, place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on the gains.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure about the best course of action, seek personalized advice from a financial professional who can help tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.

By strategically using each type of account based on its respective tax implications and your financial goals, you can optimize your overall investment and retirement strategy effectively.
