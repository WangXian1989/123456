Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively is crucial for maximizing growth and minimizing taxes. Here are some strategies you can consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plans with potential matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income now.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages, either traditional (pre-tax contributions) or Roth (post-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Account**: Funds here are subject to capital gains tax, but offer flexibility and no contribution limits.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your **401(k)** to get the full employer match. This is essentially “free money” and should be a priority.

### 3. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - Make maximum contributions to your **IRA** if eligible (consider both Traditional and Roth options based on your tax situation).
   - Consider the **401(k)** for any additional contributions after reaching IRA limits.

### 4. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you’re likely to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a **Roth IRA** may be more beneficial due to tax-free withdrawals.
   - If you anticipate a lower bracket, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) can reduce your current tax liability.

### 5. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all account types, but consider holding more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Prioritize Liquid Assets in Taxable Accounts**
   - Keep money for short-term needs in your **taxable accounts**. This gives you access without penalties or taxes on early withdrawals.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Keep an eye on your allocations and rebalance as needed to ensure you’re meeting your financial goals and risk tolerance across all accounts.

### 8. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - Develop a strategy for withdrawals, considering tax implications based on your retirement income needs and where to draw funds from first.

### Conclusion
Distributing your money wisely among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can lead to better growth and lower taxes in retirement. Always consider your individual financial situation and consult a financial advisor for tailored advice.
