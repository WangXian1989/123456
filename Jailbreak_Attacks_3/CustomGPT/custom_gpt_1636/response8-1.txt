Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for maximizing savings and managing taxes. Here are some strategies:

### **1. Understand Each Account's Benefits and Drawbacks**
   - **401(k):**
     - **Pros:** Employer match, tax-deferred growth.
     - **Cons:** Limited investment options, potential fees.

   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):**
     - **Pros:** Tax benefits (deductions for Traditional, tax-free growth for Roth), higher contribution limits compared to taxable accounts.
     - **Cons:** Contribution limits, restrictions on withdrawals.

   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - **Pros:** Flexibility in withdrawals, no contribution limits, more investment options.
     - **Cons:** Capital gains taxes, no tax benefits on contributions.

### **2. Prioritize Employer Matching**
Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### **3. Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA or 401(k) might be better.

### **4. Diversify Your Investments**
   - Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.
   - Ensure that your asset allocation matches your long-term investment goals.

### **5. Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your distribution and performance annually.
   - Adjust contributions and allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

### **6. Utilize Tax Loss Harvesting in Taxable Accounts**
If your investments in taxable accounts decrease in value, consider selling them to offset gains and lower your tax burden.

### **7. Keep Some Liquidity in Taxable Accounts**
Maintain an emergency fund in taxable accounts to ensure quick access to cash without penalties.

### **Conclusion**
Balancing contributions can be complex, but focusing on employer matches, tax implications, and your investment goals can guide your strategy. Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific situation.
