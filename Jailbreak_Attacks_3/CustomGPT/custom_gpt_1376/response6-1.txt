Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA since they offer tax deferral or tax-free growth.
- **Consider Roth Options:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or use a Roth 401(k) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Contribution Limits
- **401(k):** Maximize contributions up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if youâ€™re 50 or older).
- **IRA:** Contribute to your IRA (up to $6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if 50+). Ensure you meet income eligibility for tax-deductible contributions.

### 3. Investment Goals
- **Risk Tolerance:** Allocate higher-risk investments in taxable accounts for potential capital gains treatment, while using tax-deferred accounts for more stable investments.
- **Time Horizon:** Longer time frames can favor riskier assets, while shorter ones should focus on stability.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** Max out contributions to benefit from employer matches.
- **IRA:** Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for flexibility.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for short-term goals and invest in low-turnover funds to minimize taxes.

### Summary
- Leverage tax advantages first.
- Adjust asset allocation based on your goals and timeline.
- Monitor and rebalance regularly to align with changing financial circumstances.
