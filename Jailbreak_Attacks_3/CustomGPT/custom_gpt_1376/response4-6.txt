4. **Interactive Campaigns**: Use interactive elements like polls, quizzes, and challenges to engage young voters and stimulate discussions.

5. **Grassroots Efforts**: Organize events, volunteer opportunities, or community service projects. Young voters connect with candidates who actively engage in their communities.
