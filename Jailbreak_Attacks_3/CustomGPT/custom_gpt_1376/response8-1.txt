Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your tax situation, consider maxing out your IRA (Roth or Traditional). If you're eligible for a Roth, it might offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: Once you’ve maxed out the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility, particularly for goals that might arise before retirement, such as buying a home.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts; holding investments long-term can help minimize tax liabilities. 

6. **Investment Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts, balancing risk and return based on your age and risk tolerance.

7. **Review Annually**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
