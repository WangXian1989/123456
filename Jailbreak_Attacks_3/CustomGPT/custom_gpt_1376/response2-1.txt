Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Max out your 401(k)** up to the annual limit once you receive the employer match.
   - After that, consider fully funding your IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for savings goals that are shorter-term (like a house down payment) or for investments not suited for retirement accounts (like certain real estate investments).
   - These accounts can house investments with favorable tax treatment (like qualified dividends and long-term capital gains).

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk.
   - Consider the tax implications of your investments; place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts and bond funds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investment allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - If necessary, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

This balanced approach can help optimize your investment growth while managing taxes efficiently.
