Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: These accounts can offer tax benefits. If you expect your income to increase, a Roth IRA may be preferable since you pay taxes now and withdraw tax-free later.
   - **401(k)**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the contribution limit if you havenâ€™t done so.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**: Taxable accounts are useful for short-term goals and can provide flexibility without withdrawal penalties, but they usually have less favorable tax treatment compared to tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are properly diversified within each account. Generally, you might want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in accounts that have tax advantages and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact on income.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust based on performance, life changes, and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized guidance based on your unique financial situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
