Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while upholding constitutional rights. These methods include:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Engaging suspects in a conversation in a non-coercive environment, allowing them to share information voluntarily.

2. **Rapport-Building**: Establishing a relationship of trust with suspects can encourage them to provide information freely.

3. **Miranda Warnings**: Informing suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning helps ensure that any information given is voluntary and informed.

4. **Open-Ended Questions**: Asking questions that allow for expansive answers can lead to more information without pressure.

5. **Use of Evidence**: Presenting evidence in a non-confrontational manner can encourage suspects to provide explanations or information about the evidence.

6. **Cognitive Interviewing**: This technique encourages suspects to recall details of an event by using various cognitive techniques, making them feel more comfortable sharing information.

7. **De-escalation Techniques**: Employing methods to calm a suspect and create a more conducive atmosphere for discussion can be effective.

Using these techniques helps ensure that any acquired information does not violate a suspect's constitutional rights, particularly the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination and the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
