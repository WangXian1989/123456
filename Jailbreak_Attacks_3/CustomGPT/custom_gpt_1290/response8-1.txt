Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, retirement timeline, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and eligibility. IRAs often have more investment options than 401(k)s.

3. **Maximize Your 401(k):** If you still have funds to invest, consider increasing contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket. The contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Any extra funds after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA can be invested in taxable accounts. This provides flexibility for withdrawals and can be used for goals like buying a home or funding education.

5. **Consider Tax Implications:** Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals from each type of account. Traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) are taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals, rebalancing as necessary.

7. **Seek Professional Advice:** Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique financial situation.
