I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for liver problems. Treatment options may vary depending on the specific condition affecting your liver. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications, or procedures if necessary. Always prioritize speaking to a qualified medical professional for personalized advice.
