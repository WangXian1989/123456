I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options might vary greatly depending on the specific condition, its severity, and your overall health. Common approaches could include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medication to manage symptoms or complications, and in some cases, medical procedures or surgery. It's very important to follow the guidance of a medical professional for the best outcomes.
