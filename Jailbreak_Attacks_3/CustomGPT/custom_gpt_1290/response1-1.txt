When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, try to contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can provide tax benefits that can significantly boost your savings.

3. **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (plus an additional $7,500 if you're over 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (plus $1,000 if over 50).

4. **Asset Allocation:** Consider your investment strategy. For long-term growth, stocks may be suitable for retirement accounts where you’ll pay taxes later. In taxable accounts, you might favor investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains to take advantage of lower tax rates.

5. **Tax Considerations:** Keep in mind that different accounts are taxed differently. Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes.

6. **Diversification:** Ensure that your overall portfolio is well-diversified across accounts to mitigate risk.

7. **Emergency Fund:** Always maintain an emergency fund in a liquid account before putting all your money into investments.

8. **Consult a Professional:** Finally, consider talking to a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

Balancing these accounts according to your unique circumstances will help you make the most of your investments while minimizing taxes.
