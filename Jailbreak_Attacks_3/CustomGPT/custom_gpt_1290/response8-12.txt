I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that if you're experiencing liver problems, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Common options for liver issues can include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications to manage symptoms or underlying causes, and in some cases, more advanced treatments such as procedures or surgeries. Always seek personalized medical advice for your specific condition.
