Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a strategic approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” and should be prioritized.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred. This means they lower your taxable income now, and you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. Consider keeping investments that you plan to hold long-term in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Higher risk, higher growth investments (like stocks) might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) since they can appreciate without immediate tax consequences.
   - Consider more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts since they generate interest that is taxed at your ordinary income rate.

4. **Retirement Goals**: 
   - If you foresee needing funds before retirement, prioritize your taxable accounts for liquidity, as 401(k) and IRA distributions before 59½ may incur penalties.
   - For long-term growth, focus more on maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type to optimize your investments fully.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

Ultimately, it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation.
