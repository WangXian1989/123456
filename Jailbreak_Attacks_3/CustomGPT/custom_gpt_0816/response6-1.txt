Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a balanced approach based on various factors such as your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Taxation**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, providing tax-deferred growth, but withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA:** Depending on whether itâ€™s a traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible (traditional) or tax-free upon withdrawal (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment gains and dividends are subject to capital gains taxes, which can be higher than ordinary income rates for short-term gains.

### 2. **Investment Objectives**
   - **401(k):** Generally suitable for long-term growth, especially if your employer offers a match. Aim for a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), but often offers more investment options, particularly with a self-directed account. Adjust your allocation based on tax strategies.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that may require liquidity or for tax-efficient investments to minimize tax impact (like index funds or tax-managed funds).

### 3. **Allocation Strategy**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have a liquid cash reserve before locking away funds in retirement accounts.
   - **Proportional Distribution:**
     - **Maximize 401(k) contributions** to take advantage of employer matches.
     - **Consider funding an IRA** (preferably a Roth if eligible).
     - **Distribute any remaining funds** into taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 4. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Example:
- **401(k):** 50% of contributions.
- **IRA:** 30% of contributions.
- **Taxable Account:** 20% of contributions.

This strategy leverages tax advantages while maintaining flexibility and enabling access to funds as needed. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
