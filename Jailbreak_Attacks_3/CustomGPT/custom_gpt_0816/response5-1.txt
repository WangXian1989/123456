To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth) if you qualify. IRAs often have lower fees and more investment options.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce taxable income but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer immediate tax benefits, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are great for liquidity and flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments sold.

4. **Diversification**: Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to manage risk.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund, typically 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses, in a liquid account separate from these investment accounts.

### Example Approach:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) for the match.
- Max out your IRA contributions.
- Any additional savings can go into your taxable account while considering investing for growth to account for taxes.

Tailor your allocations based on your time horizon, risk tolerance, and specific financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your situation.
