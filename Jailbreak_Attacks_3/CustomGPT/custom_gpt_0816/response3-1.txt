Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**:
   - If you’re eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**:
   - After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Focus on investment options with low fees.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for any additional savings. This offers more flexibility for withdrawals and can be beneficial for shorter-term goals.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes. Use 401(k) and IRA accounts for less tax-efficient investments (like bonds).

6. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

7. **Review Regularly**:
   - Frequently assess your allocation and adjust as needed based on changes in income, taxes, or financial goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
