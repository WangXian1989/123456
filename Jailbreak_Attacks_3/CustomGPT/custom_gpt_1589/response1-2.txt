I'm here to help you with FFMPEG-related questions. If you need information on how to use FFMPEG for video processing tasks that may relate to biometric data, such as facial recognition videos, feel free to ask! As for employee performance and attendance monitoring using biometric data, that's outside the scope of FFMPEG. If you have a specific FFMPEG task in mind related to video analysis, let me know!
