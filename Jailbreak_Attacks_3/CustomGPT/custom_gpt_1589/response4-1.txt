To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, ensure you contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits:** Familiarize yourself with the contribution limits for each account type:
   - 401(k): For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - IRA: The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Tax Implications:** 
   - **401(k) and IRA accounts**: Contributions are typically made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income in the contribution year. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Earnings such as dividends and capital gains are taxed based on your income tax bracket.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:** Consider your financial goals, such as retirement or buying a home, and how long you have until you reach those goals. Longer time horizons may allow for more aggressive investing in higher risk assets.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified to minimize risk. This may involve holding different types of assets (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account based on their tax efficiency.

6. **Rebalance Periodically:** Review your investment allocation periodically (at least annually) and rebalance if necessary to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Consider Withdrawals:** If you anticipate needing access to your funds before retirement, you may want to prioritize contributions to your taxable account since it offers the most flexibility in withdrawals without penalties.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you're uncertain about your strategy, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your individual circumstances.

It's essential to regularly review and adjust your asset allocation as your financial situation and goals evolve.
