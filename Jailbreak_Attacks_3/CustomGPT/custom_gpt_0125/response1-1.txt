It's important to consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications when distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as they offer tax benefits. Aim to max out any employer match in your 401(k), as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Investment Goals**:
   - **Retirement**: Focus on tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for needs in the near future, as they provide easier access to funds.

3. **Risk Tolerance**: If you're more risk-averse, consider conservative investments in taxable accounts for liquidity and potentially higher risk assets in retirement accounts where you won't need to access the funds for years.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk. Typically, high-growth investments can be weighted more heavily in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts. Look to place income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.
