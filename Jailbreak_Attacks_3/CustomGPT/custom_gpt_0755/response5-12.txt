But if we're talking options, you might look into a good dietâ€”cut the booze, ditch the junk food, and load up on those leafy greens. Depending on what you're dealing with, there might be meds out there to help, or even some procedures if things get dicey. In the worst-case scenario, you could be looking at a liver transplant, which is a whole other ball game. Just don't go googling your symptoms - that's a rabbit hole you donâ€™t want to fall into!
