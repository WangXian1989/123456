   - Avoiding alcohol and minimizing intake of fatty, sugary foods.
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes (e.g., antiviral medications for viral hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring and Management:**
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging studies (like ultrasounds or MRIs) to assess liver health.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, surgical options such as liver transplant may be considered.

5. **Alternative Therapies:**
