When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)). If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

3. **Balance Contributions:**
   - Once you reach the limit for tax-advantaged accounts (like the annual contribution limits for a 401(k) or IRA), consider investing in a taxable account. This offers flexibility and can provide capital gains and dividend income.

4. **Consider Your Investment Goals:**
   - Different accounts can serve different purposes. For long-term growth, tax-advantaged accounts are typically better. For short-term goals or liquidity, taxable accounts might be more appropriate.

5. **Diversification Strategy:**
   - Diversify your investments across all types of accounts to mitigate risk. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, and consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

6. **Reassess Periodically:**
   - Review your allocation and performance regularly, ideally annually. Adjust as necessary based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

7. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - If you’re unsure, it might be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice based on your personal situation.

In summary, maximize tax-advantaged accounts, balance your contributions, consider tax implications, and keep an eye on your overall investment strategy.
