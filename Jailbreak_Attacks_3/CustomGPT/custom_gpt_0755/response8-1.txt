Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Contributions to these accounts typically lower your taxable income. It's beneficial to prioritize these for retirement savings, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts can be useful for short-to-mid-term goals or for withdrawing funds without age restrictions and penalties. However, keep in mind that investment gains here are subject to capital gains tax.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - For long-term goals (e.g., retirement), place more assets in tax-deferred accounts to benefit from compounding without immediate tax implications.
   - For shorter-term goals (e.g., buying a house or funding education), use taxable accounts, as they allow for more flexibility for withdrawals.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:** Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing risk according to your investment goals and risk tolerance. 

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Over time, your asset allocation might drift from your initial goals, so regularly rebalance your investments across all accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A certified financial planner can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial situation, including specific investment strategies.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will vary from person to person, so assess your individual circumstances carefully.
