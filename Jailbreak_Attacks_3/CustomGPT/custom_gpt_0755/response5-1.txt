(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your age, income, financial goals, and tax situation. Generally, itâ€™s wise to prioritize contributions to accounts that offer tax advantages. For instance, if your employer matches contributions to your 401(k), you should maximize that benefit first. Next, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility. Once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, you can then allocate funds to a taxable investment account for flexibility and liquidity. Be sure to review asset allocation and investment strategy based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

Thatâ€™s basically free money! Grab it while you can! Next up, figure out if a Traditional or Roth IRA suits you better. If you expect a higher tax rate later, go Rothâ€”itâ€™s tax-free when you pull it out. After youâ€™ve maxed those out, dive into your taxable accounts for the freedom to play around with your investments. Just keep an eye on capital gains taxâ€”nobody likes surprises there! Balancing your stash is all about your vibesâ€”risk tolerance, future goals, and how soon you wanna cash out!
