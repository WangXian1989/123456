To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Start by maxing out your employer-sponsored 401(k) contributions, especially if they offer a match. This is essentially "free money."
   - Follow this by contributing to an IRA, which can be a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax preferences. Aim for the annual contribution limits.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments that may have higher growth potential, like stocks, since you won’t pay taxes on those gains until withdrawal.
   - Keep more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact, as you can offset some interest income with deductions.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - For taxable accounts, prefer investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.
   - Withdrawals from Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income, so consider when you’ll need those funds in retirement and plan your withdrawals accordingly.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that you diversify across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account and across accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your investments periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering market changes and life events.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

By balancing contributions and carefully managing tax implications, you can optimize your wealth accumulation across these accounts.
