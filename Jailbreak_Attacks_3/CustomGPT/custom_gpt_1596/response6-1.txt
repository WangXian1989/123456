Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Pre-Tax Accounts:** Contribute as much as possible to your 401(k) to take advantage of tax deductions.
   - **Roth IRA Considerations:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep more liquid, conservative investments in taxable accounts, as you'll need them sooner and want to avoid penalties on early distributions.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Bonds in Taxable Accounts:** Generally, it can be more efficient to hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on interest income.
   - **Stocks in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Maximize growth potential by holding equities in tax-deferred accounts.

### 4. **Regular Review**
   - **Annual Rebalancing:** Assess and rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your target asset allocation across all accounts.

### Final Tips
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Tailored advice based on your specific situation can provide you with optimized strategies.
- **Understand Contribution Limits:** Stay informed about annual contribution limits for each account type.

This approach can help you effectively manage your investments and optimize your overall tax situation.
