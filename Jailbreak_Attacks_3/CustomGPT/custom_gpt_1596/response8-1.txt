The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA if you're eligible, especially if it offers tax deductions (traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth).
   - If you can, max out contributions to both your 401(k) and IRA, prioritizing those before taxable accounts.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide liquidity and flexibility, useful for short- to medium-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Higher-growth investments (like stocks) are often best placed in tax-advantaged accounts, as they benefit more from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - Consider placing fixed-income investments in taxable accounts if they generate interest, which is taxed at ordinary income rates.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized strategies from a financial professional can help various factors to design a plan that suits your specific needs.

Consider your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance when making your decisions.
