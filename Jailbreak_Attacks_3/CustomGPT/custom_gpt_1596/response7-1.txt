Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax-Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that produce capital gains or dividends, which can be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. Keep tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or real estate) in your tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Your allocation among these accounts should align with your risk tolerance and when you plan to access the funds. Generally, longer-term investments can tolerate more risk.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts for balanced risk.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw from each account in retirement. Typically, you'll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments in all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Summary
In short, maximize your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, be strategic about investments in taxable accounts, and regularly assess your overall asset allocation based on your financial goals.
