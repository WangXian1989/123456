Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **IRA**: Similar to the 401(k), you can choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). Aim to max out contributions if eligible.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Good for flexibility and access to funds, but be cautious about capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

4. **Adjust Based on Time Horizon**: 
   - If you're young, you might lean more toward stocks for growth potential.
   - As you near retirement, shift to more conservative investments to preserve capital.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside these accounts to avoid needing to withdraw from them prematurely, which could incur penalties.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly assess your asset allocation and adjust your contributions based on performance and life changes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice can be beneficial, especially if your financial situation is complex.

Balancing contributions can maximize growth and minimize taxes, setting you up for a comfortable retirement.
