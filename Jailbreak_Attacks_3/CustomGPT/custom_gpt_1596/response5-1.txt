Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Aim to max out your IRA contributions if you're eligible, particularly a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

2. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: These are suitable for investments that may generate a lot of taxable income, like bonds or REITs, since you won't pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for investments that qualify for favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains) or those you might need access to before retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in a manner aligned with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Reassess Regularly**: 
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a plan specific to your situation.
