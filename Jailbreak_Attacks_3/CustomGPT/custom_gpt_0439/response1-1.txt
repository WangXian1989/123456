Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on whether you're eligible for a Traditional or Roth IRA, consider maxing out contributions. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This offers more flexibility for withdrawals but comes with capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Age and Time Horizon**: Younger investors might focus on growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement may prefer more stable investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified, balancing between stocks and bonds to match your risk tolerance.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Market conditions, life changes, and retirement goals should prompt you to reassess your distribution strategy periodically.
