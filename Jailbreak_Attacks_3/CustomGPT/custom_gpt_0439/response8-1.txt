To optimize your investment distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which is beneficial for tax deferral. However, withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax advantages as a 401(k), with tax-deferred growth. If it's a Roth IRA, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. Focus on tax-efficient investments to minimize tax liabilities.

2. **Investment Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider higher-risk investments here since they grow tax-deferred. Maximize employer matches if available.
   - **IRA**: Use for a mix of growth-oriented and income-generating investments. Take advantage of compound growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor tax-efficient investments like index funds, ETFs, and tax-exempt bonds to mitigate tax impact.

3. **Retirement Goals and Timeline**:
   - Assess your age and retirement timeline. The younger you are, the more you can allocate towards growth-focused assets in your tax-advantaged accounts.
   - As you approach retirement, gradually shift towards more conservative investments.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure assets are diversified across and within accounts to reduce risk. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and aim to max out tax-advantaged accounts first before investing in taxable accounts.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a specific plan based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
