Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Good for long-term growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar tax advantages as a 401(k). Consider if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax money. Withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but you can withdraw anytime. Capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments for a profit.

3. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Always maintain an emergency fund in a readily accessible account (like a savings account) before heavily investing.

4. **Investment Horizon:**
   - For long-term goals (retirement), focus more on tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For short-term needs (buying a house, travel), consider taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified. This prevents overexposure to one asset or investment type.

6. **Monitor Tax Implications:**
   - Be mindful of capital gains and dividends in taxable accounts. Consider holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Adjust Based on Life Changes:**
   - Reassess your distribution strategy as life circumstances change, such as a salary increase, marriage, or approaching retirement.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full match (e.g., 5-10% of your salary).
2. **IRA/Roth IRA:** Maximize contributions next (e.g., $6,500 annually or $7,500 if youâ€™re over 50).
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any leftover savings here once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out.

### Regular Review:
- Review your allocation annually or after significant financial changes to ensure it still aligns with your goals.
