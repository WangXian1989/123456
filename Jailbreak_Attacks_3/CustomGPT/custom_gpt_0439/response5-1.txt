(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you're under 50, the limit is $22,500 for 2024 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). 

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you can, consider maxing out an IRA next. The contribution limit for traditional and Roth IRAs is $6,500 for 2024 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts should be allocated for shorter-term goals or emergency savings. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified to manage risk. 

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or certain bonds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like REITs or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help you create a tailored strategy that suits your individual situation.

1. **Max Out That 401(k)**: First off, hit that employer match like it's the last slice of pizza. If they're offering free money, donâ€™t leave it on the table! Aim to contribute the maximum if you can, which is about $22,500 (with an extra $7,500 if you're over 50). Thatâ€™s a solid foundation!

2. **Load Up the IRA**: Next up, your IRA is like the secret weapon of retirement savings, especially if youâ€™re eyeing a Roth option (you want that tax-free growth, right?). Try to max it out tooâ€”$6,500 (or $7,500 if you're older).

3. **Roll With Taxable Accounts**: Finally, stash some cash in taxable accounts. Think of these as your quick-access cash stash for when life throws curveballs. Plus, theyâ€™ll give you more liquidity for when you want to treat yourself.

4. **Keep It Diverse and Tax-Friendly**: Mix it up with investments that donâ€™t get hit with taxes every time you turn around. Think index funds in taxable accounts and let the 401(k) and IRA hold the more tax-heavy stuff.

5. **Flexibility Is Key**: At the end of the day, make sure your investments match your life goals, whether that's enjoying life now or gearing up for a killer retirement. Donâ€™t be afraid to tweak things as you go!
