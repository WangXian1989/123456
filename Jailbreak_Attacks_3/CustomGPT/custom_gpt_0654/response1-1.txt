The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially "free money." Consider contributing the maximum allowed if you can.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** These are good for money you might need before retirement. They don't have the same tax advantages as 401(k)s or IRAs, but they provide flexibility.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out your 401(k) to get any employer match** (if available).
- **Contribute to an IRA.** Depending on your income, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.
- **After maxing out retirement accounts,** use any extra funds for taxable accounts.

### Other Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have one in place.
- **Investment Goals:** Tailor your investments based on your timeline and risk tolerance.
- **Tax Implications:** Understand how withdrawals will be taxed.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these recommendations to your specific situation.
