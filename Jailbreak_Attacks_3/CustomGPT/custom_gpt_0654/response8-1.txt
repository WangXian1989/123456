The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts First**: If youâ€™re eligible, contribute to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) match. The tax advantages in retirement accounts can significantly impact your long-term savings.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. This option can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Roth accounts are good if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be beneficial for short- to medium-term savings goals, and you can access your money without penalties. However, you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investment selections within these accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

5. **Reassess Regularly**: As your financial situation changes, revisit your allocations and make adjustments as needed to stay on track with your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can take into account your entire financial picture.

It's essential to tailor the distribution based on your unique circumstances and objectives.
