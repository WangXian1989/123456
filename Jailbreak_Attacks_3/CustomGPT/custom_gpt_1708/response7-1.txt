To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, if eligible. Otherwise, a traditional IRA can provide tax deductions.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts for potentially higher growth, as they often have lower tax consequences for long-term capital gains.
   - Hold bonds or other income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on interest and dividends.

3. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance, time horizon, and overall financial goals.

4. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: 
   - Monitor your accounts regularly and adjust your allocations as needed based on performance and market conditions.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial planner who can tailor strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.

This balanced approach helps maximize your investment growth while managing tax implications effectively.
