To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. The limit is $6,500 annually (or $7,500 if you're over 50) for 2023.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Allocate growth-focused investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA since gains are tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate income or short-term gains, such as bonds or real estate, which are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Investment Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to reduce risk. Consider the same or similar asset allocation in each account, tailored based on their tax implications.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolios to maintain your desired asset allocation, accounting for market fluctuations.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals considering tax implications. Generally, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts, depending on your retirement income strategy.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to customize your plan based on your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.
