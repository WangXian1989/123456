The best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the maximum match. This is effectively “free money.”
   - Max out your contributions if possible. For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 for individuals under 50, and $30,000 for those 50 and older.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If you qualify for a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, consider contributing to these accounts.
   - A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider investing in taxable accounts for added flexibility. 
   - Keep in mind that investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax on any earnings when sold.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - The type of investments you hold can affect the distribution strategy. For example, hold higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes on growth.
   - Consider bond funds and stable investments in taxable accounts, where interest income is taxed at ordinary income rates.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, you might typically withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.
   - This strategy may also help manage tax liabilities over time.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Given the complexity of tax laws and investment options, consulting with a financial planner can help tailor a strategy based on your specific situation.

Regularly review and adjust your strategy as your financial situation and tax laws change. Always aim for a diversified investment portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals.
