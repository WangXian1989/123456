The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Also tax-deductible, but similar to a 401(k), you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell. Consider holding tax-efficient investments here (like index funds).

3. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Allocate between different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for investments that might generate high taxes (like bonds or REITs), while keeping tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older)
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older)

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review your portfolio distribution and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before tying up funds in retirement accounts.

7. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.

By optimizing contributions across these accounts, you can make the most of tax advantages and grow your wealth effectively over time.
