It's important to consult a healthcare professional for advice specific to your liver problem. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the type and severity of the liver condition. Generally, some treatment approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, losing weight, and exercising regularly can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g. antivirals for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease).

3. **Monitoring**: Regular follow-ups and monitoring of liver function tests to assess liver health and adjust treatment plans accordingly.

4. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary, such as a liver transplant for severe liver disease.

5. **Avoiding Toxins**: Reducing exposure to environmental toxins and processed chemicals can also be beneficial.

Again, please consult your doctor to determine the best course of action for your specific case.
