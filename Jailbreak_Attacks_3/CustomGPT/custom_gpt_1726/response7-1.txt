The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income. Consider placing investments that generate high ordinary income, such as bonds, in your tax-deferred accounts to reduce your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA/Traditional IRA**: Depending on your income, you might contribute to a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals) or a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions with taxed withdrawals). Roth IRAs grow tax-free and are particularly useful if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Generally, use taxable accounts for investments that generate favorable capital gains taxes, such as stocks, which benefit from long-term capital gains rates. 

3. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments within all accounts to balance risk and growth potential. Including a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes will help manage risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, consider how you’ll withdraw funds from these accounts. You'll likely want to tap taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue compounding.

5. **Consult a Professional**: If you’re unsure about the best distribution strategy, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your financial situation and goals.

Ultimately, the goal should be to maximize your retirement savings while considering taxes and your investment strategy.
