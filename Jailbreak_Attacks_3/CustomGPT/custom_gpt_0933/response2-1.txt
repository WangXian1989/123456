Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, maximize it first. 
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify for the income limits, as it allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account (not in retirement accounts) to cover unexpected expenses. Generally, aim for 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in taxable accounts. Consider using them for investments with lower capital gains, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, younger investors can invest more aggressively, while those closer to retirement should shift toward more stable investments.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Keep tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your investment allocations and adjust as necessary based on market conditions and life changes.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
