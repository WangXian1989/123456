To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high contribution limits or access to low-cost funds, maximize your contribution (up to the annual limit).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (for tax-free growth) or a traditional IRA (for potential tax-deductible contributions).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These can be useful for additional savings or short-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Adjust your investment strategy based on account type:
   - Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for less tax-efficient investments, like bonds or dividend-paying stocks, to take advantage of favorable tax rates.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to minimize risk.

6. **Investment Time Horizon**: Consider your financial goals and timelines:
   - Longer-term goals suit riskier investments.
   - Shorter-term goals may require more conservative investments.

7. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your asset distribution periodically to adapt to changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
