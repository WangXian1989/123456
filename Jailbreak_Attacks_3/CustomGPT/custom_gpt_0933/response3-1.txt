Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you meet the income limits, as future withdrawals are tax-free. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should generally be funded after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. Investments in taxable accounts are taxed on dividends and capital gains, so it's crucial to consider the types of investments you hold here.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Tailor your investment strategy based on how long you plan to invest and your comfort with risk. Typically, longer time horizons can justify more aggressive investments, especially in tax-advantaged accounts where growth is not taxed until withdrawal.

### 4. **Retirement Timeline**
   - If you're nearing retirement, consider shifting some investments in your 401(k) and IRA towards more conservative assets to protect your capital.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess Your Portfolio**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.

### Suggested Contribution Order
1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer match.
2. **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
3. **401(k)**: After meeting IRA limits, continue maxing out the 401(k).
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or after-tax investments.

### Consultation
Consider consulting with a financial advisor for a personalized strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.
