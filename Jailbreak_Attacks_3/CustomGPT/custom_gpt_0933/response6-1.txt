To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often comes with employer matching; contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains and dividends are subject to taxes in the year they're realized, but they also offer flexibility regarding withdrawals.

### 2. **Optimal Allocation Strategy**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **Prioritize Roth IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA next for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Fill Traditional IRA if Necessary**: Use a Traditional IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for assets that may generate capital gains, allowing for more control over timing.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for equity investments to maximize tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - **Income Generation**: Utilize taxable accounts for dividend-paying stocks or funds, considering tax implications.

### 4. **Maintain a Balanced Portfolio**
   - Keep a diversified investment mix in each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Regularly rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Favor tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs with low turnover) in your taxable accounts.

By following these strategies, you can create a well-structured investment plan that maximizes your savings potential and minimizes tax liabilities. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.
