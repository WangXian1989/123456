Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it’s free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

3. **Contribute to 401(k)**: After maxing your IRA, direct additional funds to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit, benefiting from tax deferral.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings. They’re flexible but be mindful of taxes on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts for balanced growth and risk management.

6. **Rebalance Annually**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your targeted risk level.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
