Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, timeline, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you can, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals if eligible. If not, focus on a traditional IRA.

### 2. **Assess Contribution Limits**
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits for each account type (e.g., 2023 limits are $22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs).

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term savings or investments that generate taxable income (like dividends). They are more flexible but less tax-efficient.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient ones (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjust**
   - Reassess your contributions and allocations yearly based on changes in financial goals or tax laws.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **Max out 401(k) contribution to the match limit (e.g., 5% of income)**
- **Contribute to IRA (preferably Roth, if eligible)**
- **Allocate remaining savings to taxable accounts based on goals**

### Conclusion
Tailor this strategy to your personal situation, considering factors such as your age, income, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice.
