Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors such as your age, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement goals. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you meet the income requirements, while a Traditional IRA can reduce your taxable income now.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If you can, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This provides tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After contributing to tax-advantaged accounts, use a taxable brokerage account for additional investments. This allows flexibility for withdrawal without penalties while also enabling investment in assets like stocks and bonds.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account type based on your risk tolerance. Consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating investments in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of when to realize gains or losses in taxable accounts to manage your tax liability effectively.

Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on your financial situation, age, risk tolerance, and market conditions. Consulting with a financial advisor can also be beneficial for personalized strategies.
