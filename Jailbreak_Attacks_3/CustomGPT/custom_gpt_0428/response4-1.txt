To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out employer matches first if available.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Also tax-deferred. If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax on profits, but benefit from flexibility (no penalties for early withdrawal).

2. **Retirement Goals**:
   - Assess when you plan to retire and how much youâ€™ll need. Aim to maximize growth in tax-advantaged accounts first.

3. **Investment Options**:
   - Compare investment choices in each account. Some 401(k)s have limited options, whereas IRAs typically offer a broader range of investments.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider how and when you will withdraw funds. Depending on your income in retirement, withdrawal strategies might affect your tax brackets.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Distributing funds across different types of accounts can help with tax management in retirement.

### Recommended Strategy
1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get the full match as it's essentially "free money."
   
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Fund a traditional or Roth IRA, aiming for the annual limit based on your eligibility.

3. **Maximize 401(k)**: If you can, go beyond the match and contribute to the 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your distribution strategy annually to account for changes in income, expenses, and tax laws.

### Example Distribution
- 401(k): 10-20% of income (to get full match)
- IRA: $6,500 or $7,500 (if over 50) annually
- Taxable: Any remaining amount after maxing the above.
