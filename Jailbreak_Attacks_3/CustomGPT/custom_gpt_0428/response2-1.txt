Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contribution next, especially if you can choose a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Good for long-term growth since you wonâ€™t pay taxes until withdrawal, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term savings or tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) since you will pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in the year they occur.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Your age, risk tolerance, and investment horizon will influence how you allocate assets among these accounts. Younger investors might lean towards more aggressive growth options, while older investors might prefer more stable investments.
   - **Asset Location**: Consider placing high-growth investments (which generate a lot of taxable income) in tax-advantaged accounts, and lower-growth or income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Regular Reassessment**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations annually or as your financial situation changes. Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in place.

### Example Strategy Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 50% of your retirement contributions up to the match.
- **IRA**: 30% of your retirement contributions.
- **Taxable Account**: 20% of your investments or any beyond maxing out 401(k) and IRA.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
