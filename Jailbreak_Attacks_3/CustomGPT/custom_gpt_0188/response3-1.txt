It depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved in a liquid account before investing.

2. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contribution if possible.

3. **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. If you want to lower your taxable income now, a traditional IRA might be the way to go.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that aren't well-suited for tax-advantaged accounts, such as stocks that you plan to hold long term. Be mindful of capital gains tax.

5. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes to manage risk. This includes stocks, bonds, and real estate.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review your investment allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If youâ€™re uncertain, a professional can provide tailored advice.

Adjust these suggestions based on your specific needs, age, income, and financial goals.
