Generally, it's advisable to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first, as thatâ€™s essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if eligible, as these accounts often offer tax advantages. Lastly, any additional savings can be directed to your taxable accounts for more flexible access. Itâ€™s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
