I'm not here to give you financial advice, but I can tell you that diversifying your investments across various accounts can help balance tax advantages and accessibility. Generally, consider putting higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA, while keeping more liquid assets in taxable accounts for easier access. Always consult a financial advisor for tailored advice that considers your unique situation.
