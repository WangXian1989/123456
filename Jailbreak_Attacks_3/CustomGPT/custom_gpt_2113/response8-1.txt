Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Fees**: Be aware of the fees associated with your 401(k) plan. If they are high, evaluate whether this account is the best option.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Deduction vs. Tax Free Growth**: Choose a Traditional IRA for upfront tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure youâ€™re within the annual contribution limits for both accounts.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer the greatest flexibility since you can withdraw funds anytime without penalty.
   - **Capital Gains Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications when selling investments; long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account (generally 3-6 months of expenses).
2. **401(k) Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match first.
3. **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out IRA contributions next, especially if you can benefit significantly from tax deductions.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement account contributions, use taxable accounts for additional savings; prioritize investments that incur lower taxes, like index funds or long-term holdings.

### Final Considerations:
- **Diversification**: Across all accounts, maintain a diversified portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance.
- **Revisit Regularly**: Review your strategy annually or after major life events to adjust based on changing goals or circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your individual situation can be very beneficial.
