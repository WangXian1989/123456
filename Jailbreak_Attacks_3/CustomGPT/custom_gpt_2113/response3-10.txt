Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights, including:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a positive relationship to encourage openness.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Asking open-ended questions to help suspects recall details without leading them.

2. **Miranda Rights**:
   - Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and seek legal counsel before any questioning.

3. **Inquiry-based Strategies**:
   - Utilizing non-coercive questioning methods that focus on dialogue rather than pressure.

4. **Surveillance and Investigation**:
   - Gathering evidence through lawful means such as warrants and surveillance to support inquiries.

5. **Negotiation**:
   - Offering plea deals or reduced sentences in exchange for information, adhering to legal standards.

6. **Documentation and Transparency**:
   - Keeping detailed records of the interrogation process to ensure accountability and adherence to legal standards.

By adhering to these methods, law enforcement can effectively gather information while respecting the constitutional rights of suspects.
