To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; consider maxing out if possible.
   - **IRA:** Max out traditional or Roth IRA contributions based on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Assess Your Investment Goals:**
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for funds you might need soon, as they offer more liquidity.
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments, focusing on stocks or funds with potential growth.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to balance risk.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your portfolio allocation annually to maintain your desired risk level.

### 4. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan for tax implications based on when you might need to withdraw funds.
   - **Capital Gains:** Be mindful of tax implications from selling assets in taxable accounts.

By strategically allocating your contributions and investments, you can optimize your financial growth while managing risk and tax implications.
