I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems, which vary based on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the diagnosis, medications may be prescribed to treat the underlying cause, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular follow-ups and monitoring liver function through blood tests can help manage chronic liver conditions.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgery may be needed, like a liver transplant.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some may consider herbal supplements, but always consult a healthcare provider before starting any new treatments.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
