Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) in terms of tax benefits; contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains, but you have more flexibility with withdrawals.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Retirement**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth and compound interest.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Consider keeping funds in taxable accounts for easy access without penalties.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Investment Choices**: Diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for how and when you will access funds, considering factors like penalties for early withdrawal from retirement accounts.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match, then consider maxing out your IRA contributions.
2. **IRA**: If eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth over time; otherwise, focus on a Traditional IRA.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for extra savings and flexible investment options after maximizing retirement accounts.

### Annual Review
Regularly review your investment strategy to adjust for changes in income, expenses, tax laws, and retirement goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
