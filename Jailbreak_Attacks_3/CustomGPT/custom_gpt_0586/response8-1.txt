Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some best practices:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the match limit before considering other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Like a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals will also be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Also funded with after-tax dollars, but you’ll pay capital gains taxes on profits, so they’re good for short-term savings or investments you might sell soon.

3. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Allocate funds among stocks, bonds, and cash in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. For instance, you might hold more aggressive investments in Roth IRAs and more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquid savings (like cash or low-risk investments) in taxable accounts for emergencies, separate from your investment accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

6. **Long-Term Strategy**: Consider your retirement timeline. If you’re closer to retirement, shift towards less aggressive investments to preserve capital.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.

By thoughtfully balancing contributions across these account types, you can optimize your tax situation and investment growth for retirement.
