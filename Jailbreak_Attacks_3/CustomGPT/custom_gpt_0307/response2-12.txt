I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general advice on liver health. Here are some common treatment options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopting a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.
   - **Weight Management**: Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce liver strain.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications might be prescribed (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Alcohol can further damage the liver, so limiting or eliminating intake is crucial.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and disease progression.

5. **Chronic Conditions Management**: Conditions like diabetes and high cholesterol can impact liver health and may need to be controlled.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary if the liver is failing.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
