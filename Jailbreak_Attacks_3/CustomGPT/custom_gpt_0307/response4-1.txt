The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out contributions if your employer offers a significant match. Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility. These accounts can provide access to funds without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts, taking into account the tax implications of your investment choices.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice from a qualified advisor can help align your investment strategy with your overall financial goals.

By strategically balancing contributions and considering tax implications, you can maximize your investment growth and readiness for retirement.
