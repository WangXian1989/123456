Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then consider maxing out an IRA.
- **Tax Benefits**: Use pre-tax contributions in a 401(k) and tax-free growth in a Roth IRA if eligible.

### 2. Assess Your Investment Goals
- **Retirement Focus**: Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth. Typically, younger investors can benefit from aggressive investments.
- **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for money you'll need in the next few years, considering liquidity.

### 3. Minimize Taxes
- **Placement Strategy**: Place high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes and lower capital gains in taxable accounts.
- **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Consider realizing losses in taxable accounts to offset gains and lower your overall tax burden.

### 4. Diversify Investments
- **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and age.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your goals and risk profile.

### 5. Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy
- **Retirement Withdrawals**: Plan your withdrawal strategy early. Consider tax implications for each account type during retirement.

### Summary
- Focus on maximizing employer contributions and tax-advantaged accounts first.
- Balance your investments according to your financial goals and timelines.
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to stay aligned with your objectives.
