The best strategy for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often involves considering a few key factors: 

1. **Tax Considerations**: Max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA first since they offer tax benefits. For example, contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income, while Roth IRA contributions are made after tax but grow tax-free.

2. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: If you're investing for the long term, consider higher-risk investments in your tax-advantaged accounts, as they can benefit from tax-free growth. Use taxable accounts for more immediate goals where you might need access to funds sooner.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how you will withdraw money in retirement. It might be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing, particularly if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to spread risk. Each account type can hold a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice specific to your situation, including your income, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. 

Always make sure your investments align with your long-term financial objectives.
