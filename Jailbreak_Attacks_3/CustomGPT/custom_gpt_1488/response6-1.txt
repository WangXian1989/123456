To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then maximize your IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional, depending on your tax situation).
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts which offer liquidity and the ability to access funds without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Match Assets to Goals**: Align risk profiles based on your time horizon; longer-term goals can be more aggressive (e.g., equities), while shorter-term needs may require more conservative investments (e.g., bonds).
   - **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations based on performance, changes in goals, or life events to ensure alignment.

By following these guidelines, you'll create a balanced, tax-efficient investment strategy that prepares you for both short-term liquidity needs and long-term growth.
