Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k), consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, making it a strong option for younger savers.

### 2. **Assess Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax impact. Consider holding bonds or high-turnover funds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher tax rates on income.

### 3. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your overall investment strategy (stocks, bonds, cash) aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts. A balanced mix can mitigate risk and enhance growth potential.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how and when you will withdraw from each account in retirement. Generally, itâ€™s tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA), and leave tax-free accounts (Roth IRA) to grow longer.

### Summary
- Prioritize maxing out your 401(k) match and IRAs.
- Use taxable accounts for long-term growth investments.
- Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts tailored to your tax situation and goals.

This strategic approach can help enhance your overall financial growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
