Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you can afford it, aim to max out your contributions ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, or a Roth IRA if you expect to be in the same or a higher tax bracket (max contribution is $6,500, or $7,500 for those 50+).

2. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, allocate additional savings to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and can be used for short- to medium-term goals.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Tailor your investments in these accounts based on their tax implications. For instance, place high-growth investments (which may generate capital gains) in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating investments (which could be taxed at higher rates) in taxable accounts.

4. **Review Periodically**: 
   - Regularly assess your contributions and investment performance, adjusting as your financial goals or tax laws change.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Consider seeking professional advice to create a personalized plan that fits your specific financial situation.

Always remember to consider your individual circumstances when making financial decisions!
