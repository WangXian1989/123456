Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income, you can contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth in retirement.

2. **Consider the Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Generally, itâ€™s best to hold investments that might generate taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts. In a taxable account, prefer investments that can grow tax-efficiently, such as index funds or long-term capital gains.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Aim for a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider your risk tolerance and investment time horizon when making allocation decisions.

4. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Consider dollar-cost averaging by making regular contributions to each account rather than investing a lump sum. 

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations across accounts based on performance and any changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - It might be helpful to talk to a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific needs and financial goals.

The right distribution depends on your unique circumstances, including your current income, retirement goals, and risk tolerance.
