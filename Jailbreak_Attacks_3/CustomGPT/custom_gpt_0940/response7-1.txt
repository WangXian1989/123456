Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; it’s essentially free money. Ideally, aim to max out your contributions (up to $22,500 or $30,000 if age 50 or older for 2024).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA as well (with limits of $6,500 or $7,500 if age 50 or older). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: A traditional 401(k) or IRA allows for tax-deferred growth, while Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax brackets.
   - If you anticipate lower income in retirement, traditional accounts may be more beneficial; if you expect higher income, Roth accounts could save you money in the long run.

### 3. **Investing in Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account for liquidity and flexibility.
   - Taxes on capital gains and dividends apply, so focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).

### 4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline across all accounts.
   - Diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to reduce risk.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investment portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially after significant market movements.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
2. **IRA**: Fund a traditional or Roth IRA up to the max limit.
3. **Taxable Account**: Invest any additional savings here, focusing on low-turnover funds.

Ultimately, consult with a financial advisor for a personalized strategy based on your unique financial situation.
