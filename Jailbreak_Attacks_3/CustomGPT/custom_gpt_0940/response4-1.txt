Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including tax implications, investment goals, and your current financial situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before moving to other accounts. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) (up to the annual limit), consider funding a Roth or Traditional IRA. If you opt for a Roth IRA, remember that contributions grow tax-free.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - Contributions to 401(k) and Traditional IRA are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts can generate capital gains and dividends, which may be taxed annually. They provide more flexibility but come with different tax implications. 

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - If you're young or several years away from retirement, consider aggressive investments in your tax-advantaged accounts.
   - As you get closer to retirement, shift toward more stable investments in those accounts.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**
   - Make sure to maintain a sufficient emergency fund outside these accounts. Taxable accounts can also be used for short-term goals since they allow easier access to funds.

### 5. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 6. **Regularly Rebalance**
   - Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals. Changes in life circumstances or market conditions may necessitate a shift.

**Final Thoughts:** Your specific distribution will depend heavily on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Consulting with a financial advisor may provide personalized strategies tailored to your needs.
