Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be strategic for optimizing tax benefits and retirement savings. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you’re under 50, you can contribute up to $22,500 (as of 2023) pre-tax. This reduces your taxable income now.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing traditional accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) may be beneficial.
   - If you anticipate a higher tax bracket, contributing to a Roth account may be smarter.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for flexibility. They allow you to access funds without penalties (unlike retirement accounts), though they are subject to capital gains tax.

5. **Diversification of Investments**: Within each account, ensure you're diversified to manage risk. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your allocations regularly (at least annually) to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Individual circumstances vary, so consider seeking advice tailored to your specific situation.

This balanced approach can help maximize your savings and tax advantages over time.
