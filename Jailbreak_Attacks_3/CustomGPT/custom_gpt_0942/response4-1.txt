Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - **Traditional IRA** offers tax deductions now but taxes on withdrawals later.
     - **Roth IRA** is funded with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are flexible and can be accessed anytime, but interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxable in the year they're received.

3. **Investment Horizon**: If you’re investing for the long term (e.g., retirement), focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA). For shorter-term goals, taxable accounts may be more appropriate due to their liquidity.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diverse portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, it may be beneficial to draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.

As a starting point, many people aim for a mix that prioritizes tax-advantaged accounts while ensuring they have adequate liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs.
