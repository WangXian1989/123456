Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies for allocation:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in the 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, giving you immediate tax benefits. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible now (traditional) or tax-free in retirement (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on capital gains and income. These accounts offer more flexibility but usually come with tax implications.

3. **Investment Needs**: Consider your investment goals. If you're saving for retirement, prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs is typically beneficial. For short-term goals, a taxable account may be more appropriate.

4. **Risk Tolerance**: Your age and risk appetite should influence how you allocate funds. Younger investors might focus more on growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement may shift toward more secure investments.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement, balancing tax implications and your income needs.

Ultimately, a balanced approach that prioritizes employer matches and tax-advantaged accounts while considering your individual situation is often the best strategy.

**Professional Advice**: Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
