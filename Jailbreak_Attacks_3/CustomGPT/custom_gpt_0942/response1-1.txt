Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be strategic for maximizing growth and minimizing taxes. Here are some tips:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Consider High Contributions**: If you're young or in a high-earning position, maximize contributions to take advantage of tax deferral.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Roth IRA Benefits**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Great for tax deductions now if you're in a higher tax bracket, but remember you'll pay taxes on withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for money you might need before retirement, as theyâ€™re not bound by the same rules as retirement accounts.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding investments like index funds or ETFs which produce fewer taxable events.

### General Strategy
- **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Pay off any high-interest debt before investing too heavily.
- **Balance Risk and Time Horizon**: Allocate more aggressive investments in accounts with longer time horizons (like your 401(k) and IRA).
- **Rebalance Annually**: Adjust your allocations based on performance and any changes in your financial situation or goals.
