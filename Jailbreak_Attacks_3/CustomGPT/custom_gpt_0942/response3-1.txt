Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Traditional vs. Roth Accounts**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal. Useful if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, meaning withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. Beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have liquid savings in place (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Debt Management**: Pay off high-interest debt before heavily investing. The return on debt reduction can often exceed the return on investments.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for assets that are likely to grow significantly (e.g., stocks) since youâ€™ll defer taxes on the gains.
   - Investments in taxable accounts may include bonds or dividend stocks, which generate taxable income.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Consider the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts, as capital gains taxes may apply. 

7. **Investment Horizon**: Align your investments with your time frame. Long-term investments can afford more volatility.

8. **Regular Review**: Periodically assess and rebalance your portfolio according to your goals and changes in the market.
