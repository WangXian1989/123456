The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has higher contribution limits, and employer matching can boost savings. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your current taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: IRAs have lower contribution limits. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Offer the greatest flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes on investments sold for a profit.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to take advantage of compound growth without immediate tax liability.
   - Use your traditional IRA for investments expected to grow significantly, as the tax deferral can be very beneficial.
   - Utilize Roth IRAs if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as you’ll pay taxes at your current (lower) rate now.

4. **Diversify Investment Across Accounts**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider holding high-growth or interest-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher tax rates on dividends and interest income.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation based on your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about how to allocate your funds, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

Evaluating your specific circumstances and goals is crucial in making the most informed decision regarding your investment strategy.
