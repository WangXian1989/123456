Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you haven’t maxed out your contributions, contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2024, plus a $7,500 catch-up if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). The limit for 2024 is $6,500, with a $1,000 catch-up for those 50 and older.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, but distributions in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts generate capital gains and dividends, which are taxable in the year they’re realized.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Choose an asset allocation strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Growth-oriented investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and align with changing market conditions or life circumstances.

6. **Emergency Fund and Debt**: Always ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund and consider paying down high-interest debt before heavily investing.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances can significantly affect the best strategy, so consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored guidance.

These steps will help you create a balanced approach to investing across different types of accounts.
