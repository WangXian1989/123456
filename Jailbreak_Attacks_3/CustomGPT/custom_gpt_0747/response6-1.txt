When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deductions and tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains and qualified dividends, as they may be taxed at lower rates.

2. **Investment Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on higher-growth investments here, as withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income upon retirement.
   - **IRA**: For a Roth IRA, consider holding assets expected to appreciate significantly, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Include index funds or ETFs for lower turnover and fewer taxable events.

3. **Balancing Contributions**:
   - Set a contribution strategy based on employer matching (max out 401(k) contributions to gain any available match).
   - After maximizing employer contributions, consider contributing to IRAs, focusing on Roth if eligible, or traditional depending on your current income level.

4. **Review & Adjust**:
   - Regularly assess your portfolio allocation across these accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Adjust contributions based on changes in tax laws, personal income, and financial objectives.

Balancing these accounts effectively will optimize your tax situation and investment growth potential over the long term.
