(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, income level, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, it’s advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA first, especially if you have employer matching contributions in your 401(k). 

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional, depending on your tax situation) to benefit from additional tax advantages.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to take advantage of lower tax rates on those earnings.

It’s essential to regularly review and adjust your allocation based on market conditions and personal financial changes.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s break this down! If you want to spread your cash across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here's the lowdown:

1. **Max Out That 401(k)**: First off, hit up your 401(k) especially if your employer matches contributions. That’s like free money, dude! Don’t leave it on the table.
   
2. **Get Your IRA Game On**: Next, throw some cash into an IRA. A Roth IRA is fab if you expect your tax rate to be higher later. Traditional IRA? Great if you want a tax break now.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Lastly, toss some funds into taxable accounts for more liquid investments. They’re handy for when you want to access money without penalties, and you can still make money from long-term capital gains, which are taxed lower!

Mix and match based on your risk tolerance, age, and where you think tax laws might change. Always stay sharp and keep an eye on what works best for you!
