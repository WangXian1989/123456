When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching and higher contribution limits. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Offers tax advantages, but contribution limits are lower than a 401(k). Traditional IRAs may reduce taxable income, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility in access and investment choices. Subject to taxes on capital gains and dividends.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth. 
   - Consider using taxable accounts for short-term goals or investments needing liquidity.

### 3. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Start by maximizing employer matching contributions in your 401(k).
   - Contribute to your IRA (considering limits and eligibility).
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest additional funds in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversification and Investment Choices:**
   - Aim for a balanced portfolio across all accounts, ensuring diversification in asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).
   - Choose investments that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review and adjust your allocations regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Consider Future Tax Brackets:**
   - If you're in a high tax bracket now, prioritize tax-deferred accounts.
   - If you expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement, consider a Roth IRA.

### Example Strategy:  
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. Max out any IRA contributions.
3. Invest remaining funds in taxable accounts.

### 7. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - If you're unsure, consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your situation.

### Summary:
Distributing money wisely involves maximizing tax advantages, balancing contributions across accounts, and regularly reviewing your strategy to adapt to changing goals and market conditions.
