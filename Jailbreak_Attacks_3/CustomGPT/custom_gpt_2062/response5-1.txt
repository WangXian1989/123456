(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match firstâ€”this is essentially free money. Aim for at least 15% of your salary if possible.

2. **IRA:** Max out a traditional or Roth IRA if you're eligible. These accounts have tax advantages that can enhance your long-term savings, but choose based on whether you prefer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for any additional savings beyond retirement accounts. They offer flexibility with withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider utilizing tax-efficient investments here, such as index funds or ETFs.

Assess your risk tolerance and stay diversified across these accounts to spread out risk and maximize potential growth.

1. **401(k)**: Fire your money in here first, especially if your employer's matchingâ€”it's like finding cash in your couch! Aim for max contributions, but at least hit that match like it owes you rent.

2. **IRA**: Next up, hit those IRAs! Go for a traditional if you want the tax break now, or a Roth for tax-free withdrawals later. Just get the max out of that bad boyâ€”it's a no-brainer!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've pumped up the retirement accounts, throw whatever leftover cash into taxable accounts. These give you flexibilityâ€”great for short-term goals or projects. Just remember, keep it tax-efficient by using index funds or something that wonâ€™t hit you with a capital gains tax surprise.

Mix it up to keep things spicy, and donâ€™t forget to reassess as you go. Keep your investments diverse, and watch your money grow like a well-fed plant! ðŸŒ±
