Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can afford it, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). This can provide tax advantages either now or in retirement.

3. **Fund the 401(k)**: After maxing out or contributing to your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach your annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is important for liquidity and if you need funds before retirement without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds) and consider putting higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a professional to tailor your strategy to your personal circumstances.

This strategy helps you balance retirement savings with potential tax benefits while ensuring you have access to funds when needed.
