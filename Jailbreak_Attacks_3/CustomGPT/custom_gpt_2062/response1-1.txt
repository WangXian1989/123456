Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s free money!

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRAs (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your tax situation, consider maximizing your IRA contributions. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.
   - **401(k)**: After your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate extra funds here. These accounts offer flexibility, but you'll pay taxes on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Consider Time Horizon**: If you’re investing for the long term (like retirement), favor growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRAs. For shorter-term goals, allocate more to your taxable account.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your asset allocation annually based on performance and changing life circumstances.

6. **Consult a Pro**: A financial advisor can tailor these strategies to your specific needs.

This strategy helps optimize tax efficiency while working towards your financial goals.
