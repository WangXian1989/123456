Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing up to the annual limit, especially if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket, as contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income level and eligibility.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need access to before retirement. Investments in these accounts may be taxed on capital gains and dividends, so choose tax-efficient investments.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investment choices reflect a diverse portfolio to mitigate risk.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in easily accessible accounts before heavily investing.

6. **Future Goals**: Consider your future goals, such as buying a home or funding education, which may influence how much you allocate towards taxable accounts.

7. **Adjust as Needed**: Reassess your distribution annually based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement timelines.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your unique situation.
