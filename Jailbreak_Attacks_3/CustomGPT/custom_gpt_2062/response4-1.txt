Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRAs**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA (either Traditional or Roth) for potential tax advantages, depending on your income situation.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: Once your IRA is maxed, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Consider taxable accounts for additional savings, especially for shorter-term goals or if you've maxed out your retirement accounts. Investments in taxable accounts can offer flexibility and may have favorable capital gains tax rates on long-term holdings.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure you have a strategic asset allocation across all accounts, adjusting for taxes and your investment strategy.

6. **Review Regularly**: Revisit your plan regularly to adjust contributions based on income changes and market conditions.

If you have specific financial details or goals, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor the strategy to your needs.
