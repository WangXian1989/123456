It's important to consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon when distributing your money among different types of accounts. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider how much you can contribute based on your overall retirement plan. The 401(k) often has limited investment options, so choose a good mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: After contributing to your 401(k) and if you qualify, consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages that can benefit your long-term growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need before retirement or for investments that don’t fit in tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize taxable gains.

**Considerations**:
- **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate).
- **Tax Efficiency**: Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs) to minimize tax liabilities.
- **Regular Review**: Reassess your asset allocation and contributions regularly as your financial situation and market conditions change.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to develop a tailored strategy.
