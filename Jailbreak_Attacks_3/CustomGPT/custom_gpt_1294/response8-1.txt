Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to meet any employer match—this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: If you can, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are tax-free on withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you're in a lower tax bracket. They offer flexibility but lack the tax advantages of retirement accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that all accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how withdrawals will be made in retirement—typically, you would draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (like 401(k)s), and finally from tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

6. **Regular Reassessment**: Review and adjust your allocations regularly based on changing financial situations and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
