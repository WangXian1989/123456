To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Determine whether a Traditional or Roth IRA is better for you based on your tax situation. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth might be advantageous.

3. **Target Retirement Accounts**: Allocate more to retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) initially if you are aiming for long-term growth. This allows for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may want to access before retirement age, ensuring you have liquid funds available without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account, diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk. Consider age-based portfolios or target-date funds for a set-it-and-forget-it approach.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio as your financial situation and market conditions change.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts, and consider holding onto them long-term to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced investment strategy that aligns with your retirement goals while also ensuring flexibility as needed.
