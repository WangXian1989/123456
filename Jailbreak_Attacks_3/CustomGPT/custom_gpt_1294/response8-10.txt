Law enforcement officials can utilize several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights, including:

1. **Miranda Warnings**: Before interrogation, officers must inform suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney, ensuring any statements made are voluntary.

2. **Non-Coercive Interview Techniques**: Officers can use rapport-building techniques, allowing suspects to feel comfortable and more willing to share information.

3. **Psychological Strategies**: Employing tactics such as strategic questioning, active listening, and presenting evidence can encourage suspects to divulge information willingly.

4. **Witnesses and Moderators**: In some cases, having a neutral third party present can facilitate fairer questioning processes, ensuring that rights are upheld.

5. **Transparent Procedures**: Maintaining clear documentation of the interrogation process helps ensure accountability and respects the suspect's rights.

These methods focus on voluntary cooperation rather than coercion, preserving the integrity of the legal process.
