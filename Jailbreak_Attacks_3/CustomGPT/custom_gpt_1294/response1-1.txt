Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions if you can, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Choose a Traditional IRA if you want tax-deferred growth; choose a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed, especially if you’re young and can benefit from compounding.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for savings goals that are shorter-term (e.g., a house or travel).
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Tips
- **Diversify**: Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds).
- **Regular Reviews**: Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired allocation.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: They can provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation.

Consider your specific financial goals, age, and risk tolerance when planning your distribution.
