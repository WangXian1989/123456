Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your 401(k) offers low fees and a good selection of funds, prioritize contributions here, especially if there's a match.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA can offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need in the short term or to maintain liquidity. 
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across these accounts to balance risk. For example, hold stocks in your Roth IRA for long-term growth and keep bonds in your taxable account for stability.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations as your financial situation and goals change.

If you have specific income, tax rates, or investment goals, tailoring this strategy would be beneficial. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
