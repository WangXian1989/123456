Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; consider maxing out if possible since contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA**: Utilize Roth or traditional IRAs based on your current tax bracket and future expectations. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable gains (like ETFs or index funds) and hold onto them long-term to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Efficient Withdrawals**: Withdraw from accounts in an order that minimizes taxesâ€”typically from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (401(k), IRA), and lastly tax-free (Roth IRA).

### 3. **Balance Risk and Growth**
   - **401(k) & IRA**: Often have a broader selection of funds; consider more aggressive investments here for growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Keep a balance of security and growth, adjusting according to market performance.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Liquid Assets**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before heavily investing in any retirement or taxable accounts.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**
   - Regularly reassess your asset allocation based on market performance and your changing financial goals.

### Conclusion
Tailor your contributions based on tax implications, growth potential, and your time horizon. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
