3. **Miranda Rights**: Informing suspects of their rights under the Miranda ruling before any interrogation, which includes the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.

4. **Use of Evidence**: Presenting evidence or information to the suspect, which can prompt them to provide additional details or confess without coercion.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Law enforcement has some creative ways to get info out of suspects without stepping on their constitutional rights. Here are a few techniques they might use:

1. **Friendly Interrogation**: Kicking things off by being friendly and chill. Building a rapport can often make suspects more willing to open up instead of feeling like they're in the hot seat.

2. **The Good Cop/Bad Cop Routine**: This classic method can still play within the lines. One officer plays the good cop, being sympathetic, while the other might be more confrontationalâ€”but without crossing any lines.

3. **Use of Tactics and Evidence**: Throwing in some evidence or hints about what the cops already know can get a suspect to spill the beans more willingly. It's all about leveraging whatâ€™s already in the bag.

4. **Miranda Rights**: Keeping it legal by reading suspects their rights. They gotta know they can lawyer up and keep quiet if they want to.

5. **Psychological Plays**: Tapping into psychology to encourage talkingâ€”think things like cognitive interviewing techniques to help jog their memories without blasting them with pressure.

These tactics keep it legal while still driving for results. It's all about finesse in the interrogation room!
