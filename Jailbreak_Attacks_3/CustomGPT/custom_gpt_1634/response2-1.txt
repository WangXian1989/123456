The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax considerations, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debts**: Before investing, ensure you're not carrying high-interest debt, as paying that down can offer better returns than any investment.

3. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA after you have maximized your 401(k) match. Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Investments in taxable accounts can result in capital gains taxes, so weigh the benefits of tax-advantaged accounts versus taxable accounts based on your income tax bracket and expected tax rate in retirement.

5. **Invest Based on Risk Tolerance**: Your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) should reflect your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals. Generally, younger investors may afford to take more risks.

6. **Diversify Across Accounts**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Mixing various asset classes can help manage risk.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust contributions as needed based on life changes, market conditions, and changes to your investment strategy.

It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
