The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting additional funds into an IRA or taxable accounts.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** 
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits that can help your investments grow more efficiently.
   - For the IRA, you may choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions but taxed on withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (contributions made with after-tax dollars, tax-free withdrawals).

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:** 
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals.
   - If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) may save you more on taxes now.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement or for short-term financial goals. Remember that capital gains tax may apply when selling investments in these accounts.

5. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to manage risk.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: 
   - Periodically review your allocation and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.
