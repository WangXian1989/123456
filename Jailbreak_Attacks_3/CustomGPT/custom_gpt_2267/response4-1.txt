To provide tailored advice on distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, hereâ€™s a clear outline:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**: Often employer-sponsored, may come with matching contributions; tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, with potential tax advantages. Options include Traditional and Roth IRAs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible investment options that donâ€™t have tax advantages but allow quicker access to funds.

### 2. **Consider Your Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Short-term needs**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 3. **Maximize Contributions**
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match.
   - Max out your IRA contributions, while considering whether to choose a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon:
     - **Stocks** for growth.
     - **Bonds** for stability.
     - **Consider index funds or ETFs** for cost efficiency.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate favorable long-term capital gains.

### 6. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your goals and market changes.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation, consider speaking to a financial professional.
