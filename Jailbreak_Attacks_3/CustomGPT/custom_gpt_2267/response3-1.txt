### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with tax advantages; pre-tax contributions reduce taxable income.
- **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account; traditional IRAs allow tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages; capital gains taxes apply.

### 2. Consider Your Goals
- Define your **retirement goals**: When do you plan to retire? What kind of lifestyle do you envision?
- Assess **tax implications** based on your current vs. future tax bracket.
- Factor in your **investment timeline**: Are you saving for near-term goals, or is your focus solely on retirement?

### 3. Allocation Strategies
- **Percentage Allocations**: A common approach is to prioritize retirement accounts:
  - Max out contributions to your 401(k) (up to employer match).
  - Contribute to an IRA (considering whether to choose Roth or Traditional).
  - Use any excess funds for taxable accounts.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate based on your comfort with risk. Higher-risk investments may be better suited to long-term accounts.

### 4. Tax Efficiency
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize these accounts as they offer growth without immediate tax implications.
- **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Typically, hold investments that have lower turnover (to minimize taxes) or investments with favorable tax treatment (like qualified dividends).

### 5. Regular Review and Adjustment
- **Monitor Allocations**: Regularly assess your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with goals and market conditions.
- **Rebalance Strategy**: Periodically adjust the asset mix to maintain desired risk levels and take advantage of market changes.

### Conclusion
Distributing your money effectively requires a balance of strategic planning and continual evaluation. By understanding the characteristics of each account type and aligning your investments with your financial goals, you can maximize growth and minimize taxes.
