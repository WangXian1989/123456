To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### Outline

1. **Understand Your Accounts**
   - Tax advantages of each account
   - Contribution limits
   - Withdrawal rules
2. **Assess Your Goals**
   - Short-term vs. long-term goals
   - Retirement timeline
3. **Tax Considerations**
   - Tax-deferred growth
   - Capital gains implications
4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Asset allocation
   - Risk tolerance
5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regular review of account performance
   - Adjust based on life changes

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Understand Your Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Great for employer matching and tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Offers tax deductions (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility for withdrawals but taxed on capital gains.

2. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Determine what youâ€™re saving for: retirement, a home, etc.
   - Align your investment horizon with your goals.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Max out contributions to accounts with tax advantages first (like 401(k) and IRA).
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments that you may need to access sooner.

4. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - Spread investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).
   - Consider your risk toleranceâ€”higher risk with higher potential returns may be suitable for retirement accounts due to their longer time horizon.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly check the performance of your investments and rebalance as necessary.
   - Life changes (new job, marriage, etc.) may necessitate a reevaluation of your strategy.

### Final Thoughts

For optimal growth and tax efficiency, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first, then allocate surplus funds to taxable accounts based on your financial goals and market conditions. Regularly review your allocations to adapt to changes in your life or the market.
