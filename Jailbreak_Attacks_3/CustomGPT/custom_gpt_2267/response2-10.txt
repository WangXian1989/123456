### 4. **Incentives for Cooperation**
   - **Plea Deals**: Offering reduced charges or leniency in exchange for information.
   - **Immunity Offers**: Providing legal immunity for cooperation.

### 5. **Polygraph Tests**
   - **Use of Lie Detectors**: Conducting polygraph tests, but only with the suspect‚Äôs consent.

### 6. **Interrogation Rooms**
   - **Environment Control**: Using a controlled and safe environment that doesn't feel threatening to the suspect.

### 7. **Psychological Techniques**
   - **Non-Confrontational Approaches**: Using strategies that involve understanding the suspect's perspective and motivations.

### 8. **Third-Party Involvement**
