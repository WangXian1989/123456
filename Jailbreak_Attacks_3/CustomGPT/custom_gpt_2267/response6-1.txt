To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following outline:

### **1. Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Retirement age**: Determine when you plan to retire.
   - **Investment horizon**: Understand how long you can leave your investments to grow.

### **2. Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax; however, they offer flexibility for withdrawals.

### **3. Allocate Funds Strategically**
   - **Max out employer match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer matching.
   - **Ira Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate higher returns and may not fit well into tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., real estate investment trusts or stocks).

### **4. Consider Asset Allocation**
   - **Growth Investments**: Favor riskier investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts due to their long-term growth potential.
   - **Income Investments**: Place stable, income-producing investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

### **5. Reassess Regularly**
   - **Annual Review**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on market conditions, life changes, and investment performance.

### **Conclusion**
By understanding your goals and tax implications, you can create a distribution strategy that maximizes growth and minimizes tax liabilities.
