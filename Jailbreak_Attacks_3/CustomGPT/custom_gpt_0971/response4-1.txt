Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with matching contributions, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA. If you are eligible for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional Accounts**: Contributions to traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are tax-deductible, which can reduce your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax. These accounts can provide flexibility for withdrawals but may not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Ensure that the assets within each account are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Stocks typically offer higher potential returns but come with higher risk, while bonds tend to be more stable.

4. **Emergency Fund and Liquid Assets**:
   - Before heavily investing in retirement accounts, ensure you have emergency savings in a liquid account (like a savings account) that can cover 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Align the distribution with your long-term financial goals. If you're aiming for early retirement, you may want to prioritize contributions in ways that allow for early access to funds.

6. **Revisit and Adjust**:
   - Regularly revisit your strategies as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.
