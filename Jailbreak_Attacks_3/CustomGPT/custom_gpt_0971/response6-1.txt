To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies: 

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax (Traditional) or post-tax (Roth). If you're in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize this account for potential tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), a Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose your account type based on your future tax expectations.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts do not have the same tax benefits, so aim to hold assets that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs.

2. **Investment Goals and Timeline**:
   - **Short-Term Goals**: If you need access to funds within a few years, utilize a taxable account for liquidity.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: For retirement savings, max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions first, as they provide the most benefits over time.

3. **Diversification and Risk Management**:
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, factoring in your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - Reassess your allocation periodically to adjust for market changes and life events.

In summary, prioritize your 401(k) and IRA for tax advantages and long-term growth while using taxable accounts for flexibility and short-term needs. It's advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor your strategy according to your specific situation.
