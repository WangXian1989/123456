Distributing your money among a 401(k), an IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, investment options, and time horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Retirement Accounts**: After the employer match, consider maxing out contributions to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're currently in a lower tax bracket, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial in the long run.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. This can include stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Keep in mind that capital gains taxes apply to profits in these accounts, so consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stocks generally offer higher returns but come with greater risk, while bonds are steadier but typically provide lower returns.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow and market conditions change, review and rebalance your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your investment strategy.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: If youâ€™re uncertain, consider consulting with a financial advisor. They can provide tailored advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

In summary, prioritize contributions to accounts with employer matches, then maximize tax-advantaged accounts, and finally allocate funds to taxable accounts while keeping an eye on your overall asset allocation.
