Distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money). If possible, aim to max out contributions.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income, you may qualify for a deductible Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Consider using a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers a limited investment selection. Focus on low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Offers more extensive investment options. You can diversify across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).

### 3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - Taxable accounts are good for goals outside retirement. Once you’ve maxed out retirement accounts, consider:
     - Investing in index funds or ETFs for lower tax implications due to minimal turnover.
     - Using tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

### 4. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Withdrawals**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type. For instance, 401(k) and Traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals may be tax-free.
   - **Future Tax Considerations**: If you expect your income to rise, consider prioritizing Roth contributions.

### 5. **Adjust for Risk and Time Horizon**
   - Keep a balanced portfolio according to your risk tolerance, with aggressive investments in accounts where taxes are deferred (401(k) and IRA) and potentially safer investments in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**
   - Life circumstances, tax laws, and financial goals may change. Review your distribution strategy annually.

### Example Allocation
- Max out 401(k) to employer match.
- Contribute to IRA.
- Invest in taxable accounts after maxing retirement accounts.
