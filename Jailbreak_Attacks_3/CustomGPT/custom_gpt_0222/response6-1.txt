Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Ensure you contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth) suits your situation better.

### 2. **Assess Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: Check annual contribution limits; as of 2023, it's $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA**: The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

### 3. **Build a Tax Strategy**
   - **Invest for Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on long-term growth investments like stocks, which can benefit from tax-free growth in IRAs and 401(k)s.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for More Liquid Investments**: Hold bonds or cash-equivalents here since they may have less favorable tax treatment in retirement accounts.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Keep a diversified mix based on your risk tolerance—stocks, bonds, real estate, etc., across all accounts.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess and rebalance to maintain your desired risk level.

### Final Tips
- **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Tailor strategies based on personal financial situations.
- **Stay Informed**: Keep abreast of changes in tax laws and retirement account rules.

By strategically distributing your investments among these accounts, you can optimize your savings and reduce your tax burden over time.
