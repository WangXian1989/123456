Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match first.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Consider Tax Implications**: Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversification**: Use IRAs for investments that you believe will appreciate significantly, taking advantage of tax benefits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more liquidity and fewer restrictions on withdrawals. 
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Try to max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions before investing heavily in taxable accounts.
- **Assess Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment goals across each account type.
- **Monitor and Rebalance**: Regularly review your investments and rebalance to maintain your desired allocation.

### Final Considerations
Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
