(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. A general approach is:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, especially if there are employer matching programs for the 401(k). Aim to contribute the maximum allowed.

2. **Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications of each account type. Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are well-diversified across all accounts, considering risk tolerance. Equities may be suitable for long-term growth, while bonds can offer stability.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement, which may influence how you fund each account now.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that suits your unique situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) If you're looking to distribute your money smartly across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, hereâ€™s the game plan:

1. **401(k) First**: Max out that 401(k), especially if your employer matches contributions. It's free money! Hit that limit like it's your gym goal.

2. **IRAs Next**: After crushing the 401(k), throw some cash into a traditional or Roth IRA. The Roth is sweet since you can pull out tax-free cash laterâ€”who doesnâ€™t love tax-free cash?

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out those retirement accounts, use a taxable account for more flexibility. Just watch out for that capital gains tax; it can sneak up on you!

4. **Diversify**: Mix it up! Stocks for growth, bonds for stabilityâ€”think of it like balancing your diet, but for your money.

5. **Be Strategic**: Think about when youâ€™ll need the money. If you need it sooner, keep it in more accessible forms. 

6. **Pro Tip**: Check in with a financial advisorâ€”kinda like getting a coach for your money game!
