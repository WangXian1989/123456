The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement. These accounts can provide more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Hold more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) here, as they generate ordinary income.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your total portfolio is diversified across different asset classes to manage risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique situation.
