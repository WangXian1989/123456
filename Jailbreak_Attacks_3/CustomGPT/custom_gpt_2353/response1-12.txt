Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can suggest that the best course of action for any liver problem is to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice based on your specific condition. Treatment options may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications, or potentially more advanced therapies depending on the severity of the issue. Always prioritize your health and seek professional guidance!
