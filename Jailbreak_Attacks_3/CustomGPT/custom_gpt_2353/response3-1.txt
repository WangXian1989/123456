Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k)):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is effectively free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA):** After taking advantage of the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer significant tax benefits, with Roth IRAs providing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** If you can afford to, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. This reduces your taxable income and grows your retirement savings tax-deferred.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. They provide more flexibility since you can access your money anytime without penalties.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation and Tax Implications:** Allocate investments strategically based on their tax treatment. For example, hold bonds and other income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while keeping stocks in taxable accounts where they may benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustment:** Regularly review your asset allocation and potentially rebalance your portfolio according to market changes and your financial goals. 

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you’re uncertain about your strategy, working with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

This approach helps you optimize growth, manage tax implications, and maintain flexibility for your financial needs both now and in retirement.
