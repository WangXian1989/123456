Î± To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies: 

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.
   
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Allocate funds towards an IRA (Roth or Traditional) next. These accounts offer tax benefits that can grow your savings over time. Choose Roth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. Opt for Traditional if you want an immediate tax deduction.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once contributions to tax-advantaged accounts are maxed or if you've hit contribution limits, direct additional funds to taxable accounts. These offer more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Strategically allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, higher-risk investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from long-term growth and tax-free or deferred gains.

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.
