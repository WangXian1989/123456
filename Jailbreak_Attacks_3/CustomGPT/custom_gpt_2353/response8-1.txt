The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, investment goals, and risk tolerance. However, here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. IRAs often provide more investment options compared to a 401(k) and can offer significant tax advantages.

3. **Continue to Fund Your 401(k)**: Once you've maxed out any contributions to your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. This helps you save more for retirement with tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any additional savings can be placed in taxable accounts. These accounts do not have the same tax advantages as 401(k)s and IRAs but offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Invest tax-efficient assets (like ETFs) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts. This strategy helps maximize your after-tax returns.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your investment allocation and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about how to allocate your investments, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor. They can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money that aligns with your overall financial goals.
