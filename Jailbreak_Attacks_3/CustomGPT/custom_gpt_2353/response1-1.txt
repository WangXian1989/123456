Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA, if eligible, can be particularly beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These can provide flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments. Use these for goals with a shorter time horizon or for retirement if you've already maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure your investment choices across these accounts align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks, bonds, and other assets should be spread strategically to balance growth and risk.

4. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals. Rebalancing your portfolio annually can help maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider working with a financial advisor. They can help you navigate complex tax laws and investment strategies.

Remember, thereâ€™s no one-size-fits-all approach, so consider your unique circumstances when distributing your money.
