When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic approaches to maximize your investment growth and tax efficiency:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Retirement Goals:** Determine how soon you plan to retire and your target retirement income.
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Understand your comfort level with risk, which may influence your investment choices.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** 
     - Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
     - Consider maximizing contributions if your employer offers a Roth option, which provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA Contributions:**
     - If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Use these for investments that may produce dividends or capital gains to strategically manage tax impacts.

### 3. **Diversify Investments Among Accounts**
   - **Asset Allocation:**
     - In tax-advantaged accounts, invest in higher-growth assets (like stocks) due to their long-term compounding potential.
     - In taxable accounts, consider holding more income-producing assets (such as bonds and dividend-yielding stocks) and tax-efficient investments.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - **Monitor Performance:** Regularly review the performance of your accounts to ensure they align with your goals.
   - **Adjust Asset Allocation:** Make adjustments as needed to maintain your desired level of risk and return across different accounts.

### 5. **Consider Professional Advice**
   - If you're unsure about your strategy or need personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored guidance.

By carefully considering these factors and regularly assessing your financial situation, you can optimize how you distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for better long-term growth.
