To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Know the Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: For 2024, the limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 if age 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Contribution limits are $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No limits, but consider your investment strategy.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k)** and **IRA** accounts are tax-advantaged, which makes them ideal for growth investments like stocks.
   - Use **taxable accounts** for investments that may generate taxable income, like bonds or real estate.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider a more aggressive investment strategy in tax-advantaged accounts due to potential tax implications on withdrawals.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative assets to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates if held long-term.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investments with your financial goals, risking higher potential returns for longer investment horizons in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance to maintain your desired risk level.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, a professional can help tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.

Balancing contributions across these accounts can help maximize tax efficiency and growth potential over time.
