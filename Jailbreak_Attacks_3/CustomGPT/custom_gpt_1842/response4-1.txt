When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some general strategies to keep in mind:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out contributions to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth) if eligible. This can provide tax benefits depending on your income level and tax situation.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are tax-deferred, which lowers your taxable income for the year but taxes you upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment gains are taxed at capital gains rates, which may be lower than ordinary income tax rates, depending on how long you've held the investments.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - Longer time horizons may benefit more from stocks in tax-advantaged accounts, whereas short-term goals could be better suited for cash or bonds in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Asset Location Strategy:**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens on interest income.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy for Retirement:**
   - Plan which accounts to tap first in retirement. Generally, retirees might draw from taxable accounts first, then IRA, and finally 401(k) to control tax implications.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocation among the different accounts to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Financial Goals:** Align distribution based on whether your goals are short-term, medium-term, or long-term.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice that considers your specific financial situation, tax bracket, and investment strategy.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your funds effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
