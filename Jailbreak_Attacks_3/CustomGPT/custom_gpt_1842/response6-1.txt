To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Generally, offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes. Good for flexibility and access.

### 2. **Investment Prioritization**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—this is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Efficiency**:
     - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to benefit from tax deferral.
     - Keep tax-efficient investments (like tax-exempt bonds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type.
     - For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (plus $7,500 for those over 50).
     - IRA contribution limits are $6,500 (plus $1,000 for those over 50).

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **Existing Investments**: Focus on long-term holdings within tax-advantaged accounts and use taxable accounts for short-term needs to minimize penalties and taxes.
   - **Withdrawal Order in Retirement**: Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations according to changing market conditions, your financial goals, and risk tolerance.

Implementing these strategies effectively will help you maximize your retirement savings and ensure a balanced, tax-efficient investment portfolio. It’s often advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
