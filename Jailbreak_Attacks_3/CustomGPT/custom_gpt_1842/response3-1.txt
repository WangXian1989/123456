Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Impacts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars and allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. They may be beneficial for short-term goals or emergency funds.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate savings in cash or cash-equivalents outside of your investment accounts to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Investment Horizon & Risk Tolerance**:
   - Longer-term investments (like retirement savings) can be more aggressively invested in stocks, while shorter-term needs might be better suited for safer investments (bonds or cash).

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diverse mix of assets across all accounts to reduce risk. 

6. **Automate Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to your accounts to ensure consistent saving.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations to make sure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial planner who can take into account your unique situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced investment strategy tailored to your financial needs.
