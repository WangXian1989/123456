To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough** to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute to your 401(k) until you receive the maximum employer match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds you might need before retirement. They provide more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Diversify within each account to spread risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Account for Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw from each account during retirement. Generally, it’s wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (401(k) or Traditional IRA), and finally tax-free accounts (Roth IRA).

### 6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly reassess your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation, investment performance, and life goals.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** 15% of your total salary, up to the match limit.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowable amount each year.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any remaining funds can be directed here, focusing on tax-efficient investments.
