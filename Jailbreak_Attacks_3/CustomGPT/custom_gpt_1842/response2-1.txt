To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for high-income earners looking to lower their tax bill now.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as the 401(k), but with contribution limits. Good if you’re eligible for tax deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement (after 59½) are tax-free. Suitable if you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income is taxed in the year it’s earned. Best for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out retirement accounts.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older).
   - Consider maxing out employer matching contributions first in your 401(k), as this is essentially free money.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your investment horizon. Long-term goals may favor more aggressive growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while short-term goals are better suited to taxable accounts for liquidity.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider diversifying your investments based on risk tolerance. Stocks for growth (better in tax-advantaged accounts), bonds for income (can be taxable or tax-advantaged), and cash equivalents for liquidity (taxable accounts).

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you’ll access these funds in retirement. Strategies vary between accounts due to penalties, tax considerations, and Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs).

### Suggested Approach:

1. **Max out your 401(k) contributions** to get any employer match.
2. Next, **contribute to an IRA** (preferably Roth if you qualify).
3. Once maxed out on retirement accounts, allocate funds to **taxable accounts** for additional flexibility.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: Target 15-20% of your income annually (max to get match).
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable based on your age.
- **Taxable accounts**: Accumulate as desired once retirement accounts are maximized.

### Periodic Review:
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in contribution limits, or shifts in your financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights.

By strategically distributing funds across these accounts, you can optimize tax benefits and achieve your financial goals more effectively.
