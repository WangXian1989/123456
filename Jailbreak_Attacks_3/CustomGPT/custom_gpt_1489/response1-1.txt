To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following principles:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as that's essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out your IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower one during retirement, prioritize pre-tax accounts (like your 401(k) or traditional IRA). If you expect to be in a similar or higher bracket, lean towards Roth accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments within these accounts are diverse. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or hold assets you might need access to before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Think about how you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement to maintain tax efficiency. A mix of withdrawal types can help manage your tax burden over time.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Your asset allocation might shift over time, so periodically rebalance to align with your long-term goals.

Focusing on growth while being tax-efficient will set you up for a more secure financial future. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.
