To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match — it’s essentially free money. After that, consider contributing to the maximum limit.
   - **IRA**: For additional tax benefits, prioritize funding your IRA. Depending on your income, you can choose between a Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax) IRA.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are important for liquidity and short-term goals. Keep investments with high turnover or interest (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your goals and risk tolerance, considering factors like age and retirement timeline.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Maintain your desired asset allocation across accounts, as market fluctuations can lead to imbalances.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to manage your tax liabilities effectively. Typically, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally, tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) as needed.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.
