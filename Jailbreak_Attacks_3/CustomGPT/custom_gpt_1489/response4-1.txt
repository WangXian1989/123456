To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

2. **Balance Your Contributions**:
   - After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any additional savings to a taxable account. This can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and also diversifies your investment.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term growth, consider putting more into equities within your 401(k) and IRA. For shorter-term goals, use your taxable accounts to invest in less volatile assets.

4. **Understand Capital Gains**:
   - Investing in tax-efficient funds within taxable accounts can help minimize taxes on capital gains. 

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Check your asset allocation annually and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

6. **Tax Implications**:
   - Withdrawals from traditional accounts will be taxed as income, while qualified distributions from Roth accounts are tax-free. Plan your withdrawals accordingly during retirement to optimize your tax situation.

Overall, your individual circumstances—like income level, tax bracket, and financial goals—will dictate the best approach, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
