Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here’s a wise approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** 
   - Start with your 401(k) and contribute enough to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money.
   - Shortly after, focus on your IRA (Traditional or Roth). If you qualify for a Roth IRA, contribute to that first, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.
   
2. **Understand Contribution Limits:** 
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, for example, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 if you're under 50, and $30,500 if you're 50 or older. The IRA limit is $6,500, or $7,500 for those 50 and above.

3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt:** 
   - Before heavy contributions, ensure any high-interest debts (like credit cards) are handled. It can offer better returns than investments.

4. **Consider Investment Options and Fees:**
   - Compare the investment options available in your 401(k) with those in your IRA and taxable account. Some 401(k) plans may offer limited or high-fee choices.

5. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Taxable accounts allow for more flexibility and have different tax implications, especially concerning capital gains. Consider using taxable accounts for investments that may generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends.

6. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:** 
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance. It’s vital to think about the mix of stocks, bonds, and cash across all your accounts.

7. **Adjust Based on Life Stage:**
   - Younger investors might lean more towards growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while near-retirement individuals might shift to more conservative investments.

8. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Review your allocations regularly and rebalance as needed based on performance and changing life circumstances.

9. **Consider Professional Advice:**
   - Consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies can help optimize your distribution based on your situation.

By strategically allocating your investments among these accounts, you can effectively build wealth over time while managing your tax burden.
