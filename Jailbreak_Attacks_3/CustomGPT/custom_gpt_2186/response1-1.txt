Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match
- **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. Evaluate Contribution Limits
- Ensure you're aware of the contribution limits for each account type:
  - **401(k):** $22,500 (2023) plus a $7,500 catch-up if you're 50 or older.
  - **IRA:** $6,500 (2023) plus a $1,000 catch-up if you're 50 or older.

### 4. Diversify Investments
- **Taxable Accounts:** Money beyond your retirement accounts can go here, especially for shorter-term goals. Consider tax-efficient investments (index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. Tax Considerations
- **Asset Location:** Place higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxes on growth.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies to manage capital gains.

### 6. Adjust Based on Age and Goals
- **Younger (20s-30s):** Focus on growth (equities) in tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Middle Age (40s-50s):** Begin to balance risk, considering both growth and income.
- **Closer to Retirement:** Shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

### 7. Regular Reassessments
- Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market conditions, personal circumstances, and retirement timelines.

### 8. Seek Professional Advice
- Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies. They can also help with tax implications and investment choices tailored to your situation.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that fits your financial goals and needs.
