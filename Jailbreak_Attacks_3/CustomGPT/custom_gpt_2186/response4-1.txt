Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and current circumstances. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Determine Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings**: Focus more on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on eligibility, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax deferral.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for investments that generate capital gains and qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 4. **Consider Investment Options**
   - **401(k)**: Limited investment choices based on the plan.
   - **IRA**: Broader investment options, including stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds.

### 5. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - Ensure that your portfolio is diversified across asset classes and investment vehicles to mitigate risk.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation to align with changing goals, market conditions, and life events.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
- Initially, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) for any match.
- Next, max out your IRA contributions if eligible.
- Finally, allocate any additional funds to your taxable accounts.
