Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations to help you decide:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Short-term needs**: Use a taxable account for liquidity.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions often reduce taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments may incur capital gains taxes; long-term holdings can benefit from lower rates.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: Check annual limits; employer matching should be maximized.
   - **IRA**: Consider whether to use a Traditional or Roth IRA, based on income limits and tax preferences.

### 4. **Investment Options**
   - Use the 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth, investing in diversified funds or stocks.
   - In taxable accounts, consider investments that minimize taxes, like index funds.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is properly diversified across asset classes.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund, ideally covering 3-6 months of expenses.

### 7. **Regular Review**
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and adjust based on life changes or market conditions.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Maximize 401(k) contributions** to receive any employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** to benefit from tax advantages.
3. **Invest remaining funds in a taxable account** as needed for liquidity or specific short-term goals.

### Conclusion
Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation and ensures compliance with tax laws.
