Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if availableâ€”this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs grow tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you qualify for a Roth, it can be beneficial for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be accessed without penalty and may offer more flexibility for short-term needs, but capital gains taxes apply when investments are sold.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund set aside before heavily investing.

4. **Debt Considerations**: Pay off high-interest debts first as they can negate the benefits of investment growth.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Keep more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.
   - Utilize tax-advantaged accounts for higher growth investments.

6. **Diversify**: Make sure you're diversifying across asset classes and tax treatments to minimize risk.

7. **Reassess Periodically**: Regularly review your asset allocation to make adjustments based on market conditions and life changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
