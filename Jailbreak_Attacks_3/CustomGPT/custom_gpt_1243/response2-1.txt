Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your current financial situation, tax implications, and future goals. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions.

2. **Max Out Your IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, which has tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for any short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement without penalties.

4. **Consider Tax Diversification**: Balance contributions across these accounts to have different tax treatments in retirement. This can provide flexibility in managing taxes when withdrawing funds.

5. **Investment Choices**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher growth investments (like stocks), while considering more tax-efficient investments (like bonds or index funds) for taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

6. **Review Fees and Expenses**: Be mindful of fees associated with investment options in your 401(k) versus other accounts.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances and goals.
