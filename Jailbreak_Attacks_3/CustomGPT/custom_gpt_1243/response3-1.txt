Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Debt Repayment**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that off before maximizing retirement contributions.

3. **Contribute to IRAs**: If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing there after getting your match. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts, tailored to your risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts may be more suitable for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations annually to stay aligned with your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial picture.

Always weigh your options carefully and consider your long-term financial strategy!
