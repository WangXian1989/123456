Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a basic framework to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's essentially free money).
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now. 

2. **Traditional IRA**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Similar to a 401(k), but with potentially more investment options.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for IRAs.

3. **Roth IRA**:
   - **Tax-Free Growth**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Flexibility**: Can be a good choice if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: Great for investments you may need access to before retirement.
   - **Investments**: Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. Max out your 401(k) contributions to get the employer match.
2. Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify (or a traditional IRA based on your tax situation).
3. Invest any additional savings in a taxable account, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Monitor and Adjust:
- Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
- Tailor your strategy to your unique situation with professional advice.

This balance will allow you to optimize tax benefits while maintaining liquidity and flexibility in your investments.
