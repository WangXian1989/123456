To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following principles:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income now. Consider maxing this out if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions now, taxed later) or a Roth IRA (contributions taxed now, withdrawals tax-free during retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income, like stocks or mutual funds, or for savings you might need before retirement.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on growth-oriented investments within your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) since they can grow tax-deferred.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize yearly tax exposure.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. This mitigates risk and balances returns.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain cash reserves in a taxable account for quick access to funds without penalties.

6. **Rebalance Annually**: Review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals or risk tolerance.
