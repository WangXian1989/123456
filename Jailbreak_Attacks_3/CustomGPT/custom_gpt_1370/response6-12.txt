I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for the best treatment options for liver issues. Treatment often depends on the specific condition affecting your liver, but common approaches may include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the diagnosis (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), there may be specific medications that can help manage the condition.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and abstaining from alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups to monitor liver function and catch any potential complications early.

4. **Surgery**: In some cases, procedures may be necessary, such as for liver tumors or severe liver disease.

Please reach out to a healthcare provider to get tailored advice for your situation.
