The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**:
   - If your 401(k) offers employer matching contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Keep tax brackets in mind. Early withdrawals can incur penalties and taxes.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax treatment. A traditional IRA may offer tax deductions, while a Roth IRA grows tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, which can impact your net returns.

3. **Diversify Across Accounts**:
   - Invest for tax efficiency: Place high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize tax on capital gains. Use taxable accounts for more stable investments that generate regular income (like bonds) to manage tax liabilities.

4. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize your contributions effectively.

5. **Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), lean more heavily into tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, prioritize liquidity, which may mean more funds in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - As your investments grow, periodically reassess and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation and goals.

Evaluating these factors will help optimize your distribution of funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
