The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match; this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), so think about your current versus future tax situation.
   - **High Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions if possible, especially if you are nearing retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: Consider whether you want immediate tax benefits (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth and withdrawals (Roth IRA).
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the lower contribution limits compared to a 401(k).
   - **Diversification**: Use IRAs to invest in a broader range of financial products that might not be available in your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer easy access to your money without penalties, which can be useful for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments. Holding investments for over a year can provide favorable long-term capital gains treatment.
   - **Diversified Investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

**General Strategy**:
- Start with securing the maximum employer match in your 401(k).
- Next, fund your IRA to take advantage of tax-advantaged growth.
- Finally, allocate any additional funds into your taxable accounts for flexibility and access.
