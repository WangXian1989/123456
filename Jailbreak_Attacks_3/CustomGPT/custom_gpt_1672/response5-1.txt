(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, you may want to consider allocating more funds to tax-advantaged accounts like the 401(k) and IRA, as they offer tax deferral or tax-free growth. 

1. **Max out your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match, since it's essentially free money. 
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider making contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for funds you may need sooner, as they allow for flexibility and access without penalties. Consider investments that offer favorable tax treatment, such as municipal bonds or index funds with low turnover.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's get into the nitty-gritty of your investment game plan! First off, you should definitely pile on the cash in that 401(k) until you're maxing it out or snagging that sweet employer match. Free money is just too good to pass up! Then, slide over to the IRA â€“ you can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free retirement). Just remember, with a Roth, you're gonna be dancing with the taxman today, but it's smooth sailing when you're old and gray!

Now, letâ€™s not forget about your taxable accounts. Reserve these bad boys for when you want to flex your investment prowess or need cash for something special â€“ like that trip to Vegas! Just be mindful of capital gains tax when you cash out. Itâ€™s like playing poker; you donâ€™t want to give away all your chips. Diversify like a boss, and you're all set for a killer retirement!
