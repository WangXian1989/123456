When considering how to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to understand the purpose of each account type and your financial goals. Here's a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - Next, consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) if you are in a high tax bracket, as it reduces your taxable income.
   - Keep in mind the investment options available in your 401(k) and ensure they align with your overall investment strategy.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - After maximizing your employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.
     - A **traditional IRA** may be beneficial for tax deductions in the present.
     - A **Roth IRA** allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later on.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Funds in taxable accounts are more accessible and provide flexibility for short-term goals. 
   - These accounts are ideal for investments in funds or stocks that generate lower capital gains or those that may be held long-term to take advantage of the lower long-term capital gains tax rate.
   - Consider using taxable accounts for investments that are not suitable for tax-advantaged accounts, such as certain types of bonds or short-term savings.

**Allocation Strategy**:
- Start with the employer match in the 401(k), then contribute to your IRA.
- After reaching your IRA contribution limits, return to maxing out your 401(k), and then consider any additional investments in taxable accounts.
- Continuously assess your goals, expenses, and expected retirement timeline to adjust your contributions accordingly. 

**Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
- It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor who can consider your specific financial situation and tailor advice to your needs.

Remember that personal circumstances can vary greatly, so what works best depends on your unique financial situation and goals.
