I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. The best treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition diagnosed and its severity. Some common approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and abstaining from alcohol can greatly enhance liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the ailment, medications like antiviral drugs for hepatitis or medications to manage symptoms such as itching or inflammation may be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Blood tests and imaging studies may be required to monitor the liver's health and detect any changes early.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options like liver transplantation may be considered.

However, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.
