To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and the investment options available in each account. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), start by contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money. 

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar tax advantages as a 401(k) for contributions, but with potential income limits. Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These don't offer the same tax benefits, but they allow more flexibility for withdrawals. You'll be taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

3. **Diversification:** Ensure that your investment choices across all accounts are diversified to reduce risk. This includes a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) suited to your risk tolerance.

4. **Investment Horizon:** Your age and how far you are from retirement will influence how aggressive or conservative your investments should be. Younger investors typically can afford to take on more risk, while those nearing retirement should focus on preservation of capital.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Monitor your investments periodically and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. 

6. **Tax-Efficient Investing:** Place your investments in tax-advantaged accounts based on their tax efficiency. For instance, high-growth stocks can be placed in a Roth IRA to avoid capital gains taxes, while bonds (which generate interest) might be better in a tax-deferred account.

7. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:** As you approach retirement, think about how you’ll withdraw funds. This is crucial for tax efficiency and ensuring your money lasts throughout retirement.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Given the complexities of tax laws and investment strategies, speak with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your financial situation and goals.

Each individual’s situation is unique, so it’s essential to develop a strategy that aligns with your personal financial situation and long-term goals.
