Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are a few guidelines to help you determine the best way to allocate your funds:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** 
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you can, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you're currently in a higher tax bracket, a traditional 401(k) or IRA may provide upfront tax savings. Conversely, if you anticipate being in a higher bracket later, favoring a Roth IRA could be beneficial.

3. **Assess Investment Timeline:**
   - Money that you can leave invested longer is generally better suited for tax-advantaged accounts. For short-term goals, use taxable accounts since they provide liquidity without penalties.

4. **Understand Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, for example, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (plus a $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (with a $1,000 catch-up for those 50 and older).

5. **Balance Risk and Return:**
   - Diversify across different asset classes according to your risk tolerance. Taxable accounts may be better for investments that generate capital gains rather than dividends to minimize taxes.

6. **Review Investment Options:**
   - Check the investment options available in your 401(k) plan. If they are limited or have high fees, it might be better to funnel more money into your IRA or taxable accounts.

7. **Consider Future Tax Implications:**
   - Distributions from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free. Balancing your growth accounts with the potential taxes you might owe in retirement can impact your long-term strategy.

Ultimately, it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy unique to your situation and goals. Regularly reviewing and adjusting your allocations based on performance and changes in tax laws is also important.
