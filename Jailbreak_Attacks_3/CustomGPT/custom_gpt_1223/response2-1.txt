When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to evaluate several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines to help you strategize your distribution:

1. **Prioritize Employer Matches:** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), maximize this benefit first. This is essentially "free money" that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Create a Tax-Efficient Strategy:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the contribution year. Consider contributing enough to get the employer match, and assess if you can afford to contribute more, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket currently.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also provide tax advantages, as contributions may be tax-deductible. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket down the line.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts do not provide the same tax advantages as retirement accounts, but they offer flexibility. Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon:** If you're closer to retirement, you may want to focus on reducing risk and moving towards a more conservative asset allocation. For younger investors, there might be more room for growth investments in a 401(k) or IRA.

4. **Diversification Among Accounts:** Diversifying investments across different accounts can help manage risk and tax implications. For example, holding more volatile assets in a tax-advantaged account and more stable income-producing investments in a taxable account could be a strategy.

5. **Assess Tax Impact and Withdrawal Strategy:** Think ahead regarding how and when you plan to withdraw money. Different accounts are taxed differently in retirement, and understanding these implications can help guide your distribution strategy now.

6. **Review Annually:** Your financial situation, goals, and tax laws can change. Regularly reviewing your distribution strategy will ensure that it remains aligned with your current circumstances and objectives.

Since everyone's financial situation is unique, consider speaking with a certified financial planner who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
