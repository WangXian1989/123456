To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions may be pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth). Evaluate your current and expected future tax brackets. A pre-tax contribution could lower your taxable income now, while a Roth contribution might be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket upon retirement.
   - **IRA:** Similarly to the 401(k), assess your tax situation. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth but tax when withdrawn; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings from taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax. Long-term investments are generally taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains.

2. **Investment Objectives:**
   - **401(k):** Generally suitable for long-term growth, often with limited investment options based on your plan's offerings. Prioritize maxing out employer matching contributions.
   - **IRA:** A flexible vehicle; you can invest in various assets like stocks, bonds, or ETFs. Use this account for growth-oriented investments if focusing on future retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for short-/medium-term goals or if you need liquidity. Consider placing assets with lower turnover and tax implications, such as index funds or ETFs.

3. **Diversification Strategies:**
   - Evaluate your investment mix across all accounts. Maintain a balanced portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon, considering asset allocation based on your overall financial plan.
   - Think about tax-efficient investing strategies, such as holding bond funds in tax-deferred accounts and keeping stocks with higher growth potential in your taxable accounts.

4. **Contribution Limits & Adjustments:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s ($22,500 for 2023, with a $7,500 catch-up if over 50) and IRAs ($6,500 with a $1,000 catch-up). Adjust your contributions based on these limits and your financial goals.

5. **Regular Review:**
   - Monitor performance and rebalance your portfolio periodically to adapt to changing market conditions, personal circumstances, and retirement objectives.

In summary, a well-considered distribution across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, informed by tax implications, investment objectives, diversification strategies, contribution limits, and regular reviews, will support your financial growth and retirement goals.
