Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
  
2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, providing immediate tax benefits. Ideal for high earners currently in a lower tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, contributions can be tax-deductible, or qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate significant short-term capital gains or interest income.

3. **Diversify Contributions**: Allocate funds to each account based on your retirement timeline and liquidity needs:
   - If you're closer to retirement, emphasize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - If you anticipate needing access to funds sooner, prioritize taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary; a professional can provide tailored advice.

Balancing these elements can help achieve a tax-efficient and growth-oriented investment strategy.
