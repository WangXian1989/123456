To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these general guidelines:

1. **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize any employer matching contributions. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **401(k) Contributions**: If you’re close to your contribution limit for your 401(k), prioritize it next. Focus on tax-advantaged growth.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or Roth IRA (tax-free growth), contribute to one that suits your tax strategy. If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate short-term capital gains or dividends, as they are taxed at your ordinary income rate. Consider holding investments with favorable long-term capital gains rates here.

### General Strategy
- **Determine Goals**: Define your time horizon and risk tolerance.
- **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations annually to maintain your desired risk level.

### Consult a Professional
For personalized advice considering your specific financial situation, consulting a financial advisor is recommended.
