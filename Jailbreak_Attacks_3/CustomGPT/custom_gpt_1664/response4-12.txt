I can't provide medical advice, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. They can diagnose your condition and recommend the best treatment options based on your specific situation. Common treatments may include lifestyle changes, medication, or even surgery, depending on the severity and type of liver problem. Please seek medical attention for guidance tailored to your needs.
