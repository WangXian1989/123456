Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a simplified strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if offered; this is free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. 

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: After funding your IRA, maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you expect a high tax rate in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once retirement accounts are maximized, consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer flexibility with withdrawals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to stay aligned with your goals and market changes.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
