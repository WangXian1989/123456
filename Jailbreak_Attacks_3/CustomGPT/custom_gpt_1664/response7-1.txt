Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to contribute at least enough to get any employer match.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose a diversified mix, typically including a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial. If you anticipate a higher tax rate, a Roth IRA is advantageous since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Max Contributions**: Contribute the maximum allowed if you can.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-managed funds) to reduce capital gains taxes.

### Distribution Strategy
1. **Prioritize Investments**:
   - Start with employer-match contributions in your 401(k).
   - Then, max out your IRA contributions.
   - Any remaining funds can go into your taxable accounts.

2. **Maintain an Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance and goals, redistributing as needed across all three account types.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Take into account the tax implications of selling assets in taxable accounts, and consider tax-loss harvesting strategies.

### Summary
Your goal should be to balance tax benefits, growth potential, and access to funds. Regularly review your asset allocation to reflect your changing financial situation and market conditions. Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
