Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Consider contributing to an IRA next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Diversify Contributions**
   - **Tax Diversification**: Having a mix of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts can provide flexibility in retirement withdrawals. 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investment growth that benefits from lower capital gains taxes and for funds that you may need before retirement.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you’re in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts. If you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA can be beneficial.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**
   - Always maintain a cash reserve for emergencies within your taxable accounts.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**
   - Younger investors may lean more heavily into stocks for growth; older investors might prefer bonds and safer assets to preserve capital.

### 6. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider personalized advice based on your specific circumstances, especially for optimizing taxes and investment strategies.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of salary (enough to max out any employer match)
- **IRA**: $6,500 (for 2023) if eligible
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining funds after leveraging tax-advantaged options

This structure helps you build wealth efficiently while managing tax implications.
