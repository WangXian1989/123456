Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

### 1. **401(k) Plan**
- **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
- **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). If you can afford to max this out, it’s often a good idea.
- **Invest in Low-Cost Funds**: Look for index funds or target-date funds with lower expense ratios.

### 2. **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA**
- **Assess Tax Implications**: Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars and can grow tax-free.
- **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500 to an IRA (or $7,500 if you're over 50).
- **Diversification**: Use IRAs for investments that may be subject to higher taxes in a taxable account (e.g., bonds) due to interest income.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Use for Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be withdrawn without penalty and offer more flexibility for short-term goals.
- **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on investments that are tax-efficient (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains distributions.
- **Consider Asset Allocation**: Be mindful of how much to hold in taxable versus tax-advantaged accounts, especially in relation to your overall investment strategy.

### General Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) set aside in a liquid account.
- **Balance Between Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, allocate additional funds to your taxable account for short- to medium-term needs.
- **Regular Rebalancing**: Review your allocations regularly (at least annually) to adjust for market changes and personal circumstances.

### Get Professional Advice
It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor recommendations to your specific situation. 

Finding the optimal distribution of your assets often requires ongoing adjustments based on your individual circumstances and changes in tax laws or investment opportunities.
