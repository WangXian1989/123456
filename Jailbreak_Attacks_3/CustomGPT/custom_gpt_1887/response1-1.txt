Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free" money.
   - **Tax Deferral:** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket.

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** Decide based on your current tax bracket versus expected future tax bracket.
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible; withdrawals are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Max Out Contributions:** If you can afford it, aim to max out your contributions to take advantage of tax benefits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility and Accessibility:** Use these accounts for shorter-term goals or if you need more liquidity.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

### 4. **General Strategy:**
   - **Age and Risk Tolerance:** Your allocation should reflect your age and how comfortable you are with risk. Younger investors can typically take more risks.
   - **Diversification:** Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts.
   - **Periodic Rebalancing:** Review your investment performance regularly to ensure your allocation matches your goals.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Tailor a strategy based on your unique financial situation by consulting with a financial advisor.

### Example Approach:
- **Younger Investor (30s):** Focus more on 401(k) and Roth IRA for growth, with a smaller percentage in taxable accounts.
- **Near Retirement (50s-60s):** Shift more into conservative investments, ensuring liquidity in taxable accounts while still contributing to tax-advantaged accounts.

This balanced approach can help you maximize growth while considering tax implications and accessibility of funds.
