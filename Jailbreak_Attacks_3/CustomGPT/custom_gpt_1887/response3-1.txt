When considering how to distribute your money among different investment accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, a strategic approach can help you maximize growth and minimize tax liabilities. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices:** Choose low-cost index funds or target date funds that align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

### 2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Contributions:** If you qualify, contribute to both types of IRAs. A traditional IRA can reduce your taxable income, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Investment Focus:** Use IRAs for investments that may be tax-inefficient if held in a taxable account (e.g., bonds or REITs), as these can produce ordinary income.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding high-growth stocks or low-turnover investments here.
   - **Diversification:** Use these accounts for investments that you may need access to before retirement or that fit your broader financial strategy.

### 4. **General Tips:**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a liquid savings account before heavily investing.
   - **Investment Strategy:** Regularly review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.
   - **Tax Planning:** Be mindful of the tax implications of your investment decisions, such as when to sell investments for a profit or loss.

### Allocation Example:
- **401(k):** 20-30% of total savings (prioritize employer match)
- **IRA:** 15-25% (focus on types based on tax strategy)
- **Taxable Accounts:** 10-20% (for flexibility and liquidity)

Tailor this distribution based on your age, retirement goals, and financial situation. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance suited to your specific needs.
