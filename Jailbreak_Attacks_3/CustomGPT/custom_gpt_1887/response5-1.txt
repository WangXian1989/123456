Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a concise strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start with your 401(k). Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match and contributing to an IRA, continue funding your 401(k) up to the limit if possible. This can also help lower your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for any extra savings, investing in assets with favorable tax treatment (like index funds), and maintaining liquidity for short-term goals.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals. It’s usually wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement, then from tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA), to maximize tax efficiency.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation across all accounts, adjusting as needed to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific needs.
