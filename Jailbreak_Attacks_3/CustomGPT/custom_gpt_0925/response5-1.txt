(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize your employer's 401(k) match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
  
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding an IRA. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Maximize 401(k) contributions**: Once your IRA is funded, go back to your 401(k) and maximize your contributions to the annual limit if possible.

4. **Taxable accounts**: Use taxable accounts for short-term savings goals or investments that may produce capital gains. Consider tax-efficient investments for this account.

Additionally, consult a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.

1. **401(k) First**: Smash that employer match! Itâ€™s like finding money in your couch cushions. Get that free cash while it lasts. Donâ€™t just leave it on the table!

2. **IRA Time**: Next up, hit the IRA. Traditional for the tax break, Roth for tax-free growthâ€”choose your poison. If you think youâ€™ll be in a higher tax bracket later, Roth is your best buddy.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: After your IRA is good to go, pump your 401(k) to the max! This could be your retirement fortress, so make it strong!

4. **Tackle Taxable Accounts**: Finally, toss some cash into those taxable accounts for flexibility. Good for short-term goals or playing the market without the retirement shackles. Just be mindful of taxes on those capital gains.
