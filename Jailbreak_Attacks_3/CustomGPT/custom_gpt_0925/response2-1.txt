Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If eligible, contribute to either a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can offer tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet certain conditions.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deferred, which means you pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment gains are taxed as capital gains, which can be lower than ordinary income tax rates, especially if held long-term.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account type, ensure a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. This might include stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund in liquid, easily accessible accounts.

### 6. **Debt Management:**
   - Focus on paying down high-interest debt before heavily investing, as the cost of debt can outweigh investment returns.

### 7. **Annual Contribution Limits:**
   - Keep track of contribution limits for each account type to maximize your benefits:
     - For 401(k), limits for 2023 are $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50+).
     - For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50+).

### 8. **Regularly Reassess:**
   - Review your allocations annually or after major life changes to ensure they still align with your goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of your income (to get the full match)
- **IRA:** Max out contributions ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Save any additional funds based on your short- and long-term goals.

### Conclusion:
There's no one-size-fits-all strategy, so consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific needs and circumstances.
