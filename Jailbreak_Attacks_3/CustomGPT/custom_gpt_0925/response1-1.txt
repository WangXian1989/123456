Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose a mix of investments based on your risk tolerance (stocks for growth, bonds for stability).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Consideration**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current tax situation, you might choose one over the other.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: Ensure you’re maximizing your contributions to take advantage of tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these accounts for short-term needs or specific goals (like buying a house). 
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding investments that generate lower taxes, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Strategy Tips:
- **Diversification**: Keep a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.
- **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement, considering tax implications to minimize tax burden.

### Consider Professional Help:
- Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can help align your investment strategy with your individual circumstances.

This approach seeks to balance tax efficiency and flexibility for both short-term and long-term financial goals.
