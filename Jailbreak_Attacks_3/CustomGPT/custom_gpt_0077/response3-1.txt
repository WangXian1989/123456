Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower taxable income; good for higher-income years.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for investing in assets that may provide dividends or capital gains, taxed at lower rates.

### 3. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**
   - Maintain an emergency fund in easily accessible accounts before focusing on investing.

### 4. **Target Retirement Accounts First**
   - Prioritize maxing out retirement accounts (401(k) + IRA) before investing excess funds in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a diverse mix of investments within each account type to manage risk.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your investments based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 15% of salary (up to the match)
- **IRA**: $6,500/year (or $7,500 if 50+)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any surplus after maxing retirement options

Customizing the exact percentages will depend on your unique situation and goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
