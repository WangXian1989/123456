To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs and 401(k)s) before allocating funds to taxable accounts. This can help reduce your tax burden.

3. **Diversity in Investments**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment choices, but you can select a mix of stocks, bonds, and target-date funds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Typically offers a wider array of investment options. Consider diversifying across different asset classes.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate taxable income. Strategies like investing in index funds or ETFs can help minimize tax implications.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
   - Traditional 401(k) and IRAs provide tax-deferral but are taxed upon withdrawal. Depending on your current and anticipated future tax rate, you might prioritize Roth options if you're in a lower tax bracket now.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in your taxable accounts for emergencies before heavily investing.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review your allocations to maintain your desired asset allocation and adjust based on market conditions and life changes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial planner.

By focusing on these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to growing your wealth while minimizing tax liabilities.
