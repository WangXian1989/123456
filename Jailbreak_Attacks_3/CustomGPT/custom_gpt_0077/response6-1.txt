To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the contribution limit if possible.
- **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 2. Balance Short and Long-Term Goals
- **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth investments, such as stocks or mutual funds.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use this for short-term goals or more liquid needs; consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. Consider Your Tax Situation
- **Tax Bracket:** If you're in a higher bracket now, prioritize pre-tax accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA). If you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, consider Roth options.
- **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement, balancing distributions from taxable and tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. Diversify Investments
- Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes and within each account type to mitigate risk.

By strategically allocating funds based on these principles, you can optimize your investments for growth and tax efficiency.
