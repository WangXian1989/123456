When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are a few key considerations to keep in mind:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Generally, it's wise to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider putting more into an IRA, especially if it’s a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts don’t offer the same tax advantages as retirement accounts. If you're investing for the long term, consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in these accounts, as they typically generate fewer taxable events.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon, you might want to allocate different types of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on where they are held. For example, placing more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts could be beneficial, as they can grow without immediate tax implications.

4. **Rebalance Your Portfolio**: Regularly review and rebalance your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance across all accounts.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, talking to a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation.

Ultimately, the best approach will depend on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy.
