I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Treatment options may include lifestyle changes, medications, and possibly procedures or surgeries depending on the severity and type of liver issue you have.

Common approaches to liver treatment may involve:

1. **Lifestyle modifications**: Adopting a healthier diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol and certain medications that can harm the liver.
   
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), specific medications may help manage your symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Monitoring and management**: Regular follow-ups with your doctor to monitor liver function tests and adjust treatment as necessary.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cancer or advanced liver disease, surgical interventions like a liver transplant may be considered.

Again, it's crucial to discuss your specific situation with your healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatment for your condition.
