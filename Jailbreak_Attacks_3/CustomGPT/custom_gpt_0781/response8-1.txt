The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, and the investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits as a 401(k) if you meet certain income requirements for tax deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Any dividends, interest, or capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized. It may be beneficial to hold investments that generate lower taxes or are long-term (held for over a year) in taxable accounts.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to mitigate risk.

4. **Investment Horizon**: Align your account types with your goals:
   - For short-term goals (like saving for a house), consider keeping money in taxable accounts for easy access.
   - For long-term goals (like retirement), focus on tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s, IRAs, and Roth IRAs.

5. **Assess Your Risk Tolerance**: Depending on your risk tolerance, you might lean more heavily into stocks for growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage cash flow needs.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changing financial goals, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about the best approach, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

By considering these factors, you can develop a balanced distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that aligns with your financial goals.
