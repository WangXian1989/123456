To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize this to maximize your benefits. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are tax-free upon withdrawal, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50), and for IRAs, it's $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Diversification**:
   - Within your accounts, diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have accessible savings for emergencies in a separate, easily accessible account before heavily funding retirement accounts.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as income. Consider your current and expected future tax rates when planning withdrawals.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider speaking with a financial planner.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money effectively among your accounts.
