Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on a few key factors: your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA (traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged options. This provides flexibility for withdrawals and access to capital.

4. **Investment Selection**: Invest in higher-risk assets in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth. In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations as needed to stay aligned with your goals and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a tailored plan based on your individual situation.
