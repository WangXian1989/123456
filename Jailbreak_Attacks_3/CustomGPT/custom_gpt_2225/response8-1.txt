To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider the traditional or Roth IRA based on your current income and tax situation. Max out contributions if you're eligible.

2. **Consider Taxation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are generally best for investments that generate capital gains, since long-term capital gains are often taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions reduce taxable income now (traditional) or allow for tax-free growth (Roth). Distributions from these accounts will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, ETFs) in each account type to mitigate risk.

4. **Investment Horizon:**
   - Align your investments with your retirement timeline. Longer time horizons can afford more risk in equities, while shorter timelines might lean towards more stable investments.

5. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as required based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Fees and Expenses:**
   - Keep an eye on the fees associated with each account type, as high fees can erode returns over time.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.
