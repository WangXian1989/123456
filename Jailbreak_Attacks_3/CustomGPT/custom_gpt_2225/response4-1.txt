I canâ€™t provide specific financial advice, but I can help you understand some general considerations for distributing money among different investment accounts. Here are a few factors you might consider:

1. **Tax Implications**: 401(k) and IRA contributions often offer tax advantages, such as tax deferral or tax deductions, while taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Investment Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. You might want to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts, which can affect how much you can allocate to these accounts each year.

4. **Investment Options**: Explore the investment options available in each account type. Some accounts may offer better investment choices than others.

5. **Risk Tolerance**: Your risk tolerance may influence how you distribute your investments, potentially impacting how much you allocate to more volatile assets in taxable accounts versus tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Needs**: Consider when you might need to access funds. Taxable accounts provide flexibility, while retirement accounts typically have restrictions on withdrawals.

For personalized strategies, consulting with a financial advisor is often beneficial.
