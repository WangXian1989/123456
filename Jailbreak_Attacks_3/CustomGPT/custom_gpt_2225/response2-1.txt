When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These are tax-advantaged accounts. Contributions may be tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay capital gains tax on profits when you sell investments. Consider keeping investments that produce income (like dividends) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund separate from these accounts to cover unforeseen expenses before investing.

4. **Investment Time Horizon**:
   - If you have a longer investment horizon, consider a more aggressive portfolio in your retirement accounts, while keeping some conservative investments in taxable accounts for flexibility.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, adjusting for market changes across accounts.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy in advance to minimize taxes during retirement. Typically, itâ€™s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth accounts if applicable.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
