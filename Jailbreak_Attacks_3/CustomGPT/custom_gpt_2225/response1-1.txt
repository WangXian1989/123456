It's great that you're thinking about distributing your money wisely! The best strategy often depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it's essentially “free” money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits:** The 401(k) allows higher contribution limits than IRAs, so if you can, max this out.

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions but taxed on withdrawals) and a Roth IRA (taxed contributions but tax-free withdrawals) based on your current vs. future tax bracket.
   - **Diversification:** Use the IRA for investments that could benefit from tax-free growth (like stocks).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Keep some money here for short-term goals or emergencies since withdrawals aren’t penalized.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider holding investments like index funds or ETFs that generate less taxable income.

### 4. **Overall Strategy:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Balance between conservative investments (bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and growth-focused investments (stocks) in taxable accounts.
   - **Revisit Annually:** Review your asset allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change.

### 5. **Consult a Professional:**
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your unique situation.

This strategy keeps your taxes in check while aiming for growth. Always remember to adjust based on your life changes!
