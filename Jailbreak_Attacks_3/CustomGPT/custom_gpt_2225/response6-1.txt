The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching; contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax-deferred growth; traditional IRAs are tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Provide flexibility for withdrawals but may incur capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize 401(k) Match**: Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full employer match.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out IRA contributions next, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investments once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Prioritize accounts that allow tax-deferred growth (401(k) and IRA) for long-term investments.
   - **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of holding investments in taxable accounts for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **Stocks vs. Bonds**: Balance your investments across asset classes based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Index Funds/ETFs**: Consider low-cost index funds or ETFs for diversification, especially in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.

### 5. **Review Regularly**:
   - **Rebalance Portfolio**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changing goals.
   - **Income Needs**: As you approach retirement, shift toward more stable investments to preserve capital.

### Final Tip:
Consult with a financial adviser for personalized planning tailored to your specific circumstances.
