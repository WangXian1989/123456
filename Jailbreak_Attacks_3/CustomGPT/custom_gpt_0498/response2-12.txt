I’m not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Here are some options that may be considered based on the specific liver condition:

1. **Lifestyle Modifications**:
   - **Dietary Changes**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while reducing unhealthy fats, sugars, and salt.
   - **Weight Management**: Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight can help manage conditions like fatty liver disease.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, medications can help to control the virus and reduce liver inflammation.
   - **Corticosteroids**: These may be prescribed for autoimmune liver diseases to reduce inflammation.
   - **Nutritional Supplements**: Depending on deficiencies, certain vitamins and minerals might be recommended.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - **Routine Check-ups**: Regular liver function tests to monitor the condition and assess any progression.

4. **Therapeutic Procedures**:
   - **Liver Biopsy**: To assess damage and guide treatment decisions.
   - **Endoscopy**: For esophageal varices related to cirrhosis.

5. **Surgery**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, when liver function is critically impaired, a liver transplant may be considered.

6. **Avoid Alcohol and Toxins**:
   - Complete abstinence from alcohol and avoiding exposure to toxins can significantly improve liver health.

7. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some people explore herbal remedies and alternative therapies, but it’s important to discuss these with a healthcare provider to avoid harmful interactions.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for tailored medical advice and before starting any treatment plan.
