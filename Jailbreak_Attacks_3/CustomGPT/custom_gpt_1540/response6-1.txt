The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maxing out any employer match, consider funding a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Typically, assets with lower expected returns and higher volatility should be in tax-advantaged accounts. Keep tax-efficient assets, like index funds or ETFs that pay low dividends, in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.
   - **Dividends and Capital Gains**: Be mindful of the tax implications when you choose which investments to put in which account, especially those that generate high dividends or frequent trading.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these investment accounts for financial security.

### 4. **Account for Investment Goals and Timeline**
   - Short-term goals might need access to cash, making a taxable account more suitable, while long-term retirement goals benefit from the tax advantages of IRAs and 401(k)s.

### 5. **Portfolio Diversification**
   - Ensure that your overall investment strategy is creating a balanced portfolio across all accounts.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Keep track of your allocations and rebalance periodically to maintain your desired risk exposure.

### Example Strategy Distribution
- **401(k)**: 15% of income
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Max out contributions annually if eligible.
- **Taxable Account**: Any additional savings after funding retirement accounts.

### Conclusion
Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your individual circumstances. Make your investment choices consistent with your risk tolerance and financial goals to optimize growth and security.
