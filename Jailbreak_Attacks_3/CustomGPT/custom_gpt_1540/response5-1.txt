(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends largely on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After taking advantage of any 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth), depending on your eligibility for tax deductions and your anticipated tax rates in retirement.

3. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: If you're still looking to save more and have additional funds, max out your 401(k) contributions if possible, as it has higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds that are not tax-advantaged might be allocated to taxable accounts. These are beneficial for investments that you might want to access before retirement, as they can provide liquidity without penalties.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of how taxes will affect your withdrawals and how investments are taxed in each account type. Generally, you should prioritize placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

Consulting with a financial planner can provide more personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Just make sure you're not getting squeezed out of those contributions based on your income.

3. **Max Out the 401(k)**: Next up, if you’re feeling generous to your future self, max out that 401(k). The limits are way higher compared to IRAs, so load it up!

4. **Don’t Forget the Taxable Accounts**: Finally, for the extra money that's burning a hole in your pocket—consider a taxable account. These are your playground for liquid cash and investments you wanna cash out on before retirement. Think of it as your “go-to fund” for spontaneous adventures.

5. **Tax Strategy is Key**: Keep an eye on those tax implications! Generally, keep the riskier growth stocks in those tax-advantaged accounts where you can maximize your returns tax-free or tax-deferred. It’s all about strategy, my friend!
