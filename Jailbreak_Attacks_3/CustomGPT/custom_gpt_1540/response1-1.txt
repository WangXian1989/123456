Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, and current financial situation. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match before allocating additional funds elsewhere. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k) plans (plus an additional $7,500 if you’re over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (plus an extra $1,000 if you're 50 and older).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals), your tax strategy may vary. The Roth IRA, for example, allows tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should be used for any investment money you have left over after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits you realize in these accounts.

4. **Invest According to Time Horizon**: Your asset allocation should align with how soon you'll need the funds. The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative you might want to be. 

5. **Diversify Investments**: Whichever account you’re distributing money into, ensure a diversified portfolio balanced between stocks, bonds, and other investment types based on risk tolerance.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Make it a habit to review your asset allocation and rebalance your portfolio periodically, especially after major market movements.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best distribution strategy considering your specific situation, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice.

Make sure to tailor these suggestions to your specific needs and goals for the best results.
