Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines you can follow:

1. **Prioritize Employer Matching in 401(k):**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and offers an immediate return on investment.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Next, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (whether it’s a traditional or Roth IRA). The contribution limits for IRAs are typically lower than for a 401(k), but these accounts offer great tax benefits.
   - If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, it can be advantageous for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Contribute to 401(k):**
   - After securing your employer match, continue contributing maximally to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit. The 401(k) usually allows higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

4. **Consider a Taxable Account Last:**
   - Once you’ve maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting money into a taxable account. While these accounts don’t have the same tax benefits, they offer more flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties.

5. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Evaluate your current and expected future tax brackets to determine the best account options. For instance, if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future, using a Roth IRA could be more beneficial as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

6. **Balance Based on Risk Tolerance and Investment Goals:**
   - Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance across all accounts. Diversification is key to managing risk.

7. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation and to react to changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Ultimately, you might want to consider consulting a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that suits your specific situation.
