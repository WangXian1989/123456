Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider an IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you can benefit from tax-deductible contributions or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, a taxable brokerage account can provide greater flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment strategy. 

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and bonds or high-turnover assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your allocation strategy should evolve based on changes in your income, goals, tax situation, and market conditions.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your individual needs.
