Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. Assess Your Tax Situation
- **401(k) Contributions**: Generally, contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income.
- **IRA Options**: A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxable in the year they accrue, so consider capital gains taxes.

### 2. Determine Your Retirement Goals
- **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for liquidity.
- **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings.

### 3. Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contribution.
- **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax advantages. Aim for the maximum allowed contribution.
- **Taxable Account Investments**: Allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts for flexibility and access.

### 4. Regular Review and Adjust
- Periodically review your asset allocation and re-balance to ensure it aligns with your evolving financial goals.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment across accounts for both growth and tax efficiency.
