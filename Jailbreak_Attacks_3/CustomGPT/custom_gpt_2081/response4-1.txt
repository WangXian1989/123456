Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Taxes on capital gains and dividends are due in the year they’re realized, so use these accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Invest in a mix of stocks and bonds based on your age and risk tolerance, often determined by your plan’s options.
   - **IRA**: Similar strategy as your 401(k), potentially with more investment choices.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax implications.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your overall investment portfolio, across all accounts, is diversified to manage risk effectively.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw funds later in life. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, to manage your tax liability effectively.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Revisit your allocations annually or after major life changes to ensure they align with your goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
