1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver function.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can alleviate liver strain.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies help monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical interventions might be necessary, such as a liver transplant.

Always discuss any treatment options with a healthcare provider to determine the best plan for you.
