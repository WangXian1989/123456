When it comes to distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it boils down to a few key factors: your current tax situation, retirement goals, and when you plan to access the funds. Here's a way to think about it:

1. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money! Aim to maximize contributions if your income allows it. The tax deferral on a 401(k) means you won’t pay taxes on that money until you withdraw it in retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you can, put money into a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs let you withdraw tax-free in retirement. If you qualify, go for the Roth—it can be a game-changer for tax-free withdrawals in your golden years.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out retirement accounts, consider putting extra money into a taxable account. These accounts allow for more flexibility since you can access the funds without penalties, unlike retirement accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes; long-term investments usually have favorable tax treatment.

4. **Balance Your Investments**: Diversify your investment options in each account according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Higher risk investments might be better suited for retirement accounts where you won't touch the money for years, while more conservative investments can go into taxable accounts.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Check your distribution plan regularly. Life changes, tax laws, and your financial situation can all affect the best strategy for you, so keep your options open and adjust as needed.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a plan specific to your circumstances. Happy investing!
