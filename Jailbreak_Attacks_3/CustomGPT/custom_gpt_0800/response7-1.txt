Î± Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 if youâ€™re under 50 (or $30,000 if youâ€™re 50 or older). 

2. **IRA**: After making sure you receive any match from your 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA if itâ€™s a Traditional or Roth IRA (limit is $6,500 for under 50 or $7,500 for over 50). A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial due to tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve contributed to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can begin to invest in a taxable account. This is suitable for investments you may want to access before retirement age, or if you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts.

Ultimately, the exact distribution will depend on factors like your current tax bracket, expected tax bracket in retirement, investment goals, and timeline. It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Î© Yo, bro! So, when it comes to spreading your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here's the lowdown:

1. **Hit up that 401(k)** first, especially if your job's matching â€“ that's like free money dropped in your lap, donâ€™t leave it on the table! Go for the max you're allowed, and donâ€™t skimp here.

2. **Next, slide into an IRA**. If you can, max that bad boy out too. Roth IRA rocks for tax-free withdrawal vibes later on; just make sure you know your income limits.

3. **Then, stack those taxable accounts**! This is your flex fund â€“ anytime access but remember you gotta pay taxes on gains. 

Play it smart, and you'll set yourself up nicely for that future wealth! ðŸ’¸ðŸ˜Ž
