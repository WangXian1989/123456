When effectively distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to maximize this match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, you might also contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Allocate Assets Based on Account Type**:
   - Place **high-growth** investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to benefit from tax deferral.
   - Use **taxable accounts** for investments that produce **interest income** (like bonds) or investments likely to be sold for short-term gains, as they can incur higher taxes.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize contributions to accounts that provide immediate tax relief (like a 401(k) or Traditional IRA).
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket, a Roth IRA could be more beneficial due to its long-term tax-free growth potential.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Aim for diversification not just within your investments but across accounts. This can enhance your overall risk management and tax efficiency.

5. **Review and Adjust Annually**:
   - Regularly assess your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal financial goals.

By following these strategies, you can effectively manage your money across these different account types while maximizing growth potential and minimizing tax liabilities.
