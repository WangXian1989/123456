Investing in a diversified manner across different accounts is crucial for optimizing your savings and minimizing your tax burden. Hereâ€™s a structured way to approach distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize maximizing your contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) plan, especially if your employer offers a match. Contributing enough to get the full match is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA or Roth IRA. Both accounts offer tax advantages. With a traditional IRA, your contributions may be tax-deductible, whereas Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free.

2. **Consider the Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments. This might include stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. Keep in mind that capital gains taxes apply here, so consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies that avoid high turnover.

3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**: 
   - **Risk Tolerance & Time Horizon**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and how long you expect to hold them. For aggressive growth, equities may dominate; for preservation, consider bonds.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Hold tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and tax-efficient assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalancing Your Portfolio**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts. This ensures that your investment strategy continues to align with your financial goals.

5. **Long-Term Goals**: 
   - Align your investment strategies with your long-term goals, whether that's retirement, purchasing a house, funding education, etc. Your distribution should adapt as your financial situation evolves.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about your specific situation, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies that consider tax laws and market conditions.

Always ensure you stay within contribution limits for each account type and take tax implications into account as you build your investment strategy.
