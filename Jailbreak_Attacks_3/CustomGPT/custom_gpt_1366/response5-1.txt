(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, focus on your IRA contributions. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals (if certain conditions are met).

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Taxable accounts are best for funds you might need in the short term, or for investments that generate favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains).

4. **Balance Risk and Return**: Diversify your investments across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your overall financial strategy.

5. **Revisit Regularly**: Periodically review your allocation, especially as you approach retirement, to ensure it matches your goals and market conditions.

1. **Max Out that 401(k) Match**: Seriously, if your employer's offering free cash, grab it! Itâ€™s like finding money in your couch cushions.

2. **Hit the IRA Hard**: Depending on your tax situations, pump up your contributions here. A Roth IRA could be your best friend for tax-free growth, especially if youâ€™re in a lower tax bracket now.

3. **Keep Some Liquid**: Not all your cash should be locked away. Make sure youâ€™ve got money in your taxable accounts for future adventures or emergencies. Plus, theyâ€™re a good spot for capital gains. 

4. **Spread Some Risk**: Diversify, diversify, diversify. No, it's not just a sloganâ€”it's a financial mantra. Mix your stocks, bonds, and cash across all types of accounts according to your risk appetite.

5. **Check and Adjust? Yes, Please!**: Donâ€™t just set it and forget it. Review your strategy regularly. Life changes, and so should your financial plan!
