Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—that’s free money!
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** Max out your IRA contributions next to take advantage of tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Fund these with any remaining money after maxing out retirement accounts, particularly for short- to medium-term goals.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains can be taxed, so consider holding tax-efficient investments here.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Prioritize equities in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for long-term growth.
   - **Income-Producing Investments:** Consider placing bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to optimize tax situations.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**
   - **Younger Investors:** Focus on growth in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Near Retirement:** Shift towards income generation and capital preservation.

### 5. **Periodic Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial objectives.

### Conclusion
Tailoring your contributions to meet your specific situation is key. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
