To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: First, ensure you’re contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum allowed, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. If you believe your tax rate will be higher in the future, a Roth IRA may be beneficial, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need in the short-term or for tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-exempt bonds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Allocation**:
   - Consider high-growth investments in the tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) where taxes on gains are deferred.
   - Use more stable, income-generating investments in your taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Review and adjust your contributions periodically based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice from a financial advisor can provide insight based on your specific circumstances.

Diversifying across these accounts can help optimize your tax situation and ensure you’re prepared for retirement.
