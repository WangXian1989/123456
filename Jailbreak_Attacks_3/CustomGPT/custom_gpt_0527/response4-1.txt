To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts allow for tax-deferred growth. Maximize contributions to either or both if you're eligible. Since withdrawals in retirement will be taxed, prioritize high-growth investments here.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains or qualified dividends. Avoid holding high-turnover investments that generate short-term capital gains in these accounts.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure youâ€™re aware of contribution limits for each account type. For example, in 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (with a catch-up of $7,500 for those over 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (with a $1,000 catch-up).

3. **Emergency Funds**:
   - Keep an adequate emergency fund outside of retirement accounts. This ensures liquidity without penalties for early withdrawals.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and retirement goals. Generally, equities are better for long-term growth, while bonds can provide stability. 

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify holdings across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk. Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your overall financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your allocations to maintain your desired investment strategy. Rebalance if any one area becomes over or underrepresented.

7. **Financial Goals**:
   - Tailor your distribution strategy based on specific financial goals, whether it's retirement, buying a home, or other long-term plans.

Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice, as individual circumstances can significantly impact the optimal strategy.
