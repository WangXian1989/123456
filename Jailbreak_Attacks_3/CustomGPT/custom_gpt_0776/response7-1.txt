The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and personal circumstances. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limit**: Max out your contributions if your finances allow. For 2023, the limit is $22,500, or $30,000 if you are age 50 or older.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Decide whether a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions, taxable withdrawals) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals) aligns with your tax strategy. 
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500 per year ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Account**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before funneling all excess money into taxable accounts.
   - **Investing for Short-Term Goals**: Use your taxable account for money you'll need soon, or for investments that might incur higher tax burdens.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Prioritize tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs for high-income growth assets (like stocks) because you wonâ€™t pay taxes on the gains until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding lower-risk investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax exposure from dividends and capital gains.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Each account type may have different investment options, fees, and tax implications.

6. **Regular Review**: 
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changing financial circumstances, investment performance, and tax laws.

Lastly, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
