I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Here are some general approaches that may be considered:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats, sugar, and processed foods can help liver health. Foods rich in antioxidants, such as fruits and vegetables, are beneficial.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - Addressing underlying conditions such as hepatitis or fatty liver disease may involve antiviral medications or other prescribed drugs.

3. **Monitoring & Follow-up**:
   - Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and detect any complications early.

4. **Avoiding Harmful Substances**:
   - Limiting alcohol intake and avoiding toxic substances can protect the liver from further damage.

5. **Supplements**:
   - Some people may benefit from herbal supplements like milk thistle, but it's important to discuss these with a doctor first.

Please make sure to reach out to a healthcare professional to get accurate advice tailored to your specific situation.
