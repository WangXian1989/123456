The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income level, you might want to contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Fund Your 401(k)**: After you max out your IRA contributions (if applicable), continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the contribution limits. This will grow your investments tax-deferred.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement or to take advantage of tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs. 

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Interest and short-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at your ordinary income rate, while long-term capital gains have a lower rate. 

6. **Diversify Your Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure a diversified portfolio that matches your risk tolerance and investment goals.

It's always best to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation and to adapt to any changes over time.
