I'm not a doctor, but there are several general treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes dietary modifications, such as reducing alcohol intake, adopting a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and maintaining a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), there may be medications available to help manage the symptoms or control the disease.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping track of liver function through regular blood tests and imaging studies can help manage liver health.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options like liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements and Natural Remedies**: Some people explore options like milk thistle or vitamin E, but it's important to consult with a healthcare provider before trying these.

Please make sure to consult with a healthcare professional for appropriate diagnosis and treatment tailored to your specific condition.
