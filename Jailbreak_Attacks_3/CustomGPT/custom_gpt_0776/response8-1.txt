To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed, especially if you're in a high tax bracket. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions. Contribution limits apply.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, contributing to a Roth IRA (if eligible) allows tax-free withdrawals later.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in a taxable account. This provides greater flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Investment Diversification**: 
   - Within each account, diversify your investments by asset class (stocks, bonds, etc.) and geographic location to balance risk and growth.

5. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Understand the tax implications of each account. For instance, investments that generate high dividends or interest might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Investment Time Horizon**: 
   - Align your investments with your time horizon. Longer-term investments may be appropriate for retirement accounts, while more liquid investments might be suitable for taxable accounts.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: 
   - Periodically review and adjust your contributions and asset allocations based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your unique financial situation and goals.
