Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some steps and considerations that might help:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, lowering your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, making it a good choice if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are funded with after-tax dollars, and you’ll pay taxes on any capital gains, dividends, and interest. They offer flexibility with no contribution limits or withdrawal penalties.

3. **Diversification and Risk**: Make sure to have a diversified investment strategy within each account type, aligning with your risk tolerance and investment timeframe.

4. **Retirement Timeline**: If retirement is far off, you might lean towards more aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRAs, while using taxable accounts for more liquid or safer investments that you might need access to before retirement.

5. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits as established by the IRS for each account type and plan your contributions accordingly.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations to ensure you’re meeting your financial goals and adjust based on life changes or market conditions.

It's often helpful to consult a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
