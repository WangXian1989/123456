Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowed ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're over 50). Consider your investment options and fees.
   - **IRA**: Once your 401(k) match is maxed, contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) depending on your income level and retirement tax strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate taxable income, like bonds, or for short-term savings goals.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, stocks might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to their potential for higher growth.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation or investment performance.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your individual circumstances.
