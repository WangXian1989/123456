To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. This is especially vital if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, ensure a well-diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. This could include stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you've maxed out your tax-advantaged contributions, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts. These allow for more flexible withdrawal options without penalties.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Proactively think about your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts continue to grow.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal financial situations vary significantly, so consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific needs and goals.

Adjust your contributions based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals to ensure an optimal distribution over time.
