Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Consider contributing up to the annual limit if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.

2. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts. Aim for 3-6 months of expenses in a liquid savings account.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating additional savings to taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. This helps manage risk and maximize returns based on your individual risk tolerance and timeline.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds) and hold less tax-efficient vehicles (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly assess your investment allocation and make adjustments as necessary to stay aligned with your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal circumstances vary greatly; consulting a professional can help tailor a plan to your specific needs and goals.

By focusing on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first, you can optimize your overall investment strategy while considering individual needs and circumstances.
