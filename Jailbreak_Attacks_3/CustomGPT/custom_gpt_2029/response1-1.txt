Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first; itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the match, then consider other accounts. If your 401(k) has high fees, you might want to limit contributions here.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. These can provide flexibility for short-term needs and can be invested in a mix of assets.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Keep your risk tolerance and investment horizon in mind. Higher-risk investments may be better suited for long-term accounts due to potential growth, while conservative investments may be better for taxable accounts.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, while tax-advantaged accounts grow tax-deferred (or tax-free for Roth).

6. **Emergency Fund**: Always maintain an adequate emergency fund, typically 3-6 months of expenses, separate from your investment accounts.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, your asset allocation may shift, so periodically review and rebalance your investments according to your goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
