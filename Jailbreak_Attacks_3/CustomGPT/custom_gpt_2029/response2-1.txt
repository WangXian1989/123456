To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your investment growth.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of low-cost index funds and mutual funds that match your risk tolerance. Look for options that provide a good balance between stocks and bonds.
   - **IRA**: Use this account for investments that may have the potential for higher returns since you can defer taxes. Consider a mix of stocks, ETFs, or mutual funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in lower-turnover funds to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider tax-efficient index funds or municipal bonds, which may provide tax-free income.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for your retirement withdrawals. Generally, you'll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (401(k), IRA) accounts, to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial goals and tax situation.

By aligning your investments with your financial goals and taking advantage of tax benefits, you'll optimize your overall wealth growth.
