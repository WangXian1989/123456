To optimize the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deductions and tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA Considerations**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Timeline**
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals (less than 5 years) since they offer easier access to funds. Reserve tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance, with potentially higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth potential before retirement.

### 3. **Contribution Limits and Matching**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match before funding your IRA or taxable accounts.
   - **Annual Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs to avoid penalties.

### 4. **Withdrawals and Penalties**
   - **Know the Rules**: Understand the withdrawal rules for each account type to avoid early withdrawal penalties, especially with IRAs.

### Implementation
- **Create a Plan**: Regularly review and adjust contributions based on your financial situation and changes in tax law.
- **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.
