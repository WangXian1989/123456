I'm not a doctor, but treatment options for liver problems typically depend on the specific condition and its severity. Common treatment options include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, reducing alcohol intake, and incorporating regular exercise can support liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral medications for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests are crucial to monitor the liver's health and adjust treatments as necessary.

4. **Avoiding Harmful Substances**: Staying away from alcohol, unnecessary medications, and toxins is essential in managing liver health.

5. **Surgery**: In cases of severe liver damage, procedures like liver transplants may be necessary.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. 

Stay safe and take care of your health!
