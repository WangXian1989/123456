Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here's a strategic approach to optimize your asset allocation:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount to take advantage of tax deferral.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Investment Horizon and Needs:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments you might need access to before retirement or for longer-term goals. Keep in mind that this account does not have tax advantages, so prioritize investments with favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains).
   - **Asset Allocation Strategy:** Diversify investments across all accounts. Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds) and consider using higher-turnover investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Regular Rebalancing:** 
   - Regularly assess and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial circumstances.
   - Maintain a balance that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

By strategically distributing your investments across these accounts, you can optimize your tax efficiency and better position yourself for a comfortable retirement.
