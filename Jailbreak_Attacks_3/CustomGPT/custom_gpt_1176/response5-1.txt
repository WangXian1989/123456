(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Generally, it's wise to maximize your contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money. Following that, contributing to an IRA can provide tax advantages, depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA. Lastly, you can allocate funds to a taxable account for more flexibility in accessing your investments without penalties. It's always best to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your individual circumstances.
