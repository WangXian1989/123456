I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. However, some common treatment options might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, and managing weight.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular follow-ups and monitoring liver function tests to track any changes in liver health.
4. **Supplements**: Some may find benefits from supplements like milk thistle, but you should discuss any supplements with your doctor first.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis or liver tumors, surgical options or liver transplant may be necessary.

Always seek medical advice to get a diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
