Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first as it's essentially free money.
   - After securing the match, consider maximizing your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax strategy).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to traditional 401(k)s and IRAs may reduce your current taxable income, so consider your tax bracket when deciding how much to contribute.
   - Roth accounts provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, ideal for those who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within these accounts, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. For long-term growth, consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower tax liabilities (like index funds or ETFs) to avoid higher capital gains taxes.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep in mind your liquidity needs. Taxable accounts can provide more flexibility for short-term needs without penalties that might apply to retirement accounts.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance, and rebalance as necessary.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice suited to your unique situation, consider working with a financial advisor.

Itâ€™s essential to assess your specific circumstances to find the most effective distribution strategy for you.
