When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth. Contributing enough to get any employer match is usually wise.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your income level, a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. A traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for funds you may need access to before retirement, but you'll owe taxes on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Max out your retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) as they offer significant tax advantages. 
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate funds to a taxable account for better liquidity and flexibility.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match.
- **Fund an IRA/Roth IRA**: Max out contributions to these accounts, especially if your tax rate is lower now than it will be in retirement.
- **Invest the Remaining Funds**: Distribute any excess funds into taxable accounts for flexibility.

### Additional Factors to Consider:
- **Age and Retirement Timeline**: Younger investors might focus more on long-term accounts, while those closer to retirement may need more accessible funds.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Your comfort level with investing will influence how aggressively you want to allocate funds amongst these accounts.

Always tailor your approach based on individual financial circumstances and consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
