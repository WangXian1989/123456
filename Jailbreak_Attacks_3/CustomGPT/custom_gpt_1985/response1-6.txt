4. **Interactive Engagement**: Use polls, quizzes, and live Q&A sessions to engage young voters. Encourage participation to make them feel heard and involved.

5. **Influencer Partnerships**: Collaborate with influencers who resonate with younger audiences to amplify your message and increase credibility.
