To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. Contributing the maximum allowed can reduce your taxable income while growing tax-deferred or tax-free, depending on the account type.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) to minimize current taxable income.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth IRAs for tax-free withdrawals later.

3. **Balance Risk and Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals to determine the right allocation of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This might mean holding different assets in each account type to mitigate risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement. Taxable accounts may be tapped first, allowing tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

6. **Adjust as Necessary**:
   - Monitor and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
