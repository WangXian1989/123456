The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Max Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (usually around 3-6%).
   - **Pre-Tax Benefits**: Contributions lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Good if you want a tax deduction now; contributions may reduce your taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Can access funds anytime without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower tax rates.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:

- **Prioritize the 401(k)**: If there’s a match, max that out first.
- **Contribute to an IRA**: Aim to max out contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings after maxing out retirement accounts.

### General Guidelines:

- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient savings outside of these accounts for emergencies.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio within each account type.
- **Rebalance Annually**: Adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances.
