Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. This can be a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax preference.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts**
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. This can be beneficial for short-term goals or flexibility.

### 3. **Consider Economic Factors**
   - **Fees and Investment Options**: Compare the fees and investment options in your 401(k) and IRA to ensure you’re getting the best return potential.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Tailor your investment choices based on the account type. For example, you might want to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, while using tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically assess and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

### 5. **Stay Informed About Tax Benefits**
   - Be aware of tax implications for withdrawals and the benefits of each account type for your long-term strategy.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
