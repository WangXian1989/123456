Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and financial goals. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your current taxable income. Consider maxing this out if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, compare the benefits of a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) versus a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). A Roth is usually better for younger investors expecting higher future income.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding a taxable account. This provides flexibility without the restrictions of retirement accounts.

5. **Investment Diversification**: Keep in mind the types of investments in each account. Taxable accounts benefit from long-term capital gains rates, so consider holding assets with lower turnover.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can offer personalized advice tailored to your situation.

This strategy helps balance immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential.
