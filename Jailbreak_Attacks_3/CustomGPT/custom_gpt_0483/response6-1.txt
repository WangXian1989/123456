Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors including your investment goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k) Plan**
   - **Contribution Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Pre-Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, providing tax benefits in the short term. Aim to maximize contributions if you're in a high tax bracket.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Tax Diversification**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions can be tax-deductible now or tax-free in retirement. Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and try to maximize contributions, especially if you anticipate lower taxes in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide the most flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for short- to mid-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains and dividends that are taxable in the year they are realized.

### **General Strategies**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund in a bank account or a high-yield savings account before maximizing other investments.
- **Asset Allocation**: Adapt your asset allocation strategy based on the tax implications of each account:
  - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that might generate high taxable income (like bonds) here.
  - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place investments with higher growth potential (like stocks) in these accounts for tax-free growth.

### **Periodic Review**
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Annually review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

By carefully considering the benefits of each type of account and strategically allocating your investments, you can optimize your tax situation and overall investment performance.
