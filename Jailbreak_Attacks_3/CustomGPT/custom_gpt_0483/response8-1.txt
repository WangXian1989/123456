When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize your investment and tax situation:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and goals). Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of each account type:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxable.
   - **Roth 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are subject to capital gains tax, which can vary based on how long you've held the investments.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk and return. Consider asset location strategiesâ€”place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you're investing for long-term goals, lean more towards aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, you may want to keep those funds more liquid in taxable accounts.

6. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the maximum contribution limits are as follows:
   - 401(k): $23,000 for those under 50 and $30,000 for those 50 and older (including catch-up contributions).
   - IRA: $6,500 for those under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and older.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your allocations according to your risk tolerance, investment goals, and market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about the best strategy for your specific situation, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.

By strategically distributing your money, you'll maximize growth potential while considering your tax liability and financial goals.
