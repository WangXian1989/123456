Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Depending on your income, a Roth IRA might be advantageous for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** 401(k) and traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions, growing tax-deferred until withdrawal. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later, a Roth may be better. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here do not have tax advantages, but they offer flexibility. Consider holding investments that generate lower tax burdens (like long-term capital gains).

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Maintain a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance in all accounts. Generally:
     - **401(k):** Look for low-cost index funds.
     - **IRA:** Use a mix of growth and income investments.
     - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on tax-efficient investments (index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**
   - Keep an emergency fund in a savings account or low-risk investments separate from your retirement accounts. This ensures you can handle immediate financial needs without tapping into long-term investments.

### 5. **Regularly Review Your Strategy**
   - Your goals, market conditions, and tax laws change. Regularly review and adjust your contributions and allocations to stay on track toward your financial goals.

### Conclusion
A well-rounded approach typically includes maxing out your 401(k) and IRA first, prioritizing tax efficiency in your taxable account, and ensuring you're diversified across all investment types. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your unique situation.
