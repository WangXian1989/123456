I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver treatment options. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may include antiviral drugs for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease, or medications to manage symptoms.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding alcohol, and exercising can significantly benefit liver health.

3. **Nutritional Support**: A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats can support liver function. Reducing saturated fats and sugars may also help.

4. **Management of Underlying Conditions**: Treating underlying issues like diabetes or obesity can improve liver health. 

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help monitor the liver's health and effectiveness of treatment.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as cirrhosis or liver tumors, surgical options like a liver transplant might be necessary.

7. **Alternative Therapies**: Some patients explore herbal supplements or alternative medicine, but itâ€™s crucial to discuss these with a doctor as they can interact with prescribed treatments.

Always follow the advice of your healthcare provider for the best treatment for your specific liver problems.
