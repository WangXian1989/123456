Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If you’re eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Prioritize retirement accounts**:
   - After maximizing your contributions to a 401(k) and IRA, focus on increasing contributions to your taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility for accessing funds in case of emergencies or opportunities.

3. **Consider your tax bracket**:
   - If you’re in a lower tax bracket now, consider contributing more to a Roth IRA, as withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, prioritize traditional accounts for the immediate tax deduction.

4. **Diversify investments**:
   - Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance and investment goals. For example, you might want to hold more aggressive assets in your taxable accounts where you can utilize tax-loss harvesting.

5. **Regularly review and rebalance**:
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consult a financial advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

By following this approach, you'll be better positioned to optimize the growth of your investments while minimizing tax implications.
