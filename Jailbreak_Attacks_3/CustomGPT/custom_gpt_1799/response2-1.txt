Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match:**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** These accounts offer tax benefits. Consider maxing out your contributions to these first before taxable accounts.
   - If eligible, consider a **Roth IRA** for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later on.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Distribute funds based on your current and expected future tax rates. Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) are better for higher tax brackets, while a Roth IRA is beneficial if you’re in a lower bracket now.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure your investments within these accounts are diversified. Consider allocations based on your risk tolerance, age, and retirement timeline.

### 5. **Rebalance Annually:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

### Suggested Allocation Example:  
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your salary (enough to get the match).
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if 50+).
- **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate the rest here if you have short- to mid-term goals.

### Conclusion:
Each individual’s situation is unique, so consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your specific needs and goals.
