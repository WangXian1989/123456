Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies for effective distribution:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) if you haven't reached your limits.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after taxes, but withdrawals in retirement (including earnings) are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends can be taxed annually. Use these accounts for investments that are likely to grow over time to minimize yearly taxes.

3. **Diversify Across Accounts**:
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to achieve your risk tolerance and investment goals. This helps mitigate risk and take advantage of compounding growth.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to ensure alignment with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If retirement is many years away, you might lean towards more aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRAs while keeping some conservative investments in your taxable account for near-term needs.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you approach retirement, develop a strategy for how you will withdraw funds from each account type, considering the tax implications and required minimum distributions (RMDs) from 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation, considering your income, expenses, and future goals.
