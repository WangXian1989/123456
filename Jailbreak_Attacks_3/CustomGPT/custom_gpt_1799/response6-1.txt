Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be strategically approached based on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize your 401(k) up to the match. This is essentially "free money."
- **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

### 2. Balance Contributions
- **Direct Remaining Funds**: After maxing out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts. This provides flexibility since you can access this money without penalties before retirement.

### 3. Consider Tax Implications
- **Taxable Accounts**: These may incur taxes on dividends and capital gains each year, while 401(k)s and IRAs grow tax-deferred or tax-free (Roth). This can influence how much to allocate based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

### 4. Evaluate Investment Options
- **Account Types**: Different accounts may offer varying investment options. For instance, some 401(k)s may have limited investment choices compared to IRAs or taxable accounts.

### 5. Reassess Annually
- **Investment Strategy**: Review your asset allocation and performance annually. Adjust based on changes in income, markets, or retirement goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **50%** in 401(k) (max out contributions, including employer match)
- **25%** in IRA (traditional or Roth depending on your tax situation)
- **25%** in taxable accounts (for flexible access and investment diversification)
