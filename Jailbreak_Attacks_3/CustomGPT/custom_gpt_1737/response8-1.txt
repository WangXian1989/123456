Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: These accounts offer tax advantages. Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA are typically tax-deductible, which can lower your current tax bill. Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold. They provide flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of living expenses) in a readily accessible account.

4. **Investment Goals**: 
   - If your goal is long-term retirement, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA for their tax advantages.
   - For shorter-term goals, like buying a house or paying for education, consider using a taxable account.

5. **Diversification**: Make sure to diversify your investments within each account type, spreading your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

6. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might lean towards a more aggressive allocation in stocks to take advantage of compounding returns, while older investors may prefer a conservative approach to preserve capital.

7. **Regular Review and Adjustment**: Periodically review your allocation strategy, and adjust as needed based on changes in income, market conditions, or personal circumstances.

It's essential to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that works best for your specific situation.
