The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Max out your employer's match if available. This is essentially free money. After that, consider contributing enough to reach the maximum limit if your budget allows.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can be beneficial, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. If not, consider a traditional IRA for its tax-deductible benefits. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've contributed to your 401(k) and IRA, you can allocate any extra funds to taxable accounts. This is especially useful for short-term goals since you can access these funds without penalty.

**Consider Tax Implications**: Generally, itâ€™s wise to keep high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and lower-growth investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains. 

A balanced approach tailored to your investment goals and timeline is key. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies.
