To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to the 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible; withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on capital gains and dividends, making them less tax-efficient for long-term growth.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Identify whether your goals are short-term or long-term, as this can influence where to allocate funds.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each type of account to maximize your contributions effectively.

4. **Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match before investing in other accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Consider your need for liquidity. Taxable accounts provide more flexibility since funds can be accessed without penalties.

6. **Asset Location**:
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA) and income-generating investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Since individual circumstances vary greatly, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.

Consider creating a balanced strategy focusing on maximizing tax efficiency while meeting your financial goals.
