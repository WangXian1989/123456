I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for any liver issues. Generally, treatment options can vary depending on the specific liver condition. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes like avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy diet, and regular exercise. Medications may also be prescribed for certain conditions, or in severe cases, a medical procedure or transplant might be necessary. Always best to get tailored advice from your doctor!
