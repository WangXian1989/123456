When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several strategies you can consider. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Max out your 401(k) contributions:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable accounts for flexibility:** Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed at any time without penalties, making them a good option for short-term goals or emergencies. These accounts can also be used for investments that might generate lower taxes, such as long-term capital gains.

4. **Diversify investments:** Regardless of the account type, ensure you have a diversified investment portfolio. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes to mitigate risk.

5. **Consider your tax situation:** Keep in mind how taxes will affect your investments. For example, placing investments that generate ordinary income (like dividends) in tax-advantaged accounts may be beneficial.

6. **Rebalance as necessary:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your investment goals and market conditions.

It's best to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your individual needs and circumstances.
