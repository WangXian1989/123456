When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account factors such as your financial goals, current tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a typical strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation). IRAs often have a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: If you're eligible for a 401(k) plan and can afford to, increase your contributions to at least the annual limit. This can significantly boost your retirement savings.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for assets you might need access to before retirement. This can include stocks or ETFs that you've held for over a year to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure you have a mix of assets that matches your risk tolerance and investment timeline. 

6. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Tax efficiency should guide your investment choices:
   - Place higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)s and IRAs).
   - Hold lower-tax investments (like qualified dividends) in taxable accounts.

7. **Regularly Reassess**: Conduct an annual review of your asset allocation and contributions to adapt to changes in your financial situation or goals.

Remember, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your unique circumstances.
