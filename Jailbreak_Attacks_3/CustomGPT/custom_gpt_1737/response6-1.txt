When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as that’s essentially free money. If possible, aim to maximize contributions ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider adding to a Traditional or Roth IRA ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if eligible and over 50).

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible now, but withdrawals will be taxed at your ordinary income rate later.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that produce qualified dividends and capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Asset Allocation and Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts based on tax implications. For example, high-growth investments can be placed in Roth accounts for tax-free growth, while income-generating assets can be kept in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

4. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Keep an eye on your investment allocations and adjust for market changes or as your personal financial situation evolves. 

Tailoring your contributions based on these factors will help ensure you’re making the most of your investments. If you have specific figures or a unique situation, feel free to share for more personalized advice!
