Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money!

2. **IRA Contributions:** Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth. 

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is a good place for investments that you might want to access sooner or that generate tax-efficient income (like qualified dividends).

4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:** Your investment mix should reflect your risk tolerance and how long you have until you need the funds. Generally, younger investors can afford to take on more risk (more stocks), while those closer to retirement might focus on bonds and safer investments.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes to help manage risk.

6. **Regular Rebalancing:** Periodically check your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor this advice to your specific situation. What are your primary goals—retirement, buying a home, or something else?
