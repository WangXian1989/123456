Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Treatment often depends on the specific condition, but some options may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in some cases, procedures. Always seek medical advice for the best course of action for your health.
