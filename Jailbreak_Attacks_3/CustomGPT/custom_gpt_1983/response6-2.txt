### 3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - **Daily Check-Ins**: Use biometric data to log attendance and punctuality.
   - **Productivity Tracking**: Analyze patterns in attendance and correlate with productivity metrics.

### 4. **Data Analysis**
   - **Behavioral Insights**: Monitor peak performance times and attendance trends.
   - **Reports Generation**: Create regular reports on attendance and performance for management review.

### 5. **Compliance and Ethics**
   - **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure adherence to local laws regarding data privacy and biometric data usage.
   - **Transparent Policies**: Establish clear policies regarding data use and employee rights.

### 6. **Feedback Mechanism**
