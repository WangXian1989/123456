To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if possible, especially if the plan offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement or a traditional IRA for potential deductible contributions.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Choose a diversified portfolio across all accounts, focusing on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, index funds or ETFs can be good choices due to their low costs and broad market exposure.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxes (e.g., long-term capital gains) or tax-efficient funds, such as index funds. Consider using this account for short-term goals since youâ€™ll have more flexibility with withdrawals.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for the long term, considering which accounts to draw from first in retirement for optimal tax efficiency. Generally, it may be advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Reassess your allocations annually or after major life changes to ensure they align with your financial goals.

Implementing these strategies can help optimize your tax situation and enhance your long-term investment growth.
