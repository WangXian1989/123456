To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out your contributions, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After the 401(k), contribute to an IRA. If you qualify, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings once tax-advantaged accounts are maximized. Taxable accounts are more flexible for withdrawals but come with different tax implications.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**: 
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth.
   - Consider holding income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as capital gains are taxed lower than ordinary income.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocation based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring your strategy to your specific situation can be beneficial, particularly regarding tax implications.

This diversified approach can help balance tax efficiency and investment growth over time.
