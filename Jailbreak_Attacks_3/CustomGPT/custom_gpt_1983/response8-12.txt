I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet low in fat, sugar, and salt. Consider foods rich in antioxidants like fruits and vegetables.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption can significantly improve liver health.

4. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating conditions like diabetes, high cholesterol, or obesity can have positive effects on liver health.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help monitor the health of your liver.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

7. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but consult your doctor first.

Make sure to discuss these options with a healthcare professional for a tailored treatment plan.
