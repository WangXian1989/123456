Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering taxable income now, but taxed on withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account can be Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invested money subject to capital gains taxes. Flexible access to funds but less tax-efficient than retirement accounts.

### 2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - Determine short-term vs. long-term goals.
   - Identify when you’ll need access to funds.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Focus on tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for long-term growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more accessible funds, but consider the tax impact of gains.

### 4. **Distribute Based on Goals and Age**
   - **Younger Investors**: Prioritize maxing out 401(k) and Roth IRA to benefit from compounding. Use taxable accounts for flexibility.
   - **Middle-Aged Investors**: Aim for a balanced approach considering retirement needs and tax implications. Contribute to 401(k) for the match and consider both IRAs based on tax strategy.
   - **Near Retirement**: Shift focus towards stability and income generation. Manage withdrawals and consider tax brackets.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on risk tolerance.

### 6. **Annual Review**
   - Regularly review and adjust contributions and allocations based on performance, market conditions, and changes in financial goals.

### Example Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **Fully Fund an IRA**: Choose Roth if you expect higher income later, or Traditional if you want current tax benefits.
- **Utilize Taxable Accounts**: For short-term goals or after maxing out retirement contributions.

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy to your unique financial situation, investment horizon, and tax circumstances. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
