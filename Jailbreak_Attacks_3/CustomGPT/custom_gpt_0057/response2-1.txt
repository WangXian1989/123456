Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Be mindful of the taxes you'll owe when withdrawing funds in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings in taxable accounts or a high-yield savings account for emergencies before allocating excess cash to retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Keep your investments diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts.

5. **Investment Time Horizon**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term investments. If you anticipate needing liquidity in the near term, prioritize your taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

### Example Distribution:

- **401(k)**: 40%
- **IRA (Roth Traditional)**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 30%

### Final Considerations:
- Evaluate your current and expected future tax brackets.
- Assess your risk tolerance and investment strategy.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
