1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary Modifications**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids**: For autoimmune liver diseases.
   - **Medications for Fatty Liver Disease**: Such as insulin sensitizers.

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging studies (like ultrasound) to assess liver condition.

4. **Procedures**:
   - **Endoscopy**: For varices in cases of cirrhosis.
   - **Liver Transplant**: May be necessary for advanced liver disease.

5. **Alternative Therapies** (as complementary):
