I'm not a doctor, but the best treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition. Generally, here are some common strategies:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and reducing alcohol intake can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver issue (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), certain medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and progress.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation might be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from vitamins or supplements, but consult a healthcare provider first.

It's crucial to discuss your specific situation with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
