Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a methodical approach to help you consider your options:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions, which is essentially "free money." The growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Offers tax advantages depending on the type. Traditional IRAs allow tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don't have the same tax advantages but offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Are you saving specifically for retirement, a home, or another purpose?

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, particularly if your 401(k) has a company match. This helps reduce taxable income and can lead to substantial long-term growth.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Distributing your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts can help manage risk.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type to optimize your tax advantages while maximizing growth potential.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have adequate savings in a liquid form for emergencies before committing most of your funds to retirement accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly monitor and adjust your investment allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.
