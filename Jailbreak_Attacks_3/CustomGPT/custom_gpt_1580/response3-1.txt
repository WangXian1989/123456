Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, current tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a step-by-step approach to help you decide:

1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offered by employers, it allows pre-tax contributions and tax-deferred growth. Some employers offer matching contributions, which can be an excellent benefit to leverage.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar tax benefits to a 401(k) but with different contribution limits and eligibility criteria. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals under certain conditions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts allow you to invest without the tax benefits of retirement accounts. However, capital gains taxes apply when you realize profits. They offer more liquidity and flexibility than retirement accounts.

2. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Are you saving primarily for retirement, or do you have shorter-term goals? Retirement accounts are better for long-term growth due to tax advantages, while taxable accounts might be better suited for shorter-term savings.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out employer-sponsored retirement accounts to take advantage of matching contributions first. In 2023, the contribution limit for 401(k) plans is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - Then, consider contributing to an IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA might be preferable for tax-free withdrawals. If you believe you’ll be in a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) could offer significant tax breaks now.
   - Taxable accounts can provide flexibility for short-term goals without penalties for early withdrawal that come with retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**:
   - Consider diversifying your investments based on risk tolerance. Generally, riskier assets (like stocks) are more suitable for long-term accounts (like your 401(k) or IRA), while more stable investments (like bonds or cash) may be better in taxable accounts due to capital gains taxes.
   - Adjust your allocation by account to optimize after-tax returns. Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on income.

6. **Regular Reassessment**:
   - Regularly review your allocation and performance. Life changes, market conditions, and tax laws may warrant adjustments.

7. **Consider Professional Guidance**:
   - If unsure, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to meet your financial goals.
