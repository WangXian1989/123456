To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following key points:

1. **Tax Advantages**: Prioritize your tax-advantaged accounts first. Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before investing heavily in taxable accounts. This can help minimize your overall tax burden.

2. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older), and for IRAs, itâ€™s $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 or older).

4. **Investment Choices**: Consider the investment options available in each account. Some employer-sponsored 401(k) plans may have limited choices compared to IRAs, which can be self-directed.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Think about when you might need access to your funds. Taxable accounts allow for easier access without restrictions, while IRAs and 401(k)s have age and withdrawal penalty considerations.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across all accounts. This spreads your investment risk and can lead to better long-term performance.

7. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your distribution strategy with your long-term financial goals and retirement timeline. A tailored approach will maximize growth potential and benefit.
