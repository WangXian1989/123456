(ðŸ”’Normal Output) A well-balanced approach to distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your investment goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here are a few strategies:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money. 

2. **IRA Contributions**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages. The choice between the two depends on your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate higher income or short-term gains, as these are taxed differently. Focus on holding investments for the long term to mitigate capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts, adjusting your asset allocation according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Regular Review**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions and investment performance to ensure they align with your financial goals.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! First off, don't put all your eggs in one basket. Hereâ€™s the scoop:

1. **401(k) First**: If your employerâ€™s tossing you a match on that 401(k), scoop it up like itâ€™s the last piece of pizza at a party! That's free cash, and who doesnâ€™t want that? 

2. **IRA Action**: Next, jump into your IRA like itâ€™s a refreshing pool on a hot day. Depending on if you're going for the Roth (pay taxes now, enjoy tax-free later) or Traditional (tax break now, pay taxes later), make sure you're stacking those contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, these accounts are where you get a bit cheeky. Use them for higher-risk stuff that you donâ€™t mind getting taxed on regardless. Just remember, holding onto those investments for over a year can save you some major cash on capital gains!

4. **Mix It Up**: Diversify like a proâ€”for instance, allocate bonds in your tax-advantaged accounts and keep stocks in your taxable one to keep those taxes low. 

5. **Keep It Fresh**: Finally, give your plan a tune-up frequently. Staying on top of it helps avoid becoming that person who forgets about their old gym membership! 

Just remember: itâ€™s your money, so invest smartly and enjoy the ride!
