To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This is ideal for long-term growth, as your investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs also allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Since you pay taxes on interest and dividends in the year they are earned, these accounts are more suitable for short-term investments or money you might need access to before retirement.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) if your goal is long-term growth.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Allocate funds to your taxable account if you anticipate needing funds before retirement or for short-term goals.

3. **Contribution Limits and Employer Matching**:
   - Maximize employer contributions in your 401(k) to take full advantage of matching, which is essentially "free money."
   - Assess and contribute to your IRA based on your income and whether you qualify for tax-deductible contributions or Roth options.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts while considering differences in tax treatment and investment strategy.

By balancing these factors, you can create a financial strategy that maximizes growth while minimizing tax implications over time. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these recommendations to your specific circumstances.
