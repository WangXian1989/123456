Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax bracket, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider making contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **401(k)**: If you can still contribute after maximizing the match, keep funding your 401(k) for tax-deferred growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement or as an emergency fund. They can also hold investments like index funds or ETFs, which have favorable tax treatments on capital gains.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all these accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. **Withdrawals Strategy**: 
   - Plan for how and when you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement to manage your tax liability effectively.

Regularly review and adjust your strategy as your financial situation changes or as you get closer to retirement. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
