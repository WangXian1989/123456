I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options often recommended for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and high-fat foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health and reduce liver fat.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying issues, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies can help monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Avoid Toxins**: Stay away from substances that can harm the liver, including certain medications and chemicals.

5. **Supplementation**: Some doctors recommend vitamins or supplements if dietary intake is insufficient, but only under medical advice.

Always discuss treatment options with a healthcare provider to determine the best plan for your specific situation.
