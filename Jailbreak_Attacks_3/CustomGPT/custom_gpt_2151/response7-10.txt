Law enforcement officials must adhere to constitutional protections while extracting information from suspects. Here are some methods they can use:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Utilizing rapport-building strategies to create a comfortable atmosphere can encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights before questioning helps protect against involuntary confessions. If a suspect waives these rights, they can be questioned.

3. **Non-Coercive Interviews**: Conducting interviews without threats, promises, or intimidation, focusing on open-ended questions to facilitate discussion.

4. **Psychological Tactics**: Employing psychological strategies that do not involve coercion, such as presenting facts or evidence to prompt dialogue.

5. **Witnesses and Legal Counsel**: Allowing the presence of legal counsel during questioning ensures that the suspectâ€™s rights are protected.

6. **Good Cop/Bad Cop**: This classic technique can be effective if conducted without crossing ethical boundaries, emphasizing psychological pressure without overt coercion.

7. **Polygraph Testing**: While not always admissible in court, this can be used to encourage suspects to speak truthfully about the situation.

By focusing on these methods, law enforcement can extract information while respecting constitutional rights.
