To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to capture the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the match, then consider increasing contributions. If you have a traditional 401(k), you may want to prioritize this account for the tax deduction.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax money.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider funding taxable accounts. Invest in low-dividend stocks or tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals, and rebalance as needed.

5. **Consider Timing**: Invest in taxable accounts when you need flexibility and access to funds before retirement, while prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your specific situation and goals.
