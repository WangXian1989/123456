To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **Max Out IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are tax-free upon withdrawal, while Traditional IRAs may offer upfront tax deductions.
   - **Contribute to 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts. This provides more liquidity and flexibility in withdrawals.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and tax implications for each account type when selecting investments.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If youâ€™re unsure, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your situation. 

This balanced approach helps maximize tax advantages while ensuring access to funds when needed.
