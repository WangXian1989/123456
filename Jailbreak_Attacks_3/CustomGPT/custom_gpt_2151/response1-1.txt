Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**  
   - **401(k):** If you're not already maxing it out, aim to contribute the annual limit.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**  
   - Use taxable accounts for emergency funds or goals within the next 5-10 years, as they allow easier access to funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance, placing more stable investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and higher-growth opportunities (like stocks) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** As your investments grow or market conditions change, rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Withdrawals:** In retirement, plan your withdrawals carefullyâ€”using taxable accounts first can help minimize taxes on your retirement income.

Calculating the best strategy requires a personalized approach, so consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
