Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a thoughtful approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match first; this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA**: If you qualify based on your income, consider funding a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing your investments to grow tax-free.

3. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Next, prioritize maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and traditional IRA. This can provide immediate tax benefits as contributions are typically tax-deductible.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investment goals that are not long-term (like buying a home or funding education). These accounts allow for withdrawal flexibility, but be aware of capital gains taxes on profits.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth. Consider holding more tax-efficient investments, like bonds or index funds, in taxable accounts.

6. **Continuous Review**: Periodically review your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and your financial objectives.

A financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation, considering factors like age, income, and retirement goals.
