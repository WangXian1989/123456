When distributing your money among different investment accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to your employer-sponsored 401(k) to receive any available employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, as these accounts offer tax advantages. You can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) depending on your income and tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investments once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Place bonds and other interest-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)s and IRAs) where interest is taxed at ordinary income rates. Use taxable accounts for investments that produce qualified dividends or are expected to appreciate significantly (like stocks), as these can be taxed at lower long-term capital gains rates.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments effectively across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

3. **Regular Review & Adjustment**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired investment strategy.

4. **Consider Fees**: 
   - Be aware of any fees associated with your 401(k) and IRA account types, as these can impact your overall returns. Choose low-cost investment options when possible.

5. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Before allocating significant amounts to investments, ensure you have an emergency fund covering at least 3-6 months of expenses to avoid early withdrawals from retirement accounts, which can incur penalties.

By following these strategies, you can make informed decisions about how to distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.
