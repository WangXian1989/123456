Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you with your allocation:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with matching contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money”.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maximizing any employer match, focus on tax-advantaged accounts. This often means maxing out an IRA (Roth or Traditional) before funneling more money into a taxable account.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed when withdrawn. Good for higher-income years.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k). Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and other factors.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but growth and withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed on capital gains and dividends. Typically best for money you may need before retirement or for tax-efficient investments.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk. Consider stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your allocations. As your financial situation changes, you may need to adjust where you’re contributing.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, it may be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor who can take a comprehensive look at your situation.

Tracking your contributions and understanding how each account aligns with your financial goals is essential. Always keep an eye on fees and investment options available in your 401(k) and other accounts.
