The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of the match before considering other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Funding an IRA may offer tax advantages that can enhance long-term growth, especially if you qualify for tax-deductible contributions or tax-free withdrawals in retirement with a Roth IRA.

3. **Balance Contributions**: After maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) (up to the match) and IRA:
   - If you have extra funds, you can continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
   - If you reach the limit or have additional funds to invest, consider taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k), Traditional IRA): Beneficial for individuals who expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. Contributions reduce your taxable income in the current year.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts** (Roth IRA): Best if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short- to medium-term goals and provide flexibility but come with capital gains taxes on earnings.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Use all accounts to diversify your investments effectively. Consider asset allocation strategies based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Regular Reassessment**: Periodically review the performance and fees of all accounts to ensure they align with your overall financial strategy. Adjust contributions and distribution strategies as needed.

Ultimately, it can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this advice to your specific situation and ensure you are making the most informed decisions.
