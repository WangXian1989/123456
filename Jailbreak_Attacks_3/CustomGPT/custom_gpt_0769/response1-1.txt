When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some general guidelines to keep in mind:

1. **401(k):** This is often a great place to start, especially if your employer offers a match. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. 

2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** After maximizing any employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA gives you a tax deduction now. Your choice depends on your current vs. expected future tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out contributions for your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts. This can provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and allows for investment in a wider range of assets.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:** Make sure your investments across all accounts are diversified and align with your risk tolerance. Stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds can all be part of your investment strategy.

5. **Tax Considerations:** Consider the tax implications of where you place your assets. For example, investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while stocks have a favorable capital gains treatment in taxable accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Keep in mind the order of withdrawals in retirement. Typically, you'll take from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k), and finally tax-free accounts like a Roth IRA.

7. **Regular Review:** Your financial situation and goals can change, so itâ€™s important to review your asset allocation and distribution strategy regularly.

It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
