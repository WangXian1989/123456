When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs work like 401(k)s regarding pre-tax contributions and taxable withdrawals. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments may be taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains, often leading to a higher tax burden compared to tax-advantaged accounts.

2. **Retirement Goals**:
   - Consider your retirement age, desired lifestyle, and any other financial goals you may have. This informs how much you should contribute to tax-advantaged accounts versus taxable accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k) plans and $6,500 for IRAs, with catch-up contributions available for those aged 50 and older.

4. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside before investing significant amounts, as withdrawals from retirement accounts before age 59Â½ may incur penalties.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider using tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. For tax-advantaged accounts, consider more aggressive investments since the tax on income is deferred.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
  
2. **Contribute to IRAs**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation and eligibility.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maxing your IRA, keep contributing to your 401(k) up to the limit, especially if you want the tax benefits.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can be directed to taxable accounts, especially if you plan on using these funds before retirement.

5. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Periodically review your distributions to ensure they align with your changing financial situation and goals.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach, maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first, while keeping flexibility with taxable accounts, typically yields the best long-term benefits. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.
