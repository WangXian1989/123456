The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, your current tax situation, your age, and your retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve contributed to your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting additional savings into taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals, but remember that you’ll need to pay taxes on any capital gains and dividends.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Determine a suitable asset allocation strategy based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. For long-term goals, you might allocate more funds to equities for growth. For short-term needs, you might prefer more conservative investments like bonds or cash equivalents.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider the tax implications of your investments. For example, keep high-growth stocks that you plan to hold long-term in tax-advantaged accounts (like your IRA or 401(k)), while income-generating investments (like bonds or REITs) might be better held in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially as your financial situation or goals change.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It can be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that meets your specific needs and goals.

Overall, a balanced approach that takes advantage of tax benefits while also providing flexibility and aligning with your risk tolerance is essential.
