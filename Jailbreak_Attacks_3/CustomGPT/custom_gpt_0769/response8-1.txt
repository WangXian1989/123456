To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: First, ensure you’re taking full advantage of any employer match in your 401(k). This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Since contributions are made pre-tax (or post-tax if it’s a Roth 401(k)), this account is ideal for high-growth investments that can benefit from tax-deferral.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. You might want to prioritize Roth IRAs if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Place low-yielding bonds and assets with less favorable tax treatments here. This account is less tax-efficient for high-income-generating assets due to capital gains taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your age and risk tolerance:
   - Younger investors might focus more on stocks in their 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth.
   - As you near retirement, consider shifting some investments into more stable options like bonds.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that you’re diversifying your investments across all accounts to minimize risk. This includes having a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) in each of your accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how and when you will withdraw funds in retirement. Prioritize tax-efficient withdrawals to minimize taxes over the long run.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can be invaluable. An advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.

Ultimately, the best distribution approach combines maximizing tax advantages, focusing on long-term growth while maintaining a diverse and balanced investment portfolio. Consider your personal financial goals and timelines as you create your strategy.
