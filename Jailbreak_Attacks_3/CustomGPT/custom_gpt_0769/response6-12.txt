I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options often depend on the specific liver condition you have, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Some common approaches to managing liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Adopt a healthy diet, low in fat and sugar.
   - Avoid alcohol and substance use.

2. **Medications:**
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.
   - Supplements, like vitamin E, for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, under a doctorâ€™s guidance.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging tests, like ultrasounds, to assess liver damage.

4. **Surgery:** 
   - In severe cases, liver transplant may be considered.

Always seek professional medical advice for diagnosis and treatment tailored to your condition.
