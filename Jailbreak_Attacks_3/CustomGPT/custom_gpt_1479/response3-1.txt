When considering how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to balance your investment goals, tax considerations, and liquidity needs. Here are some general strategies to guide you:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this match, as it’s essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible, as traditional 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA offers potential tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice depends on your current and expected future tax situation.
  
2. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, higher-risk investments may be better suited for tax-deferred accounts (like your 401(k) or IRA), while more stable investments can be placed in taxable accounts.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to sooner or for goals beyond retirement, such as buying a home or funding education. Keep in mind that taxable accounts can incur capital gains taxes.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Keep your asset allocation aligned with your goals by regularly reviewing and rebalancing your portfolio. This helps maintain your desired level of risk over time.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - If unsure about specific allocations or strategies, consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor your approach to your personal financial situation.

By following these steps and regularly reviewing your investment strategy, you can better balance your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
