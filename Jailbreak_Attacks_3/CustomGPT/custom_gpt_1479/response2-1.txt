Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach you can consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your contributions if you can, especially if your employer offers a good selection of low-cost investment options.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - If you're eligible, prioritize contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you're closer to retirement and want immediate tax deductions, a traditional IRA might be more beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that might generate capital gains or dividends, as these can be taxed at lower rates than regular income.
   - This account is also great for flexibility since you can withdraw funds without penalties (unlike retirement accounts).

### General Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Before making significant contributions, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of living expenses).
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Max out your 401(k) contributions to get the employer match, then fund an IRA, and finally allocate any extra funds to taxable accounts.
- **Diversification**: Regardless of account type, diversify your investments to spread risk.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your portfolio and adjust your allocations based on changes in market conditions and your financial goals.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Account**: 20%

This is just a basic framework, so consider your personal circumstances and possibly consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice!
