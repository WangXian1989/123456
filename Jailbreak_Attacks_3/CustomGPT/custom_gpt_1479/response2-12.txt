Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can suggest that the best course of action for liver problems is to consult with a healthcare professional who can assess your specific condition and needs. Treatment options generally depend on the type and severity of the liver issue and may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or medical procedures. It's really crucial to get personalized advice from a healthcare provider. Stay proactive about your health!
