Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize employer match if available â€“ it's essentially free money.
   - Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income, but withdrawals will be taxed in retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, similar to a 401(k), but has different contribution limits and rules.
   - A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawal without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.
   - Investment gains are taxed, so it's best to hold tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs here.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Initial Focus**: Prioritize contributions to a 401(k) up to the employer match, then consider maxing out an IRA (preferably a Roth if eligible).
- **After Maxing Retirement Accounts**: Fund a taxable account for additional savings or short-term goals. This offers liquidity and flexibility.

### Example Breakdown:
- 401(k): 15-20% of your salary (max to employer match)
- IRA: Up to the contribution limit ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if age 50+)
- Taxable Accounts: Any additional savings focus.

Review your specific financial needs, contribution limits, and tax implications to create a tailored distribution strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor can further refine your plan based on your unique situation!
