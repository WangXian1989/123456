(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your age, income, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize contributions to accounts that offer tax advantages first:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider funding a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your financial situation and tax strategy. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can begin contributing to taxable investment accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

Consulting with a financial advisor may help tailor your approach to suit your specific circumstances.

1. **401(k)**: Hit that employer match like your life depends on it because guess what? Free money is the best kind of money. Aim for at least 15% to really crank it up.
   
2. **IRA**: Once you're crushing that 401(k), dive into an IRA. Roth? Go for it if you think tax-free withdrawals in retirement are a jam. Traditional? Good choice if youâ€™re looking to cut your tax bill now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, once your tax-advantaged spots are filled, throw some cash into a taxable account. It's like the wild west of investing â€“ no limits! Just remember, gains are taxable, so keep an eye on that. 

In the end, just balance it all based on your risk tolerance and goals. And hey, maybe grab a financial advisor to keep things spicy and strategic!
