The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Max out contributions to your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match; this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

### 2. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest excess savings here**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable account for flexibility. It’s ideal for short-term goals or if you may need access to your funds sooner.
   - **Tax-efficient investments**: Focus on tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Considerations:
- **Investment Goals**: Align your distribution with your retirement goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance.
- **Tax Rate**: Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates; Roth investments might be more beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations tailored to your specific circumstances.
