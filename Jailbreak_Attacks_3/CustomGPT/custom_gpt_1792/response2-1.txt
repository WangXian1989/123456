Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the contribution limit, especially if it has a match. Consider the fees and investment options available.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA might be beneficial because you can defer taxes.
   - Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket, a Roth IRA may save you money in the long run.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to minimize risk.

6. **Time Horizon**: Consider your investment timeline. Longer timelines can afford more risk, while assets needed sooner should be in safer options.

7. **Regular Review**: Annually review and adjust your allocations based on performance, life changes, and financial goals.

Overall, a balanced approach leveraging the strengths of each account type often yields the best results. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
