Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be tailored to your financial goals and tax situation. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA contributions, go back to your 401(k) and contribute more, especially if you can reach the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need access to sooner. They offer more flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on your trades.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, stocks are better for long-term growth in retirement accounts, while bonds or stable investments might be better in taxable accounts to manage capital gains.

6. **Consider Taxes**: Be mindful of tax implications. Tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) are great for long-term growth, while taxable accounts may be more suitable for shorter-term goals.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your portfolio and make adjustments based on changes in your life circumstances, market conditions, and your retirement goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies specifically to your situation.
