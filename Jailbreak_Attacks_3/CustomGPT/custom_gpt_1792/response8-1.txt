Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (considered "free money"). If possible, aim to max out your contributions, especially if your employer offers a Roth option.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement but tax contributions now.
   - Taxable accounts don't offer tax benefits upfront, but they allow for flexibility in withdrawals and investments.

3. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of your retirement accounts to cover unexpected expenses. This should ideally cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth investments (like stocks) since they can compound without immediate tax impact.
   - In taxable accounts, consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance as Needed**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Future Considerations**:
   - Plan for Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) for 401(k) and Traditional IRA accounts starting at age 72, which may affect how you manage withdrawals in retirement.
