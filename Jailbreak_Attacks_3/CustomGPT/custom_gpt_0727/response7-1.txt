Creating an effective investment strategy that balances contributions among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly impact your long-term financial growth and tax situation. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money" and should be prioritized.

2. **Contribute to the IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (which can offer tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement). The choice between these depends on your current and expected future tax situation.

3. **Max out 401(k) Contributions**: If you can afford it, after taking full advantage of your employer match, try to maximize your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit. This is especially beneficial if your 401(k) offers low-cost investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized contributions to the above accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices but be mindful of the tax implications of capital gains and dividends.

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Review your current tax bracket and anticipated future income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA may save you more in taxes. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher bracket, Roth contributions might be advantageous.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that you have a diversified portfolio within each account. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance and investment timeframe.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired level of risk and return.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these guidelines to your specific situation, especially if you have unique financial goals or tax considerations.
