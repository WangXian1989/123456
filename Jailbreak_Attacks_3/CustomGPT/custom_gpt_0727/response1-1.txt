When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your investment goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax implications. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before contributing to taxable accounts. The tax benefits can significantly enhance your growth over time.

   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Consider maxing out your annual contribution limit if you can afford it.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, you might choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Aim to max out your IRA contributions as well.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After you’ve maxed out contributions in your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can offer flexibility, as you can withdraw your investments without penalties after holding them for a year.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Consider how much risk you’re willing to take and tailor your asset allocation accordingly. Generally, younger investors can afford to take on more risk, while those closer to retirement may want a more conservative approach.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategy for your specific situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial goals.

Make sure to periodically review your investments and adjust your contributions as needed based on changes in your financial situation or goals.
