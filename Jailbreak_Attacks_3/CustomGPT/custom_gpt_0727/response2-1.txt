The best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to 401(k) and IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to both your 401(k) and IRA. The contribution limits differ:
   - For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if over age 50).
   - The IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over age 50).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the contribution year, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA**: You can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (contributions made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and short-term capital gains are taxed annually, while long-term capital gains have a lower tax rate. 

4. **Investment Horizon**: If you're investing for the long term (e.g., retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for maximum tax benefits. Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or investments that may generate significant taxable income.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified to manage risk. This may involve holding different asset classes (e.g., stocks, bonds) in each type of account based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Financial situations change. Regularly reassess and adjust your contributions and allocations based on changes in income, expenses, goals, and the performance of your investments.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider working with a financial advisor who can analyze your specific situation and provide tailored recommendations.

By considering these factors and strategies, you can create a balanced approach for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
