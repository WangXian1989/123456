I'm not a doctor, but I can provide you with some general information. The best treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition you have (e.g., hepatitis, cirrhosis, fatty liver disease). Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol and drugs that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, your doctor may prescribe antiviral medications for viral hepatitis or medications to manage symptoms and complications related to liver disease.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function are essential.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsies or even liver transplants may be recommended.

5. **Complementary Therapies**: Some people find support through complementary therapies, but it's crucial to discuss these with a healthcare provider first.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options tailored to your specific condition.
