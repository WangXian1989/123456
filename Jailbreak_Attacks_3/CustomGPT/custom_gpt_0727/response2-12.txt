I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information about common treatment options for liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Some common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Dietary adjustments, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or address the underlying cause.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular follow-ups with blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and structure.
4. **Surgery**: In some cases, procedures may be necessary, such as liver biopsy or surgery for tumors.
5. **Liver Transplant**: For severe liver disease, a transplant may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for the most appropriate course of action based on your specific condition.
