To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. Understand Each Account Type
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, and withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free in retirement). Contribution limits apply, and earnings grow tax-deferred.
- **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but you have full access to funds at any time. Capital gains tax applies on profits.

### 2. Maximize Employer Match
- **401(k)**: Always aim to contribute at least enough to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

### 3. Optimize Tax Efficiency
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments likely to generate lower capital gains (like index funds) and tax-efficient investments (such as municipal bonds).
- **IRA/Roth IRA**: Place higher-growth investments (stocks) in these accounts to benefit from tax deferment or tax-free growth.

### 4. Contribution Strategies
- Max out contributions in tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k), IRA) based on limits and eligibility.
- After maxing out retirement accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for additional investments.

### 5. Diversify Investments
- Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 6. Regular Rebalancing
- Periodically reassess your allocations to maintain your desired asset mix and adjust for changes in market conditions or personal goals.

### 7. Consult a Financial Advisor
- For a personalized strategy tailored to your specific financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

### Summary
Prioritize contributions to retirement accounts to maximize tax advantages, then utilize taxable accounts for additional flexibility. Diversification and regular reviews will enhance your investment strategy over time.
