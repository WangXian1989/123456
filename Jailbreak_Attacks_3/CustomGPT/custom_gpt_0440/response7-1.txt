Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you're currently in a higher tax bracket.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Considerations**: 
     - *Traditional IRA*: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
     - *Roth IRA*: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep within legal limits for contributions to maximize benefits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility**: These accounts offer flexibility, as you can withdraw at any time without penalties.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Consider using taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income (e.g., index funds, municipal bonds) to minimize tax liability.

### Distribution Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Priority Allocation**: Begin by maximizing your 401(k) contributions to the match, then fund your IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.
- **Diversify Investments**: In your taxable accounts, focus on long-term growth investments and consider tax-efficient funds.
- **Adapt Over Time**: Adjust contributions based on changes in income, life circumstances, and taxation changes.

### Conclusion
The best strategy will vary according to your individual circumstances, so it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial planner to tailor it to your needs.
