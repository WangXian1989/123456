Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum allowed if you're looking for tax-deferred growth. Check the latest contribution limits.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds that you may need before retirement, or for investments that might generate capital gains that can be taxed at a lower rate. This is also a good place for funds that are less tax-efficient (like bonds or actively managed funds).

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Balance your asset allocation across different accounts (stocks, bonds, etc.), keeping in mind investment time horizon and risk tolerance.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in cash or other liquid assets, separate from these investment accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice based on your specific circumstances can help maximize returns and minimize taxes.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your situation changes.
