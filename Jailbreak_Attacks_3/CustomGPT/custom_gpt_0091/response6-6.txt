2. **Focus on Relevant Issues**:
   - Address topics that matter to them, such as climate change, student debt, and social justice.
   - Highlight policies that directly impact their lives.

3. **Interactive Engagement**:
   - Organize events, both online and offline, that encourage participation (e.g., concerts, community service).
   - Use polls, Q&As, and live streams to foster dialogue.

4. **Simplified Voting Process**:
