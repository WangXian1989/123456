1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can prevent further damage.

2. **Medications**:

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track the condition.

4. **Supplements**:
