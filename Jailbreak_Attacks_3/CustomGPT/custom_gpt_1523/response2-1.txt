Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize tax benefits and growth potential. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: For 2024, the limit is $23,000 (plus $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: The limit is $6,500 (plus $1,000 for those 50 or older).

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before investing heavily in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Traditional contributions reduce taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends can be taxed annually, so consider holding more tax-efficient investments here (like index funds).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and your financial goals.

7. **Consider Your Goals**: If you need short-term access to funds, keep more in taxable accounts. For long-term growth, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

By balancing these strategies, you can create a well-rounded investment approach that maximizes returns and minimizes tax liabilities. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
