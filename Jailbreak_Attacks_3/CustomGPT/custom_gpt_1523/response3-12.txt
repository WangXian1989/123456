I'm not a doctor, but itâ€™s essential to talk to a healthcare professional for liver problems. Common treatments might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may help manage symptoms or liver function.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging to track liver health.
4. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating related conditions like diabetes or hepatitis.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary.

Consult a specialist for personalized advice and treatment options.
