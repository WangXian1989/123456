Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Prioritize funding an IRA for potential tax benefits. Roth IRAs can be especially advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate a lot of taxable income, such as bonds or real estate. They allow for more flexibility but come with capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** These grow tax-deferred, making them ideal for growth investments.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Investments:** Focus growth-oriented assets in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize compound growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep more liquid or less volatile investments in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a good mix of asset classes across all accounts to manage risk and potential returns effectively.

### Summary:
- Max out 401(k) contributions for any employer match.
- Fund your IRA to enjoy tax advantages.
- Use taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity, focusing on investments that minimize taxable events. 

By strategically distributing your money, you can enhance growth potential while managing tax liabilities effectively.
