To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA next. This gives you tax advantages either now (Traditional) or in retirement (Roth).

3. **Back to 401(k)**: Once youâ€™ve funded your IRA, return to your 401(k) and increase your contributions to the maximum allowed.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to a taxable account for flexibility and additional growth opportunities. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Place higher-growth (potentially more volatile) investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio annually to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
