Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, whereas a Traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After funding your IRA, continue maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money that you might need earlier or for long-term investments that benefit from lower capital gains tax rates, like stocks.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified mix of assets across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly assess your asset allocation and rebalance as needed based on performance and changing goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
