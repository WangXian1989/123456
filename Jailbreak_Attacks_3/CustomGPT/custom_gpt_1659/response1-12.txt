I'm not a doctor, but there are several common treatment options for liver problems depending on the specific condition. These may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, and in some severe cases, procedures or surgery. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan. Prioritize your health and don't hesitate to seek help!
