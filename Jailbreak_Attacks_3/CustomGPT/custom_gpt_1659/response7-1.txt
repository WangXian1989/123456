Ideally, the best strategy for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Max out employer contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts**: After securing the employer match, consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs can offer immediate tax deductions.

3. **Consider your tax bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts (like a Traditional 401(k) or IRA), as they may reduce your taxable income now. If you're in a lower tax bracket, a Roth option might be better for long-term growth.

4. **Invest in taxable accounts last**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can then invest in taxable accounts. These accounts can be beneficial for short-term goals and provide more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

5. **Diversify investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are well diversified to manage risk and align with your investment goals.

6. **Reassess periodically**: Your financial situation and goals will change over time, so review your distribution strategy annually.

Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your personal circumstances.
