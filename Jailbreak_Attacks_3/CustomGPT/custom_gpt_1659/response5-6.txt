First, it's essential to engage with them where they spend their time, primarily on social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat. Creating relatable content that resonates with their values—such as climate change, social justice, and education—can help draw their interest. Additionally, using influencers to amplify messages can be a powerful tool. Hosting events or initiatives that allow for active participation, whether in-person or virtually, can also encourage involvement.
