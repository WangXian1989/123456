When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing up to that match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. Consider maxing it out if you are in a higher tax bracket. 
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether itâ€™s a Traditional or Roth IRA, consider your current vs. future tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for goals that are shorter-term or for investments you may want to sell in the short run. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Horizon**: Place higher-risk, higher-return investments in accounts like the Roth IRA, where you won't be taxed on gains if held long term. 

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your money is diversified across different asset classes in each account type to balance risk and return.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before fully investing, have an emergency fund in place to avoid needing to withdraw from these accounts prematurely.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on your changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation. This ensures a strategy that considers your entire financial picture.
