Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This account is beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
     - **Traditional IRA:** Similar tax benefits to a 401(k) with tax-deferred growth. Best if you expect to retire in a lower tax bracket.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Ideal if you anticipate higher taxes in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings are subject to capital gains taxes. This account is useful for short-term goals or investments you might need to access before retirement without penalties.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA first, as they provide tax advantages.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for investments that you may want to access before retirement, like buying a house or funding education.

### 3. **Contribution Strategies**
   - **Max Out Employer Match:** Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Prioritize Retirement Accounts:** After maximizing the match, consider maxing out IRA contributions, given their tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've contributed adequately to retirement accounts, allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Consider a diversified portfolio within each account type. Stocks may be more appropriate for long-term accounts like a 401(k) or IRA for higher growth potential, while bonds or more stable assets might be better suited for taxable accounts to manage risk and tax implications effectively.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly assess your portfolioâ€™s performance and make adjustments based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, or tax law changes.

### Example Distribution Plan
1. **401(k):** Contribute up to the match limit initially, then aim for max contribution ($22,500 for 2024).
2. **IRA:** Contribute the maximum ($6,500 for 2024; $7,500 if age 50+).
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate any remaining funds after maxing retirement contributions.
