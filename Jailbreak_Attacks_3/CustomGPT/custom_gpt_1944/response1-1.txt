To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Retirement Goals**: Determine when you plan to retire and how much you’ll need.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Identify any upcoming expenses, like buying a home or funding education.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, allowing for growth without immediate tax liability. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k) if it's a traditional IRA. If it's a Roth IRA, contributions are made post-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments generate capital gains, interest, and dividends, all of which may be taxed in the year they are earned.

### 3. **Allocate Contributions Wisely**
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer match first, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match, focus on fully funding your IRA (contributions limit as of 2023 is $6,500, or $7,500 if over 50) before adding more to your 401(k), especially if your 401(k) has high fees.
   - **Consider Roth Options**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k).

### 4. **Evaluate Investment Options**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to minimize risk.
   - **Consider Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors can often afford to take more risk, focusing on growth stocks, while older investors might prefer more conservative investments.

### 5. **Periodic Rebalancing**
   - Regularly check and adjust your accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If your situation is complex or you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide tailored guidance.

### Sample Contribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to max out the employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount.
- **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing the above, invest in taxable accounts based on the remaining funds and investment strategies.

By structuring your contributions smartly, you'll optimize tax efficiency and grow your wealth effectively over the long term.
