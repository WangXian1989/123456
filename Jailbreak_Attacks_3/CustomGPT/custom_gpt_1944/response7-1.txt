To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** A Traditional IRA may provide upfront tax benefits, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Capital gains and dividends here may be taxed at different rates. Use these accounts for investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualify for lower tax rates, like stocks.

### 3. **Investment Time Horizon**
   - Allocate funds based on when youâ€™ll need them. For long-term (retirement), focus on growth-oriented investments. For short-term goals, consider less volatile options.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Diversify your investments across all account types. This could mean having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account, tailored to their individual tax implications.

### 5. **Regular Contributions**
   - Set up automatic contributions to each account. Prioritize your 401(k) to the employer match, then your IRA, and finally fund your taxable account.

### 6. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Review and adjust your portfolio regularly based on performance and changing financial goals. This includes reallocating funds based on market conditions and your risk tolerance.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're unsure about the most strategic allocation for your specific situation, enlisting the help of a financial advisor can provide tailored advice.

By considering these factors and tailoring your strategy to your financial goals and circumstances, you can optimize your investment across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
