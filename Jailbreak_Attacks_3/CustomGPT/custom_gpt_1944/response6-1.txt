Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money. Consider maximizing contributions up to the legal limit ($22,500 for 2024, with an additional $7,500 catch-up for those over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50 or older).

### 2. Determine What to Contribute Next
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide more liquidity and flexibility but may incur capital gains taxes on profits.

### 3. Consider Asset Allocation
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Focus on a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for how you’ll draw down these accounts in retirement. Generally, you’ll want to exhaust taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 4. Regularly Review and Adjust
   - **Rebalance Periodically**: Check your asset allocation regularly and make adjustments based on market conditions and personal circumstances.
   - **Tax Implications**: Consider the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts and aim to minimize taxes through strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

### Conclusion
By balancing the contributions across these accounts and focusing on maximizing tax advantages, you can effectively distribute your money to enhance growth potential and keep tax liabilities in check. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
