Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Pre-tax contributions can reduce your taxable income. However, withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA Accounts**: Depending on the type (Traditional vs. Roth), contributions may be tax-deductible now, or withdrawals may be tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains are taxed when realized. Focus on long-term investments to minimize tax impact.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance. Generally, you may want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable ones in taxable accounts.

4. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**:
   - For 2024, the contribution limits are $23,000 for 401(k)s (under 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (under 50). Adjust your contributions accordingly based on your financial ability.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you maintain an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts before maximizing contributions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances, particularly concerning tax strategies.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment approach tailored to your financial goals.
