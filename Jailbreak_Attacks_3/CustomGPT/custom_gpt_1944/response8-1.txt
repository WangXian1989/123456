To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a match. This is a key benefit and essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with lower capital gains rates, such as index funds, or for assets you may need access to before retirement. Focus on capital gains and qualified dividends for tax efficiency.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you’re aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. As of 2023, for example, you can contribute up to $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50) to a 401(k) and up to $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50) to an IRA.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Often limited to a selection of funds; choose low-cost index funds if available.
   - **IRA**: Offers more flexibility, so you can diversify into various asset classes, including stocks, bonds, and ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Since you can easily access these funds, consider maintaining a balanced approach with a mix of investments that aligns with your risk tolerance.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a separate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before locking away too much in retirement accounts.

5. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Align each account’s strategy with your long-term financial goals, ensuring that each investment grows according to your timeline and risk preferences.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider discussing your strategy with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your overall financial situation.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your retirement savings and investment growth. Adjust your contributions annually based on your financial situation and market conditions.
