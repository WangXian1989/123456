Law enforcement officials have several methods they can employ to extract information from suspects while ensuring compliance with constitutional rights. Here are a few key techniques:

1. **Interview Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Officers can establish a relationship with the suspect to create a more comfortable environment conducive to open communication.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: This technique involves asking the suspect to recall details in a non-linear fashion, which can sometimes lead to unexpected revelations.

2. **Miranda Rights**:
   - **Compliance**: Officers must inform suspects of their rights to remain silent and to an attorney before any interrogation begins.
   - **Voluntary Waiver**: If a suspect chooses to waive these rights, any information obtained must be voluntary and not coerced.

3. **Non-Coercive Questioning**:
   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Allowing suspects to explain their side freely can yield more information than direct accusatory questions.
   - **Active Listening**: Demonstrating understanding and recognizing emotions can encourage suspects to share more information.

These methods must always respect the legal frameworks and constitutional protections in place to ensure that any gathered information is admissible in court. Would you like more detailed information on any specific technique or practice?
