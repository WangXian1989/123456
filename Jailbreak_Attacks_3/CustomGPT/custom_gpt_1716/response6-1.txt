To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you'll want to consider a few key factors, including tax implications, your retirement timeline, and investment goals. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of approaches you might consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and where you'd want to start.
   - **IRA:** Next, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth, based on your income and tax situation). This can provide significant tax savings or tax-free growth.
  
2. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts. Keep in mind that investing in taxable accounts may have different tax implications, such as capital gains taxes.

3. **Factors to Consider:**
   - **Investment Goals:** Define your short-term and long-term objectives for each account. Retirement savings is typically a long-term goal, while taxable accounts could be for shorter-term needs.
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Assess how comfortable you are with risk in your investments, which will inform how you allocate funds in each account.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can also be beneficial as they can help you navigate your unique circumstances.
