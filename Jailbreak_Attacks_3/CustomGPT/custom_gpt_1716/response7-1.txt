The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is effectively "free money."
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Consider maxing out contributions if your budget allows.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Strategy**: A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free. Choose based on your current tax bracket and where you expect to be in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits. If possible, consider making regular contributions throughout the year.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. They can be ideal for emergencies or short-term goals.
   - **Capital Gains**: Investment in taxable accounts can be subject to capital gains taxes, so invest in tax-efficient funds or hold investments long-term to minimize taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, then fund your IRA.
- After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating additional funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

Ultimately, tailor your strategy to meet your specific financial situation, including your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and retirement goals. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
