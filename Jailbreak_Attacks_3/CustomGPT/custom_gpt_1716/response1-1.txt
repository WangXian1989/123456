To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match before focusing on other accounts. This is essentially free money!

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: After taking advantage of the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are generally more beneficial for those who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions are typically tax-deductible now but taxed during retirement withdrawals.
   - Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so placing investments with lower expected returns or frequent trading in these accounts may be wise.

4. **Invest in Tax-Efficient Vehicles**: For taxable accounts, consider holding more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize the impact of taxes on investment returns.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance across all accounts. Young investors might prefer more aggressive portfolios, while those closer to retirement might lean towards safer investments.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Make sure to review your allocation regularly and rebalance as needed to align with your goals and changing market conditions.

Ultimately, your specific financial situation, retirement goals, and risk tolerance will dictate the best approach for you. It's often a good idea to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
