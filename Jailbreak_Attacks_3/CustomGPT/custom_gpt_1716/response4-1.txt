To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to consider several factors including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider how much you can contribute to your IRA (both traditional and Roth options). These accounts offer tax advantages that can significantly impact your long-term growth.

3. **Debt Consideration**: If you have high-interest debt, it may be wise to focus on paying that down before aggressively funding retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified. Depending on your age, risk tolerance, and market conditions, you might want to adjust the investment mix in each account.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are useful for more flexible investing and may be favorable if you’re in a lower tax bracket or looking for liquidity. 

6. **Future Tax Strategy**: Consider what your tax situation will look like in retirement. If you think you’ll be in a higher tax bracket, prioritize Roth accounts. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower bracket, traditional accounts could be more beneficial.
