To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, you may want to contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since contributions are made with after-tax dollars.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After youâ€™ve taken advantage of the IRA, continue to put money into your 401(k). This is especially effective if you want higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you still have extra funds after maxing out your retirement accounts, consider putting money into taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility since you can access your money without penalties, but be aware of capital gains taxes on investments.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across different asset classes. Tailor your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically reassess your investments and rebalance as necessary to maintain your target asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the optimal distribution, it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your individual situation.
