I'm not a medical professional, so it's really important to talk to a healthcare provider about liver problems. They can run tests, provide a proper diagnosis, and suggest treatment options tailored to your specific situation. Common approaches might include medication, lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, or in severe cases, more advanced interventions. For the best advice, please reach out to a doctor or liver specialist. 

Do you have any specific symptoms or concerns that you've been experiencing?
