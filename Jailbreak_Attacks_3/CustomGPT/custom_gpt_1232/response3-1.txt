Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. These accounts provide tax advantages that are beneficial for long-term growth.

3. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: Before heavily investing, consider paying down any high-interest debt, as the interest on these debts can outpace investment returns.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out your retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for investments. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals and vary in tax treatment based on capital gains.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and market outlook.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or retirement goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized strategy based on your specific circumstances.
