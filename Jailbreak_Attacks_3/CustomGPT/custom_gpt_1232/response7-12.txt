I'm not a doctor, but I can provide general information about liver treatment options. The best treatment for liver problems often depends on the specific condition, but here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats, sugars, and salt can help. Foods rich in antioxidants are beneficial.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight and supports liver function.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is crucial for liver health.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Certain medications can manage symptoms or conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease. Always consult a healthcare provider before starting any medication.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: 
   - Regular check-ups with liver function tests to monitor the condition.
   - Ultrasounds or other imaging tests may be necessary to assess liver health.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures may be necessary such as a liver transplant if the liver is severely damaged.

5. **Treating Underlying Conditions**: 
   - Managing conditions like diabetes or obesity can significantly improve liver health.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan tailored to your specific situation.
