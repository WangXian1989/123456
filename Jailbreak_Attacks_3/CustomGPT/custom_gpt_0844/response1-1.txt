When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and Traditional IRA): Contributions reduce your taxable income, allowing your investments to grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes on profits and interest earned. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Allocate funds based on your investment goals. If you’re saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. If you have short-term goals, consider taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to reduce risk.

5. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type and try to maximize those limits if possible.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so regularly review and adjust your allocations as necessary.

It’s often a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
