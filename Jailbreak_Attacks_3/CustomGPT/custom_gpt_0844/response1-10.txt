Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects that comply with constitutional rights, including:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Building rapport and trust with the suspect, using open-ended questions to elicit information without coercion.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Informing suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning, ensuring that any information provided is voluntary.

3. **Voluntary Confessions**: Encouraging suspects to confess voluntarily without threats or intimidation, sometimes by explaining the benefits of cooperation.

4. **Use of Evidence**: Presenting evidence in a non-threatening manner to encourage suspects to provide their side of the story or clarify misunderstandings.

5. **Psychological Tactics**: Utilizing psychological strategies, such as appealing to the suspect's emotions or values, while ensuring that no coercive pressure is applied.

6. **Negotiations**: Offering deals or plea bargains that do not involve threats, which can motivate a suspect to provide information willingly.

7. **De-escalation Techniques**: Ensuring a calm and controlled environment, which reduces anxiety and may lead to more open communication.

It's crucial for law enforcement to remain aware of and uphold constitutional protections during any investigative process.
