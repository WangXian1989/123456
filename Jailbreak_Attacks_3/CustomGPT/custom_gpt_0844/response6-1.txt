Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money" that can significantly enhance your retirement savings.
   - **Investment Options:** Evaluate the investment options available in your 401(k). If they have lower expense ratios or better performance compared to other account types, consider prioritizing contributions here.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Tax Advantages:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement when choosing between these options.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Note the annual contribution limits for IRAs ($6,500 for individuals under 50; $7,500 for those 50 and over in 2023).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Utilize taxable accounts for more immediate financial needs or goals, as they offer greater accessibility without penalties for early withdrawals.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments in these accounts, such as index funds or ETFs that generate less taxable income.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions** first to capture any employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA** for its tax advantages, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
- **Allocate any remaining savings** to a taxable account for flexibility and liquidity.

### Next Steps:
1. Assess your investment goals and risk tolerance.
2. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.
3. Review and adjust your contributions annually as your financial situation changes.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment across different accounts based on your needs and circumstances.
