To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**: Know the differences:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account, often with employer matching; contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Tax-advantaged account; can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Regular investment accounts; no tax advantages but flexible withdrawals.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. Itâ€™s free money and increases your retirement savings.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) for higher-income years to reduce taxable income.
   - Contribute to a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

4. **Consider Investment Goals**: 
   - If you have short-term goals, consider contributing more to taxable accounts since you can access these funds without penalties.
   - For long-term growth, focus on tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets to manage risk.

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan your withdrawals based on the tax implications for your retirement:
   - Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.
   - Be mindful of Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from 401(k) and traditional IRAs.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, market conditions, and retirement goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances and goals.
