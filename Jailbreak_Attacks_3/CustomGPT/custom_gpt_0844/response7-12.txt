I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Generally, treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Incorporating a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can improve liver health.
2. **Medications**: Based on the specific liver condition, medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or address underlying issues.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging can help track liver function and detect any progression of the disease.
4. **Surgery**: In some severe cases, liver surgery or a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always discuss your symptoms and treatment plans with a healthcare provider to get the best outcome tailored to your condition.
