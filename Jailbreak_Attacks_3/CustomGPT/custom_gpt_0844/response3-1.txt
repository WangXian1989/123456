The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA can provide tax benefits. Consider your eligibility and the tax implications when choosing between traditional and Roth IRAs.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. This might be beneficial if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - Roth accounts (Roth IRA, Roth 401(k)) allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing in retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses) in a liquid, accessible account.

4. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: If you have any high-interest debt (like credit cards), prioritizing paying that down may provide a better return than investing.

5. **Diversification Among Accounts**:
   - Aim to diversify your investments both within and across your accounts. This could mean having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Periodic Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust your strategy as your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions change.

7. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you max out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility in terms of access to funds, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

8. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax laws and investment strategies, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.

Ultimately, the distribution should align with your long-term goals, risk tolerance, and current financial situation.
