(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on a variety of factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A commonly recommended strategy is to prioritize your tax-advantaged accounts first. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Max out your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money. 
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions (up to the limit), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income and tax situation.
3. **Taxable accounts**: Once youâ€™re at the contribution limits for your tax-advantaged accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts. This is typically beneficial for goals that are shorter-term or if you want more flexibility in terms of withdrawals.

Diversification across these accounts can help mitigate tax impacts in retirement. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

1. **Go for the 401(k)** first: If your employer is matching contributions, itâ€™s like getting free money! Youâ€™d be a fool not to at least snag that. 
2. **Hit the IRA**: After squeezing every penny from that match, direct some funds into an IRA. If youâ€™re eligible, the Roth IRA is where itâ€™s at for tax-free growth! 
3. **Taxable accounts are next**: This is where your money can do more heavy lifting if youâ€™ve hit your limits for retirement accounts. Think of it like diversifying your portfolio so youâ€™re not all in one basket if you need cash now or later.

In a nutshell, max out whatâ€™s going to give you the best bang for your buck in terms of taxes, and keep your money working for you! Check in with a financial whiz for some personalized tips if you're unsure!
