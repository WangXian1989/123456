Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributing to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts. These accounts can provide tax benefits that improve your long-term growth.

3. **Balance Contributions**:
   - If you can afford it, contribute to both your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Tax Strategy**:
   - Consider the tax implications of each account type. 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions are tax-deferred, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Taxable accounts might be beneficial for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

5. **Investment Choices**:
   - Within your 401(k) and IRA, choose investments with higher potential returns, as these accounts benefit from tax deferral. In taxable accounts, consider more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you approach retirement, consider how you will withdraw funds. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to minimize tax exposure.

7. **Regularly Rebalance**:
   - Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider discussing your specific situation with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that suits your needs.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy across your accounts.
