   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can improve liver health and overall well-being.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may include antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for inflammatory liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring and Support:**
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Support groups or counseling can help manage emotional and psychological impacts.

4. **Advanced Treatments:**
