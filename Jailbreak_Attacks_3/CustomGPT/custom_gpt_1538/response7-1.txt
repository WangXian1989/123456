Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. 401(k) Accounts
- **Maximize Contributions:** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Investment Choices:** Choose a mix of stocks and bonds according to your risk tolerance.

### 2. IRA Accounts
- **Traditional IRA:** If you're in a higher tax bracket now, consider contributing here for potential tax deductions. This can be beneficial for long-term growth.
- **Roth IRA:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later.

### 3. Taxable Accounts
- **Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for savings goals with shorter time horizons, or if you want flexibility in accessing funds.
- **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Invest in tax-efficient options like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy
1. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have 3-6 months’ worth of expenses saved in a high-yield savings account before heavily investing.
2. **Tax Considerations:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) first, then use taxable accounts. Reassess annually based on changes in tax laws and personal financial situations.
3. **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.

### Regular Review
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure alignment with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
