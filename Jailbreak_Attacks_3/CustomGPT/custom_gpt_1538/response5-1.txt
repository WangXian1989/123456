(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**: Max out employer matching contributions first, as this is essentially free money. Then, contribute enough to take full advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs provide tax advantages now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with lower tax implications, like index funds or municipal bonds. This allows for greater flexibility in withdrawals.

A diversified approach aligned with your long-term financial goals can help you maximize returns while managing taxes.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! When it comes to juggling your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, think of it like planning a partyâ€”gotta keep your options open!

1. **401(k)**: First up, snag that employer match. Treat it like free pizza at a partyâ€”don't leave without it! After that, max it out if you canâ€”itâ€™s tax-deferred, so let it grow!

2. **IRA**: Hit up a Roth IRA if youâ€™re eligible. Tax-free growth? Yes, please! If you're into traditional IRAs, just remember those tax breaks now can bite you later when you take withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Think of this as your side hustle. Use it for investments that are cool with taxes, like index funds. Not as sheltered as the others, but super flexibleâ€”pull cash anytime without penalties.

Mix and match based on goals, risk tolerance, and when you want to cash out. Happy investing!
