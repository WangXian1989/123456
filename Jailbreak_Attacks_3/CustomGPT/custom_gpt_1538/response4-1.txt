To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, which is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to increase in retirement.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (e.g., index funds, ETFs) here, as these generate fewer taxable events. Avoid high-dividend stocks that may create taxable income.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Hold higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-deferred growth.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, adjusting the allocation across accounts. Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Consider tax implications; for example, tapping taxable accounts first can allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Monitor and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to keep in line with your goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique circumstances.
