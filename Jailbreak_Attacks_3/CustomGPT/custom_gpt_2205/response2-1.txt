Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matching**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income. Ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Good if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for investments you may need before retirement age. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Generally taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** No taxes on qualified withdrawals.
   - Prioritize tax-efficient accounts for early withdrawals (like taxable accounts) to avoid penalties.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically assess your allocations and adjust based on life changes, market conditions, and investment performance.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** Max out employer match, then contribute to the IRA.
- **IRA:** Consider max contributions to either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for any additional savings or investments, focusing on tax-efficient investments like index funds.
