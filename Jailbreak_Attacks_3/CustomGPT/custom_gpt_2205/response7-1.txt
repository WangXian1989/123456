Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations to optimize taxes and growth potential. Here are some strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k) and IRA**: Try to maximize contributions to these accounts before investing in taxable accounts. Contributing the full amount can help reduce your taxable income.
- **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on the 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.

### 2. Prioritize Account Types
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: These accounts grow tax-deferred and are beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
- **Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may not benefit from tax-deferred growth, such as short-term trading or cash.

### 3. Asset Allocation
- **Growth vs. Income**: Hold growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can benefit from tax deferral. Use taxable accounts for income-generating investments (like bonds) to manage taxes on dividends and interest.
  
### 4. Consider Withdrawal Strategy
- **Withdrawal Order**: When you retire, consider the order of withdrawals: typically, you’ll withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (401(k), IRA), and lastly from Roth accounts.

### 5. Regular Rebalancing
- Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

### 6. Consult a Financial Advisor
- If your financial situation is complex, it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your goals.

Implementing these strategies can help maximize your investment growth while minimizing taxes over time.
