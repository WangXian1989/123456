Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**:
   - Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax bracket. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax advantages.

3. **Back to 401(k)**:
   - After maxing out your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) and contribute up to the annual limit if you still have funds to allocate.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - If you’ve maxed out retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This is useful for flexibility and access to funds before retirement age. Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Place investments that generate high taxes (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA), while keeping tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review and rebalance your investment portfolio regularly to align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 10% (enough to get the match)
- **IRA**: 10% (or max contribution)
- **Taxable Account**: 10% (after maxing retirement accounts)

### Final Tips:
- Adjust allocations based on age, financial goals, and risk tolerance.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
