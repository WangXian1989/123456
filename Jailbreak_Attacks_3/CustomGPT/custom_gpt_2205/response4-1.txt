Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth) as these accounts offer tax advantages. For 2024, the contribution limits are $23,000 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs, with catch-up contributions allowed if you are over 50.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide pre-tax benefits, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider these for flexibility, as you can withdraw funds at any time without penalties. However, you'll pay taxes on capital gains and interest.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that you have a balanced mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts. Consider using tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Longer-term investments should be in tax-advantaged accounts to allow for growth. Short-term savings might be better suited for taxable accounts.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically assess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice can help you optimize your specific situation.

Always consider your unique circumstances and changes in tax laws when making financial decisions.
