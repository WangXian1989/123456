Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Diversify Across Account Types**
   - **Tax Diversification**: Keep a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) growth to manage your tax liability in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that may generate less taxable income (e.g., index funds) or for short-term goals, as this allows for flexibility.

### 3. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy to minimize taxes in retirement. This may involve strategically withdrawing from tax-deferred accounts before tax-free accounts.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your investments and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For tailored advice, consider consulting a financial advisor. They can help you create a strategy that aligns with your unique financial situation.

### Conclusion
Your ideal distribution will depend on current and future income needs, as well as your overall financial goals. Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, maintain a diversified approach, and regularly reassess your strategy.
