Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

1. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; itâ€™s free money! Aim to max out contributions if possible, especially since contributions are tax-deferred.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After securing the match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax breaks on your contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating funds to a taxable investment account for more flexibility. This is especially useful if you plan to access funds before retirement age or want more investment options.

4. **Balance and Diversify**: Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and timeline. Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired allocation, which might involve selling higher-performing investments to buy underperforming ones.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Understand how capital gains taxes and withdrawal rules apply to each account. Utilize strategies like tax-loss harvesting in your taxable accounts.

Ultimately, your personal financial situation and goals should guide your distribution strategy. It might also be wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your needs. ðŸŒŸ
