Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline that can help:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, if your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money!

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) if you qualify. These accounts can offer tax benefits that help grow your savings more efficiently.

3. **Fund Your 401(k)**: Next, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you hit the contribution limits. If there are specific investment options or low fees in your 401(k), it can be beneficial to direct more funds here.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, you can start investing in your taxable accounts. They provide flexibility, as you can withdraw without penalties, though you'll incur capital gains taxes on profits.

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Assess your tax bracket and the tax implications of each account type. For example, if you expect your income to be higher in retirement, Roth accounts may be more beneficial.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Across all accounts, ensure that your investments are diversified to reduce risk. Different accounts may offer different investment options, so tailor them based on their respective tax implications.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations and invest according to any changes in your life circumstances or financial goals.
