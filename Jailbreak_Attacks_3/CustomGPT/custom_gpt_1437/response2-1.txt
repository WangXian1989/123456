Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** Consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Contributions to a Traditional 401(k) or IRA reduce your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - Roth accounts (401(k) and IRA) involve paying taxes now, but withdrawals are tax-free, which could be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to rise.

### 3. **Consider Liquidity Needs:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Keep some money here for short-term needs or emergencies since contributions and earnings can be accessed without penalties.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts but tailor your asset allocation based on the tax implications. For example, consider holding bond funds or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high taxes on the interest.

### 5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your strategy based on changes in income, financial goals, and tax laws.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of income (maximize employer match)
- **IRA:** $6,000 (or $7,000 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts:** 10% of income for short-term goals.

### Final Thoughts:
It's always wise to consult a financial advisor to personalize your strategy based on your unique situation and long-term objectives.
