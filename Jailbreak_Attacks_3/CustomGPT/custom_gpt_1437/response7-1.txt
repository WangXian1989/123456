To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money. Consider maxing it out if you can.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use this for investments that may trigger capital gains, such as ETFs or index funds, which generally have lower turnover and tax implications.
   - Consider keeping bonds in tax-advantaged accounts, as interest is taxed as ordinary income.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing asset allocation according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Review and rebalance periodically to ensure alignment with your investment goals.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, strategize withdrawals to minimize tax liability. Often, it’s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, tax-free accounts.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice and to optimize your tax situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

Keep your long-term goals and risk tolerance in mind while making these decisions.
