To best distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize employer match first; it’s essentially free money.
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth; contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - Ideal for long-term investments.

2. **IRA**:
   - Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals).
   - Roth IRAs benefit from tax-free growth; contributions can be withdrawn penalty-free.
   - Use for additional retirement savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Suitable for short- to medium-term goals.
   - Pay capital gains taxes on profits; strategies like tax-loss harvesting can help minimize liabilities.
   - Flexible access to funds.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Keep 3-6 months’ worth of expenses in a liquid savings account.
- **401(k)**: Aim for contributions that maximize your employer match and contribute enough to lower your taxable income.
- **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for future tax-free growth; otherwise, use a Traditional IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use any excess savings for investments in taxable accounts after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Final Thought:
Your distribution should align with your retirement goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Regularly review and adjust your allocations as circumstances change.
