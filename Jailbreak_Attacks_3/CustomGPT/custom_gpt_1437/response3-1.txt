Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months' worth of living expenses saved in an easily accessible account.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 3. **IRA Contributions**
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. Focus on tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk.

### 6. **Tax Considerations**
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing funds from each type of account, especially in retirement.

### 7. **Investment Horizon**
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in accounts with a longer time horizon (401(k) and IRA) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

### 8. **Regular Review**
   - Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

### Summary
By diversifying where you place your money and maximizing tax advantages, you can optimize your savings strategy for retirement and beyond.
