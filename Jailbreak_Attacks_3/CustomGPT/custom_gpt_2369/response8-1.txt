Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires a strategic approach considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here’s a breakdown to help guide you:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering current taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Self-directed, either traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals). Contribution limits apply.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No contribution limits, but investment income is taxed at capital gains rates.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on the 401(k), contribute enough to maximize this benefit first—it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA for tax advantages. Choose Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement or traditional if you expect to be in a lower bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or after-tax investments, especially if you’ve maxed out contributions in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider Growth Potential**
   - Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax benefits.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon**
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For mid-term goals (buying a house, funding education), consider a mix of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your portfolio allocation annually or semi-annually to ensure you remain aligned with your investment goals and adjust contributions accordingly.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice can optimize your strategy based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: 15% of income to max out employer match.
2. **IRA**: $6,000 annually (or $7,000 if over 50).
3. **Taxable Account**: Any remaining funds after maxing the above, adjusting based on need for liquidity.

By understanding the distinct roles of each account, you can create a robust strategy that aligns with your financial objectives.
