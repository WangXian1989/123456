Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a careful balance of tax efficiency, liquidity, and retirement goals. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the best approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money!). Aim for the annual contribution limit ($22,500 for those under 50, plus catch-up contributions for those 50+).
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth (assuming income limits allow).

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, so withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings here are subject to capital gains tax, so long-term investments are often more tax-efficient.

### 3. **Maintain an Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have liquid savings outside of these accounts for unexpected expenses, ideally covering 3-6 months of living expenses.

### 4. **Diversify Asset Allocation**
   - Within each account type, allocate investments according to your risk tolerance and goals (e.g., stocks, bonds, mutual funds).
   - Consider keeping more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts while placing bonds in tax-deferred accounts to minimize tax liability.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on market performance and personal circumstances.
   - Rebalance as needed to maintain your target asset allocation.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and understanding the tax implications of each, you can optimize your investment strategy effectively. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific financial situation.
