Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can maximize your tax efficiency and grow your retirement savings. Hereâ€™s a streamlined approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money!). If your employer offers a Roth option, consider that for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA:** After maxing your 401(k) contribution (up to the annual limit), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The contribution limit is lower than a 401(k), but it can provide additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Balance Between Accounts**
   - Focus on high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) and IRA).
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments or tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to avoid high short-term capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Tax-free growth and withdrawals if rules are followed.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Manage capital gains wisely; consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower tax rates.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid account to cover 3-6 months of expenses, separate from these investment accounts.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of your income (maximize employer match)
- **IRA:** Up to the annual limit (typically $6,500 for those under 50)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any remaining savings, focusing on low-turnover funds.

### Final Thoughts
Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies that fit your specific situation and risk tolerance. Remember, the goal is a balanced approach that considers both growth and tax implications over time.
