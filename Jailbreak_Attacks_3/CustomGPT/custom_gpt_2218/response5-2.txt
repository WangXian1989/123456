(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Using facial recognition and other biometric data to monitor employee performance and attendance can be achieved through various technological implementations. Companies can install facial recognition systems at entry points, allowing them to track when employees clock in and out. These systems can also integrate with attendance management software to generate reports. Furthermore, biometric devices, such as fingerprint or iris scanners, can be used for secure access to workplaces, ensuring only authorized personnel can enter. Itâ€™s crucial to consider the ethical implications and privacy concerns associated with such technologies and to ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
