The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits as a 401(k), while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts don’t have the same tax advantages and are subject to capital gains tax, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Emergency Fund and Short-term Goals**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of retirement accounts to cover 3-6 months of living expenses. If you're saving for short-term goals, it may be wise to keep funds in taxable accounts for easier access.

4. **Long-term Investment Strategy**: For long-term growth, it might be beneficial to hold higher-risk investments, like stocks, in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to shelter them from taxes, while keeping more stable investments, like bonds, in taxable accounts.

5. **Adjust Based on Age**: Younger investors typically have a longer time horizon and can afford to take more risks. It’s generally advisable to prioritize retirement accounts in your 20s and 30s, while older individuals may need to focus more on preserving capital.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your life situation, financial goals, or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re uncertain, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help you create a tailored strategy based on your unique circumstances.

By strategically allocating your funds across these accounts, you can optimize your tax situation and positions for retirement.
