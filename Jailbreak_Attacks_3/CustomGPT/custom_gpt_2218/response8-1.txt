The best approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and current income. Here are some guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. Itâ€™s essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts are often tax-deferred (traditional accounts) or tax-free (Roth accounts). 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax and income tax on dividends, so consider the tax impact when allocating funds.

3. **Prioritize Fund Growth**: If you have a long time horizon until retirement, focus on maximizing contributions to retirement accounts. If you're closer to retirement, you might want to allocate more funds to taxable accounts for liquidity.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of the account type. This can help minimize risk.

5. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50), and for IRAs, it's $6,500 ($7,500 for those 50 and older).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Emergency Funds**: Maintain an emergency fund in a liquid account to avoid having to withdraw from retirement accounts, which may incur penalties.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that suits your specific financial situation and retirement goals.
