Determining the best way to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some steps to consider:

1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** This is an employer-sponsored retirement account that often includes matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions (depending on income), while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement after contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are investment accounts that don’t have tax advantages. Capital gains, dividends, and interest are taxable in the year they are realized.

2. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Retirement savings is a long-term goal, while saving for a house or vacation might be short-term.

3. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers matching contributions to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere.

4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Utilize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to reduce your taxable income now or into the future.
   - If you’re considering a Roth IRA, think about your current tax rate vs. what you expect during retirement.

5. **Diversify Across Accounts:**
   - You can diversify investments across accounts to manage risk. For example, keep higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable income-generating investments in taxable accounts to manage taxes better.

6. **Balance Contributions:**
   - Allocate your savings considering annual contribution limits. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) and $6,500 to an IRA (extra for those aged 50+).

7. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation, investment performance, and overall financial situation to adjust contributions as needed.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If unsure, seek advice from a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that fits your unique financial situation.

Following these steps can help you effectively distribute your money among your retirement and investment accounts while considering both growth and tax implications.
