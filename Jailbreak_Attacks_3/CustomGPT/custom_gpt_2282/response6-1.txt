When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Balance Withdrawals and Contributions**:
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first.
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term needs or to take advantage of capital gains treatment.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts to maximize compound growth.
   - Hold bonds or other income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize current tax liabilities.

Balancing contributions to these accounts concerns your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. If you need personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor.
