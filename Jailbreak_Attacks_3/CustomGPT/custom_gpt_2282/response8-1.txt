To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. This allows your investments to grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement, prioritizing pre-tax contributions (like a traditional 401(k) and IRA) might be beneficial. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k).

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you have a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Taxable accounts can provide more flexibility since you can access the funds without penalty before retirement age. Keep in mind that investments in these accounts will be subject to capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Annually**: Review your asset allocation and adjust as necessary to maintain your desired balance between different types of accounts.

7. **Consider Age and Retirement Timeline**: The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative you might want to be with your investments, focusing on preserving capital.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy suitable for your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
