I’m not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific liver problem. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Reducing alcohol consumption to prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or control underlying causes such as hepatitis.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant might be necessary.

It's essential to have regular check-ups to monitor liver health and adjust treatments as needed. Always follow your doctor’s advice.
