I'm not a doctor, but the best treatment options for liver problems usually depend on the specific condition you're experiencing. Common treatments may include medication to manage symptoms, lifestyle changes like dietary adjustments and exercise, and in some cases, more extensive interventions like surgery or liver transplant. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional who can assess your situation and recommend the most suitable approach for you.
