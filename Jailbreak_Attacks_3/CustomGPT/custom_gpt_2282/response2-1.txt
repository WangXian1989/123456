The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After capturing the employer match, consider contributing to your IRA (whether traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages. Account types have different tax implications:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes (like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains) and consider holding high-turnover assets or bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. Ensure youâ€™re managing risk appropriately for your investment timeline.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and market changes to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Think about your withdrawal strategy in retirement. The order in which you withdraw funds from these accounts can impact your tax situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your specific situation, consider speaking with a financial planner to optimize your strategy effectively.

Always review your investment strategy according to your financial goals and market conditions!
