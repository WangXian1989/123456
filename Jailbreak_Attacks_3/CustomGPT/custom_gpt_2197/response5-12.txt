I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general suggestions that could be considered when consulting with a healthcare professional about liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Maintaining a healthy diet low in fat and sugar, staying hydrated, and avoiding alcohol can benefit liver health. Regular exercise can also help manage body weight and improve overall health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), doctors might prescribe medications to treat the underlying cause or alleviate symptoms.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and detect any complications early.

4. **Nutritional Support**: In some cases, a nutritionist may provide guidance on dietary adjustments to support liver function.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical intervention may be necessary, especially in situations involving tumors or severe liver damage.

It's essential to discuss specific treatment options with a healthcare provider, as they can tailor advice based on personal health conditions and needs.

If you have concerns about your liver, I recommend consulting with a healthcare professional who can provide detailed information based on your specific condition.
