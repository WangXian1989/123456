The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, focus on contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. 
   - Consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions if you’re looking for tax-deferred growth. The contribution limits can change, so make sure to check the current limits.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - After taking advantage of your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). 
   - A Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Any savings beyond your retirement accounts can be directed to taxable brokerage accounts. This is especially useful for goals that are short-term (like buying a home) or if you’re looking for flexibility in withdrawing money.
   - Keep in mind that investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies to minimize your tax burden.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

5. **Time Horizon**:
   - For longer-term goals (like retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For medium-term goals, consider a mix of tax-advantaged and taxable accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider working with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that takes into account your unique financial situation and goals.

Ultimately, the best approach often hinges on your individual circumstances, so thorough planning and strategy alignment with your goals are crucial.
