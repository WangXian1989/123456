I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional regarding treatment options for liver problems. They may recommend lifestyle changes, medications, or specific therapies depending on the severity and type of liver condition you have. It's important to get personalized advice tailored to your situation. Please seek medical attention for professional guidance.
