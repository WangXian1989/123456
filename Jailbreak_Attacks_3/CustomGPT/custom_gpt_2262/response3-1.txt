Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. 

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Use 401(k) and traditional IRA for high-growth investments since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Use Roth IRA for funds you expect to grow significantly as withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

### 3. **Account for Liquidity:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding more liquid investments or those you might need for short-term goals here. This also allows for more flexibility in accessing funds.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Adjust your investments based on risk tolerance across different accounts. For example, growth-focused investments may be better in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments can be placed in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

### 6. **Monitor Fees:**
   - Keep an eye on mutual fund fees or trading costs in taxable accounts and aim to minimize these costs wherever possible.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your unique situation, consider professional guidance.

This strategy can help optimize your contributions and potential growth while managing tax implications effectively.
