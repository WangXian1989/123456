Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a few key strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts first. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to your 401(k) and $6,500 to your IRA ($7,500 if you’re over 50). This helps minimize your taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, direct additional savings to taxable accounts. They offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider different investment selections for each account type based on tax implications. For example, hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts due to their interest income being taxed at ordinary income rates. 

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It’s always wise to consult a professional to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.

Balancing these accounts can help optimize growth and manage tax implications effectively.
