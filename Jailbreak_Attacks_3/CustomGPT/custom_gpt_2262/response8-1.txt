Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of employer matches, if available.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility) for tax benefits.

2. **Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions are often tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate income or capital gains, as these can be taxed at different rates.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investment strategy with your retirement timeline. Longer-term investments can withstand market fluctuations.
   - Consider the level of liquidity you need. Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified across accounts, not just individual ones, to manage risk effectively.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocation according to changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailor your strategy with professional guidance based on your individual circumstances and changing tax laws.

By adopting a balanced approach that considers these factors, you can optimize your money distribution effectively.
