Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Optimize your investments based on your risk tolerance and the options available in your plan.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Use a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions on contributions, especially if you're in a higher income bracket now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for shorter-term goals or investments that might generate significant taxable income, such as stocks that pay dividends.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains tax.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:

- **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have enough liquid savings for emergencies before allocating extra funds.
- **Employer Match**: Fund your 401(k) to at least the match amount.
- **Maximize IRAs**: Consider contributing to an IRA, prioritizing a Roth if eligible.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any additional savings, focusing on long-term investments for growth.

Ultimately, it's best to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
