To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Ideal for long-term growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Offers tax advantages. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible, with no contribution limits. You'll pay capital gains taxes on investment profits but have access to your funds at any time.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contribution, as this is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Prioritize these for high-growth investments to defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Tax-free Accounts (Roth IRA):** Best for funds you won’t need until retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for short-term goals or as an emergency fund due to liquidity.

### 4. **Aim for Maximum Contributions:**
   - If possible, aim to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first before investing heavily in a taxable account.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds) within each account based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 6. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust the allocation in each account to maintain your desired investment strategy.

### 7. **Long-Term Focus:**
   - Keep in mind your long-term goals, and consider how each account fits into your overall financial plan.

By balancing contributions based on these factors, you can optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. It’s also wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
