Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k). Aim to reach the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may be more time-sensitive or require liquidity, such as emergency funds or short-term goals.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts, but consider keeping high-growth investments like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize potential capital gains taxes.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.
