I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information on potential treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized evaluation and treatment plan. Common options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Modifications:**
   - **Dietary Changes:** Incorporating a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while reducing saturated fats and sugars.
   - **Regular Exercise:** Engaging in physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications such as antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring and Management:**
   - Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and check for progression of any underlying disease.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplantation might be considered.

Always seek professional advice tailored to your specific condition.
