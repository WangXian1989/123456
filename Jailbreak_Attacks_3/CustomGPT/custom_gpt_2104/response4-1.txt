To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs involve after-tax contributions but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxed annually, including dividends and interest. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 for those over 50), while IRA contribution limits are $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50).

3. **Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

4. **Investment Options**: 
   - Consider the investment options available in your 401(k) compared to your IRA and taxable accounts. IRAs often provide a wider range of investment choices.

5. **Time Horizon**: 
   - Your investment horizon impacts where to allocate funds. Generally, longer-term investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term funds may be better suited for taxable accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan ahead for how you intend to withdraw funds in retirement. Having a strategy for drawing down tax-advantaged accounts versus taxable accounts can help manage your tax liabilities.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to secure the employer match.
- Max out contributions to a Roth IRA if eligible, focusing on tax-free growth.
- Once the above limits are reached, you can redirect any additional savings to your taxable account for liquidity and flexibility.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor your strategy to your personal financial situation.
