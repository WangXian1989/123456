To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income during the contribution years. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax deductions for contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them suitable for those who anticipate higher future earnings.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Prioritize taking advantage of employer matching contributions in your 401(k) firstâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high capital gains or dividends, allowing for more efficient tax planning.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Max Out 401(k)** up to the employer match: Ensure you are receiving any free matching contributions available.
- **Contribute to IRA**: Maximize contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, considering your projected retirement tax bracket.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use any remaining funds for taxable accounts, focusing on long-term investments to minimizes tax impacts.

It's advisable to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your income, financial goals, and market conditions. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
