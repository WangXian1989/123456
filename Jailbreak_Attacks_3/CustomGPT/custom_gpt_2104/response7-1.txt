The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income level, tax bracket, retirement goals, investment options available, and your overall financial plan. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer-Matched Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to start building your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After you’ve maximized your 401(k) match, consider contributing to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). Both account types offer tax advantages that can significantly impact your long-term savings.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: If you are in a high tax bracket, prioritizing tax-deferred accounts (like a Traditional IRA or 401(k)) can be beneficial since you won’t pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, you might prefer contributing to a Roth IRA, where withdrawals are tax-free.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Strategically**: If you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and have additional savings to invest, you can turn to taxable accounts. Here, consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting to offset capital gains and be mindful of the impact of dividends and interest income.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Across all your accounts, ensure you’re maintaining a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. The mix can vary across accounts based on tax implications and the type of investment options available.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Monitor your accounts regularly and adjust contributions or investments as needed based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or retirement goals.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can offer personalized advice based on your unique financial situation and objectives.
