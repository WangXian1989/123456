1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This may involve dieting, exercising, and avoiding alcohol to reduce stress on the liver.
2. **Medications**: Depending on your specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to help manage symptoms or slow disease progression.
3. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and tests can be valuable for tracking liver health and adjusting treatment plans.
5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore herbal remedies or acupuncture; however, these should be discussed with a doctor.

Please see a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment tailored to your individual needs.
