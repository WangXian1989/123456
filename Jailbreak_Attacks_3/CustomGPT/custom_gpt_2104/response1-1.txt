To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals during retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and the account grows tax-deferred until retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed, but qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate assets among stocks, bonds, and other investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) can be more suitable for taxable accounts to minimize tax burden.

4. **Prioritize Accounts by Growth Potential**: Place high-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-free growth. Use taxable accounts for assets that generate regular income or those that are subject to a lower tax rate.

5. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of contribution limits for each account type. For the year 2023, for example, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

6. **Emergency Fund and Short-term Needs**: Maintain enough liquidity for emergencies outside of these accounts, ideally within a separate savings account or money market fund.

Some experts recommend a 60/40 or 70/30 split mostly allocated to tax-advantaged accounts, with the remainder in taxable accounts, but your specific distribution should reflect your personal financial situation, investment goals, and timeline for retirement.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
