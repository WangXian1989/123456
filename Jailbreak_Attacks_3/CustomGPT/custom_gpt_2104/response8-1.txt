The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute the maximum allowable amount, especially if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement. If you're eligible, contribute to it after maxing out your 401(k) match. 

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Funds in taxable accounts can be withdrawn without penalties, providing flexibility for mid-term goals. However, consider the tax implications of selling investments in your taxable account.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Typically, stocks should be held in tax-advantaged accounts for better tax efficiency, while bonds may be better suited for taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Review your investments periodically and adjust to align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personal preferences and circumstances vary greatly, so consider consulting with a financial advisor for a tailored strategy.

Remember, these are general guidelines; make sure to evaluate your specific circumstances before making investment decisions.
