Itâ€™s essential to consider several factors when deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general strategies that may help:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you qualify.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal. Useful for long-term savings.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can offer flexibility and easier access to funds but come with capital gains taxes on profit realizations.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Investment Goals**: Assess your risk tolerance and investment timeframe. You may choose to allocate more aggressive investments in taxable accounts where you can manage potential tax implications actively.

4. **Long-term Strategy**: Think about your long-term financial goals and how much liquidity you might need. Taxable accounts can provide more flexibility for short-term needs.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically check and adjust your allocations to ensure alignment with your investment goals and changing market conditions.

By considering these factors, you can create a strategy that aligns with your needs. Feel free to ask more specific questions or for clarification on any point!
