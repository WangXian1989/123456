When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth:** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Annual Contribution Limit:** Be aware of annual limits (e.g., $6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 for 2023).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Consider holding onto investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 4. **Overall Strategy**
   - **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Ideally, focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first before increasing contributions to taxable accounts.
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments within each account type, considering risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - **Adjust as Needed:** Review your allocations periodically (annually or after major life changes) to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this approach to your specific situation.
