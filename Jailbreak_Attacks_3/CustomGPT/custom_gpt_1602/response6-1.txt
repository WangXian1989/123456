Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your tax bracket.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 
   - Ensure that youâ€™re not overly concentrated in any single asset class.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) here to avoid higher taxes on interest and short-term gains.
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Balance your withdrawals to minimize taxes, considering Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations and tax situation. Adjust your contributions and investments based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice suited to your specific scenarios and goals.
