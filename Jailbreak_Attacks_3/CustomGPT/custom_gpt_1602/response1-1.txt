Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situations, and investment time horizon. Here's a general strategy:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Employer Match:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) at least up to the employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider maxing out if your employer offers good investment options.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Advantages:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth (after-tax contributions) or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Know the annual limits and the differences in tax implications for both types.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts allow for easier access to funds without penalties, making them great for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Capital Gains Considerations:** Be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains; consider tax-efficient investment strategies like index funds.

### Balanced Approach:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have a solid emergency fund before aggressive investing.
- **Diversification:** Diversify your investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Long-Term Sustainability:** Consider current and future tax implications and your retirement goals to adjust your contributions annually.

### Example Strategy:
- **Max out 401(k) (and employer match)**
- **Contribute to IRA (if eligible)**
- **Invest any remaining funds in a taxable account**

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
