Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you can, maximize your contributions to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if over age 50).
   - **IRA:** After your 401(k), consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. The contribution limit for 2024 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+). Decide between traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (post-tax) based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

### 2. **Assess Employer Match and Fees**
   - **Employer Match:** Prioritize funding your 401(k) to at least the match level, as it benefits your long-term savings significantly.
   - **Fees:** Look at the fees associated with your accounts and consider minimizing those by choosing lower-cost funds.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Strategy**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate little in the way of annual income (like growth stocks) to minimize short-term capital gains taxes. If you have assets that might appreciate heavily, consider putting them in a taxable account to enjoy long-term capital gains rates.
   - **Tax Loss Harvesting:** Manage your taxable accounts carefully, using losses to offset gains when possible.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**
   - Younger investors can afford to take more risks in growth-oriented investments in taxable accounts.
   - As you approach retirement, shift focus to more stable investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Keep an Eye on Withdrawal Rules**
   - **401(k) and IRA Withdrawals:** Understand the penalty-free withdrawal rules (usually at age 59Â½) and the required minimum distributions (RMDs) that kick in at age 73 for traditional accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Offer more flexibility for early withdrawals without penalties, making them useful for short-term needs.

### 6. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - Regardless of the account type, maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Summary
A balanced approach typically involves prioritizing contributions to 401(k) and IRA accounts for their tax benefits, then using taxable accounts for additional investments. Regularly review and adjust your distribution based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
