Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, prioritize this to maximize free money. Contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 2. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **High-Growth Assets in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Income-Producing Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Hold bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to efficiently manage taxes on interest and dividends.

### 3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Retirement Accounts**: Focus on long-term growth, as these funds are generally not accessible without penalties until retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short to medium-term goals, like saving for a house or vacation, where you may need quicker access to funds.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your investments and reallocate as necessary based on market conditions and changes in your personal financial situation.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Be aware of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts and avoid trading too frequently to minimize tax impacts.

### 6. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts, typically in a savings account for easy access.

### Conclusion:
Balance contributions based on your current tax situation, employer match, and growth potential, ensuring you're maximizing benefits from each account type. It may also be wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
