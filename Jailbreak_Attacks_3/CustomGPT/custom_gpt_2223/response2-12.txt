I'm not a doctor, but here are some commonly recommended treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit saturated fats, sugar, and salt.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying issues, such as antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease.

3. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from vitamin E or milk thistle, but always consult a healthcare provider before starting any supplements.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies may be necessary to monitor liver function and disease progression.

5. **Avoid Alcohol**: It's crucial to avoid alcohol, as it can exacerbate liver problems.

6. **Consult a Specialist**: A hepatologist (a liver specialist) can provide tailored treatment options based on your specific diagnosis.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
