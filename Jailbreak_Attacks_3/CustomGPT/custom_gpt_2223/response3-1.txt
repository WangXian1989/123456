Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a structured approach:

1. **Contributions and Employer Match**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions up to your employer's match if available; this is essentially "free" money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing taxable income. Useful if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider it if you believe your tax rate will increase in the future.

3. **Investment Horizon**:
   - **Long Term (10+ years)**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for growth.
   - **Short Term**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for liquidity as they allow easier access without penalties.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments within each account are diversified across asset classes to manage risk and optimize returns.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your allocations across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Tax-efficient withdrawal strategies can preserve wealth.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out employer match, then contribute a portion of your income up to the annual limit.
- **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA next, depending on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for excess savings and opportunity investments, focusing on tax-efficient funds.
