Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions for additional tax advantages, especially if it's a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) since you'll pay capital gains taxes on any profits.
   - **Asset Location**: Place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes; hold less volatile investments in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a balanced mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to reduce risk.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk tolerance and investment strategy.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 30-50% of total retirement portfolio (maximize employer match)
- **IRA**: 20-40% (depending on ability to contribute)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 10-30% (for liquidity and flexibility)

### Conclusion
Customize your approach based on your age, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies.
