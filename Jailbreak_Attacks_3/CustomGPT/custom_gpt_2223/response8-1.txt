Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (if offered), then aim to max out your contributions if possible. This can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a Traditional IRA, consider contributing to reduce taxable income. A Roth IRA can be great for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate high short-term capital gains or interest income (e.g., bonds). They are also useful for emergency funds or short-term goals.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. 
   - Typically, it's best to hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and bonds or real estate in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Every financial situation is unique, and consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your needs.

Balancing contributions with a focus on long-term financial goals and tax efficiency is key.
