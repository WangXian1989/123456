Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer matches contributions, prioritize this to maximize employer contributions. Aim to contribute enough to reach the full match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term:** For short-term goals (e.g., buying a house), prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity. For long-term retirement goals, focus on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Consider placing investments that generate high taxable distributions (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Investments:** Long-term investments can benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Consider Fees and Investment Options**
   - Review the fees associated with your 401(k) plan. If the fees are high, investing more in an IRA or taxable account with lower fees might be more beneficial.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure you diversify your investments across these accounts to manage risk.

### Suggested Allocation Framework
1. **Max Out Employer 401(k) Match**
2. **Contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions (up to the limit)**
4. **Fill Taxable Accounts with Excess Savings**

### Final Tips
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in income, or changes in your financial goals.
- Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
