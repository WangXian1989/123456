Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, age, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Focus**: If your priority is retirement, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA due to their tax-advantaged status.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: For goals within the next few years, prioritize taxable accounts for their liquidity.

### 2. **Understand Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are limited to $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older) for 2023.
   - **IRA**: Annual contributions are limited to $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No limits but consider tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

### 3. **Optimize Tax Benefits**
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: Depending on your current and expected future tax rates, choose between a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) or a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions).

### 4. **Evaluate Investment Options**
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment choices. Choose low-cost index funds or target date funds if available.
   - **IRA**: Typically offers a broader range of investment options. Consider diversifying across different asset classes.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for investments you may need access to sooner; focus on tax-efficient funds to minimize taxable events.

### 5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Allocate based on your risk tolerance; younger individuals might lean towards more aggressive investments (stocks), while those closer to retirement might prioritize stability (bonds).

### Sample Allocation Strategies
- **Aggressive Growth**: 60% 401(k), 30% IRA, 10% Taxable
- **Balanced Growth**: 50% 401(k), 30% IRA, 20% Taxable
- **Conservative Approach**: 40% 401(k), 40% IRA, 20% Taxable

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Periodically review your investments and adjust your contributions based on performance and life changes.

### Conclusion
Creating an optimal investment strategy involves balancing tax benefits, contribution limits, and your personal financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor may provide personalized insight tailored to your situation.
