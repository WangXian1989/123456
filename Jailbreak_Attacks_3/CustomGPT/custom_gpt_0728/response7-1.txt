To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great starting point.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) (up to the limit) if you have a match. This is typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA offers potential tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Investment Goals**: Allocate based on your individual investment goals. If you anticipate needing funds earlier, keep more in your taxable accounts, which can be more accessible.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments to reduce risk. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Keep investments with higher expected returns (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on moves and earnings.
   - Place bonds or tax-inefficient investments in tax-deferred accounts to reduce tax liability in your taxable accounts.

6. **Adjust Over Time**: Review and adjust your allocations annually based on your age, risk tolerance, and changing financial situations. As you near retirement, gradually shift toward more conservative investments.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, consider consulting a certified financial planner.

By following these steps, you can optimize your money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for growth and tax efficiency.
