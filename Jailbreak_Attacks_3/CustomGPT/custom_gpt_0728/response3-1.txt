Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here’s a structured approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching; offers tax advantages.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Personal retirement account with tax benefits; can be traditional or Roth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Regular investment accounts without tax advantages; flexibility in withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Your Financial Goals**
   - **Short-term (0-5 years):** Taxable accounts are ideal for liquidity.
   - **Medium-term (5-10 years):** Mix of taxable accounts and IRA contributions.
   - **Long-term (10+ years):** Maximize contributions to 401(k) and IRA, benefitting from tax-deferred growth.

### 3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income today.
   - **IRA:** Depending on the type, contributions may be tax-deductible or grow tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Subject to capital gains tax on profits.

### 4. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - If your employer offers matching contributions to your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”

### 5. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After meeting the match, prioritize contributing to your IRA. Aim for the maximum allowable contributions ($6,500 for those under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and over, as of 2023).
   - If you can max out these accounts, any additional savings can go into taxable accounts.

### 6. **Consider Investment Choices**
   - **401(k):** Investment options may be limited; focus on funds with low fees and good performance.
   - **IRA:** Generally offers a wider range of investments. Choose based on your risk tolerance and diversification strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

### 7. **Assess Risk Tolerance**
   - Adjust the percentage of your investment in each type of account based on your risk tolerance. Generally, growth assets like stocks can be favored in tax-advantaged accounts due to their long-term nature.

### 8. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your allocations periodically (annually or after major life events) to ensure they align with your goals and risk appetite.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get full employer match.
2. **IRA:** Max out contributions.
3. **Taxable Account:** Any additional savings can be directed here.

### Conclusion
This approach combines tax advantages with flexibility and investment growth, aligning with both short- and long-term financial goals. Tailor the distribution to your specific needs and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
