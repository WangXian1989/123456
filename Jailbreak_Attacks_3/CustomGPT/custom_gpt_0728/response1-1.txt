To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) to the maximum allowable amount, especially if you have a match. These contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deferrals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility with withdrawals, but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. 

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes, so consider placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in these accounts.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have enough liquid savings for emergencies before heavily investing in these accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that suits your specific goals and circumstances.
