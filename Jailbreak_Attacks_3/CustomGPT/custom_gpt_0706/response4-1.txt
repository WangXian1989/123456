It's generally advisable to focus on maximizing your retirement accounts first, like a 401(k) or IRA, which often offer tax advantages. Here's a basic strategy for distribution:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, aim to contribute the maximum limit.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing any employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can then allocate funds to taxable investment accounts. This is where you can invest in assets like stocks and bonds without the same limitations as retirement accounts.

Factors to consider when distributing money:
- **Tax implications**: Tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) and tax-free growth (Roth IRA) vs. taxable accounts.
- **Investment goals**: Retirement vs. short-term goals.
- **Risk tolerance**: How much risk are you comfortable with in each account based on age and retirement timeline.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
