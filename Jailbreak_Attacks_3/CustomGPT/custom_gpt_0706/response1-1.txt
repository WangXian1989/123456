Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money. After that, consider maxing it out if you can.
   - **IRA**: If you have additional funds, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for short-term goals and offer flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes when you sell investments.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

3. **Investment Goals and Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals (like buying a house), you might lean more on taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified and align with your risk tolerance.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed based on market conditions and personal circumstances.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy specific to your situation.
