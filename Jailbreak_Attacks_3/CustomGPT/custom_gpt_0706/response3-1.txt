Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. This will guide how much you should allocate to each account type.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money. Depending on your income, you might also want to consider maximizing contributions (up to the limit).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions depending on your income and contributions.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - Roth accounts are post-tax, meaning you pay taxes now but enjoy tax-free withdrawals later. Balance your contributions based on your current tax rate and expected rate in retirement.

4. **Diversify Within Accounts**: Regardless of how you allocate your money among accounts, ensure that you diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to mitigate risk.

5. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains that are lower than your ordinary income tax rate. Consider keeping fixed-income investments (bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts since they can be taxed at higher rates.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change. Rebalance your investments according to your risk tolerance and goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

Always consider your unique circumstances and goals, and remember to stay informed about the contribution limits and tax implications of each account type.
