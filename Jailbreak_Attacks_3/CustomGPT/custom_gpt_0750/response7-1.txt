The optimal way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often hinges on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - Maximize employer match: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - Contribution limits: For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). Aim to contribute as much as you can afford without compromising your budget.
   - Investment choice: Invest in a diversified mix of assets according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

2. **IRAs (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Contribution limits: For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). If you're eligible, it's beneficial to max out your IRA contributions after maximizing your 401(k) match.
   - Tax considerations: Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - Invest in growth-oriented or income-generating assets based on your retirement strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Flexibility: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - Tax efficiency: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Consider using tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize tax liabilities.
   - Diversify your investments as appropriate for your overall portfolio strategy, focusing on both growth and income generation.

### General Strategy:
1. Prioritize maximum employer contributions in your 401(k).
2. Max out your IRA contributions next, considering whether a Traditional or Roth IRA fits your situation better.
3. Use any remaining funds for taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 60% of your savings (max out or prioritize employer match)
- **IRA**: 30% of your savings (consider Roth vs. Traditional based on tax situation)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 10% of your savings (for short-term or diversified investments)

Ultimately, itâ€™s advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor an investment strategy that aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed over time.
