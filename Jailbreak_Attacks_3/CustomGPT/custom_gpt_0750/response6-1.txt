To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types and Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions; contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce current taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account; can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). Contributions may be tax-deductible, and Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes on sales, but flexible for withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. **Asset Allocation Based on Goals**:
   - **Retirement Focus**: Max out your 401(k) contribution, especially if thereâ€™s a match. Then, prioritize IRA contributions for additional tax-advantaged growth.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Hold high-growth or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and more stable investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you are aware of the annual contribution limits: max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions if possible. For 2023, consider the combined limits across all accounts.

### 4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and sectors to reduce risk while aiming for growth. Utilize low-cost index funds or ETFs to enhance long-term returns.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Review your asset allocation and adjust periodically based on market performance and any changes in your risk tolerance or financial goals.

By strategically distributing your money and understanding the nuances of each account type, you can optimize your investment strategy for both growth and tax efficiency.
