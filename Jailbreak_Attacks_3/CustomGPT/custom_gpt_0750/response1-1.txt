Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts ultimately depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if they offer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money" and should be prioritized. Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.

2. **IRA**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider funding a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA (depending on your eligibility and tax situation). Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may give you a tax deduction now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional investments. This is especially useful for short-term goals or if you've already maximized your retirement account contributions.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Aggressive Approach**: If you’re young and comfortable with risk, you might prioritize your 401(k) and taxable accounts for higher growth potential, while still contributing to your IRA.
- **Balanced Approach**: Aim for a mix of contributions across all three accounts, allowing for both tax advantages and liquidity.
- **Conservative Approach**: If you’re nearing retirement, prioritize your 401(k) and IRA, focusing on preservation and income generation.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals and capital gains in taxable accounts.
- **Investment Goals**: Align your investments in each account with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
- **Regular Review**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your allocation aligns with your goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor your distribution strategy to your specific financial situation.
