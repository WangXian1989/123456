The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some considerations:

### 1. **Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA** (Traditional or Roth): Maximize your IRA contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends are taxable, so be mindful of how often you trade and what assets you hold.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - By account type, you can hold different asset types. For instance, consider putting high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (where growth is tax-deferred), while holding income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

### 4. **Emergency Fund Considerations**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before allocating significant funds to investments.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across accounts. This reduces risk and can enhance returns over the long term.

### 6. **Review and Adjust**
   - Periodically review your allocations based on changes in market conditions, your financial goals, or life circumstances (like a job change or retirement).

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. Fund your 401(k) up to the match.
2. Max out your IRA contributions.
3. Allocate any remaining funds to your taxable account based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment strategies.

### Conclusion
Each person's situation is unique, so consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific goals and circumstances.
