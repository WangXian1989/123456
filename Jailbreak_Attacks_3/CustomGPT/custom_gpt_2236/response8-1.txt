Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit, especially if there's a match.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax strategy.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Youâ€™ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket then.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is a great option if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are suitable for short-term goals or if you need flexibility, but they come with capital gains tax implications.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are well diversified across all accounts to minimize risk.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help you craft a strategy tailored to your unique financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines while considering your personal situation, you can develop a balanced approach to distributing your investments.
