I'm not a doctor, but I can give you a general overview of treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your condition. 

Common treatment options might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can support liver health. 
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is essential for liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function are important.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver biopsy or even liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore herbal supplements, but these should always be discussed with a healthcare provider as they can sometimes worsen liver conditions.

Make sure to work closely with a healthcare provider who can guide you based on your specific diagnosis and health status.
