Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the maximum allowable limit, especially if there’s an employer match.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA or Roth IRA for tax advantages. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account. This should cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts for more flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your complete financial picture.

Balancing these accounts can optimize your tax situation and grow your retirement savings effectively.
