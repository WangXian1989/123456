Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like tax implications, investment goals, and your current financial situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments after maxing out tax-advantaged options. They provide more liquidity and flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.

### 3. **Consider Investment Goals**
   - Short-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts, while long-term goals can benefit from tax-deferred growth in 401(k)s and IRAs.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk and optimize returns.

### Tips:
- **Rebalance regularly** to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Consult a financial advisor** for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation. 

This balanced approach helps manage tax liabilities and supports your financial objectives effectively.
