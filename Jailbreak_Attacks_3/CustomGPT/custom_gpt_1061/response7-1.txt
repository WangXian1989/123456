Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Invest in Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match. Consider maxing it out if you have the financial flexibility.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider prioritizing contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, making them ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts are more flexible for withdrawals without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) appropriate for your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Investments inside a taxable account may incur taxes on gains, so consider using tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Debt Consideration**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before heavily investing in these accounts.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your distribution strategy based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and investment goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual circumstances.
