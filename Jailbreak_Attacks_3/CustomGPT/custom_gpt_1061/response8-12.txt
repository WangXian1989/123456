2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.
3. **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxins**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake can significantly aid liver recovery.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.
5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be considered.

Each treatment plan varies based on the underlying cause of liver issues, so professional guidance is essential.
