Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start with your 401(k). Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs give you tax-deductible contributions, which could be beneficial if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate ordinary income (like bonds) or short-term gains, which are less tax-efficient. Consider holding long-term investments here to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Invest in a diversified portfolio, aligning your risk tolerance and investment goals. Typically, higher-risk investments (like stocks) should be held in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable assets (like bonds) can be in taxable accounts.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Keep in mind that long-term capital gains are taxed more favorably. Consider holding growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts and interest-generating investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically and adjust as needed to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice considering your unique financial situation, it's beneficial to consult with a financial advisor.

This approach can help you create a balanced investment strategy while minimizing your tax liabilities.
