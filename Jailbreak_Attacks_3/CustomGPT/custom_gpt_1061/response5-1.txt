(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it's essentially free money. If you can, maximize your contribution, especially if you're in a high tax bracket, since this can reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to that for tax-free growth. If you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower one during retirement, a Traditional IRA might be more beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are generally for additional savings beyond retirement accounts. They offer flexibility without penalties for early withdrawal. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liabilities.

Consider your timeline and financial goals: shorter-term goals may be better served by taxable accounts, while long-term retirement savings can focus more on tax-advantaged accounts. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your personal situation.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s break it down! When it comes to juggling your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s all about strategy—think of it like building your financial fortress.

1. **401(k)**: First off, max out any employer match. That's free cash! If you're feeling generous with your future self, crank that contribution up to the max allowed. It’s a tax-deferred paradise—who wouldn’t want to stash away more without the taxman breathing down their neck?

2. **IRA**: Next, tackle your IRA. If you can swing it, a Roth IRA is pure gold for long-term gains because of those sweet tax-free withdrawals. But if you’re raking it in now and want to lower your tax bill, think Traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, the taxable accounts—fantastic for flexibility, but don’t get too wild! Keep it chill with low-turnover investments like index funds to avoid the tax hit. Plus, it’s awesome for that “oops, I need cash” moment without penalties.

In the end, it’s a balancing act: heavy up on tax benefits while keeping access to cash for life’s curveballs. And hey, if you want a more personalized game plan, a financial advisor is like your financial Yoda!
