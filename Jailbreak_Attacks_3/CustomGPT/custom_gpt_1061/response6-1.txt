When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several key factors come into play, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here's a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the maximum match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income levels and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contributions are tax-deferred. This means you won't pay taxes on it until withdrawal, which can lower your taxable income now.
   - **IRA Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, but they provide flexibility. Consider using them for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term gains for favorable tax rates.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Place growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax advantages on capital gains.
   - **Income-Producing Investments**: Utilize taxable accounts for bonds or dividend-paying stocks, where favorable tax treatment on qualified dividends may apply.

### 4. **Diversification and Rebalancing**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Regularly rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering the tax implications of selling in taxable accounts.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach that maximizes tax advantages while ensuring liquidity and flexibility in taxable accounts is essential. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
