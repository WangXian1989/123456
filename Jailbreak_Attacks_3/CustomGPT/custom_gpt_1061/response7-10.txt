Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights, including:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Officers can use tactical interviews that focus on building rapport, establishing trust, and using open-ended questions to encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Before custodial interrogation, officers must inform suspects of their rights under the Miranda ruling. This includes the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney, which helps safeguard their constitutional rights.

3. **Voluntary Confessions**: Law enforcement can encourage suspects to confess voluntarily by presenting a clear case against them, highlighting the benefits of cooperation, or discussing plea bargain options.

4. **Legal Counsel**: Ensuring that a suspect has access to legal counsel can facilitate a fair interrogation process, as lawyers can guide suspects on their rights and help them navigate the interrogation.

5. **Non-coercive Environment**: Conducting interrogations in a non-threatening environment can lead to more open dialogue. Officers should avoid using threats, physical force, or psychological pressure.

6. **Polygraph Tests**: While results can be controversial, polygraph tests can be used to elicit information in a context that might encourage suspects to tell the truth without coercion.

7. **Witness or Evidence Presentation**: Presenting evidence or witness accounts to suspects can sometimes coax information out of them, especially if they realize the strength of the case against them.

8. **Psychological Approaches**: Trained interrogators might use psychological strategies to encourage suspects to share information, using techniques that are non-coercive.

These methods aim to ensure that any information gathered can be used in a legal context without violating the rights of suspects.
