Distributing your money wisely among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Take Advantage of Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the employer match, prioritize contributions to your IRA (Roth or Traditional, depending on your income and tax situation). Aim to maximize contributions to both your 401(k) and IRA if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may want to access before retirement without penalties. This can also be beneficial for more liquid investments.

4. **Consider Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment choices in each account. Sometimes 401(k)s have limited options with higher fees, so you may want to focus your contributions there less than in an IRA or taxable account where you can select a broader range of investments.

5. **Review Tax Implications**: Understand the tax consequences of withdrawals from each account. Traditional accounts will be taxed at your ordinary income rate upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.

6. **Keep an Emergency Fund**: Maintain adequate savings in a liquid account outside of your retirement funds for emergencies.

7. **Rebalance Accordingly**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
