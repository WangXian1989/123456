Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on a few key factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing the maximum allowed, as contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These are useful for financial goals that are shorter term, as they provide more liquidity and flexibility.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking to a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.

Each individual's financial situation is unique, so tailor this strategy to your own needs and priorities.
