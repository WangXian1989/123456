Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Prioritize contributions to these accounts due to their tax advantages. If you can, maximize contributions to both. For the 2023 tax year, the contribution limits are:
     - 401(k): $22,500 (plus $7,500 catch-up if you're over 50)
     - IRA: $6,500 (plus $1,000 catch-up if over 50)
   - Choose between traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax) options based on your current tax rate versus expected future rate.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains/losses, such as stocks or funds, which can be more tax-efficient. Consider holding bonds or high-dividend investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax exposure.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside, ideally covering 3-6 months of expenses. This fund should be in a readily accessible account and not tied up in your investment accounts.

5. **Diversification and Risk Assessment**: Evaluate your risk tolerance and diversify your portfolio to minimize risk while aiming for growth. This might involve balancing equities, bonds, and other assets based on your age, risk tolerance, and goals.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your long-term goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy that suits your financial goals.

By considering these steps, you can effectively distribute your investments across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to work towards your financial objectives.
