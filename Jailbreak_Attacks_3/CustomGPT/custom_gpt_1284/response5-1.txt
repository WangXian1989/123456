(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Generally speaking, it's advantageous to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. Consider the following:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute at least enough to receive the full match.
2. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute to your IRA up to the limit, and continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowed.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After youâ€™ve maximized contributions within tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest additional funds in taxable accounts. Be mindful of tax implications when selecting investments for these accounts.

It's important to assess your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and overall financial plan before making decisions.

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer's got that sweet match, you gotta grab it. Free money doesn't grow on trees!
2. **IRA Next**: After you've maxed out that employer match, hit up your IRA. Think of it as a tax-free playground for your cash.
3. **Taxable Accounts Last**: Only once you've squeezed every last drop from those tax-advantaged accounts should you dive into the murky waters of taxable accounts. Keep in mind, decisions here can hit you with capital gains tax like a ton of bricks! 

Balance is key, and donâ€™t forget to review your strategy periodically. Keep it smart, and you'll be stacking up dough in no time! ðŸ’°
