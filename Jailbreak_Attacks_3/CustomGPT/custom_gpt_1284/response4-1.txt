Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: 
   - Consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - If you qualify, prioritize contributing to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA for tax-free or tax-deferred growth.

2. **Balance contributions**: 
   - After maximizing employer matches in your 401(k) and contributing to an IRA, you can allocate additional investments to your taxable account for more flexibility and to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

3. **Consider your tax bracket**: 
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritizing tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRAs) may provide short-term tax benefits.

4. **Withdrawal strategies**: 
   - Plan for how and when you'll need to access your funds. Taxable accounts may be better for short-term needs, while tax-advantaged accounts are better for long-term goals like retirement.

5. **Re-evaluate regularly**: 
   - Market conditions and personal circumstances change, so periodically review and adjust your allocation strategy.

Itâ€™s also wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your unique situation.
