Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your match:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit, especially if it has lower fees than other accounts.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer potential tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in a taxable account. This can provide more flexibility in terms of accessing your funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each type of account, consider your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind the tax implications of your investments. For instance, place bonds and other income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure you’re aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized distribution strategy based on your individual circumstances.

Each person's situation is unique, so these steps should be tailored to your specific needs and financial goals.
