Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA**: Once you’ve maximized the employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The type of IRA depends on your current tax rate compared to what you expect in retirement:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

### 3. **Contribute Beyond the Match**
   - Continue to contribute to your 401(k) after maxing the match, focusing on maximizing your annual contributions.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for any additional savings once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged contributions. This allows for greater flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

### 5. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**
   - Balance your investments based on the account type:
     - **401(k)**: Often limited in investment options, focus on a diversified portfolio.
     - **IRA & Taxable Accounts**: More investment choices, allowing for strategic asset placement (e.g., higher growth assets in tax-free accounts).

### 6. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions, and adjust contributions as necessary.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide specific recommendations based on your individual circumstances.

By prioritizing contributions effectively, you can optimize your savings and tax efficiency for retirement.
