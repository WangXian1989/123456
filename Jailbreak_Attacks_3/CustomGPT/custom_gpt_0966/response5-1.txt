Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; this is essentially “free money.”
   - Consider maxing out your IRA if you qualify (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

2. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside in a liquid account before heavily investing in other vehicles.

3. **Tax Implications**: 
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.
   - Consider holding bonds or REITs in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high tax rates on income.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes in all accounts to manage risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - For personalized advice tailored to your situation, a financial advisor can provide valuable insights.

Ultimately, the best strategy depends on your individual circumstances and future goals.
