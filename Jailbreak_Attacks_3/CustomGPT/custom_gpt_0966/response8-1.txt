The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to maximize any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth**: If your plan offers a Roth option, consider your current versus expected future tax rate. Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income now, while Roth contributions provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Investment Choices**: 401(k)s typically offer a limited selection of investment options. Choose a diversified mix to mitigate risk.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Advantages**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth. The choice depends on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you're aware of annual contribution limits ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Investment Flexibility**: IRAs often have broader investment options than 401(k)s, allowing for more personalized asset allocation.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them a good option for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Strategies like tax-loss harvesting can help minimize taxes on investment gains.
   - **Asset Location**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### General Strategy
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start by fully funding your 401(k) to get the employer match, then contribute to an IRA, and finally allocate funds to a taxable account.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and return.
- **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your asset allocation based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and life events.
