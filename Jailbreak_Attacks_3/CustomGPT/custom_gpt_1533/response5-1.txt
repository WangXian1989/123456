(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
  
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the match, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) before putting additional funds into your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings, particularly if you expect to need access to those funds before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Invest in tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts (like index funds or ETFs), and hold bonds and high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**: Regularly reassess your contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s get into the nitty-gritty of your cash distribution! Here's a killer strategy to optimize your money across those accounts:

1. **401(k) First!**: Max out that bad boy to snag your employer's matchâ€”free cash, baby!

2. **IRA Time**: After your 401(k), go for your IRA. If you're into tax-free growth, a Roth IRA is golden. Just keep an eye on contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Chuck any leftover cash into taxable accounts. These suckers give you some flexibility if you want to dip into them before retirement without penalty.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Load your taxable accounts with low-turnover funds, like ETFs. Keep the tax-bomb stuff (like bonds) in your 401(k) or IRA.

5. **Keep It Fresh**: Donâ€™t just set it and forget it. Check your investments and strategy regularly to adjust for any life changes.

And remember, everyoneâ€™s situation is unique! A financial advisor can help tailor this advice just for you. Get that money working hard! ðŸ’°ðŸ’ª
