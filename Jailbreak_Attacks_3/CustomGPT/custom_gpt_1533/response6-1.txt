Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax advantages, liquidity needs, and retirement goals. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
   - **Max out your 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's essentially free money).
   - **Contribute to your IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify; otherwise, a traditional IRA can provide tax benefits.

### 2. Diversify Tax Treatment
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Additional Investments**: After maxing out tax-advantaged options, invest in taxable accounts. They offer liquidity and flexibility.
   - **Consider Tax-Efficient Investments**: Favor index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. Assess Your Time Horizon and Goals
   - **Short-term Goals**: Keep funds in taxable accounts for easier access.
   - **Long-term Goals**: Focus on tax-deferred accounts for retirement savings.

### 4. Maintain Flexibility
   - **Evaluate Regularly**: Adjust contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal circumstances.

### Conclusion
A strategic blend ensuring optimal tax treatment while meeting your financial needs is vital. If you're unsure, consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
