To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. Ideal for long-term growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs give you tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term investments or when you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and goals. Typically, stocks for growth, bonds for stability, and REITs for income.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically check your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid penalty withdrawals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies based on your unique situation and financial goals.

This approach helps optimize tax advantages while aligning with your retirement and investment objectives.
