Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be a good option for goals in the near term (like buying a house) since they allow for flexible withdrawals. However, keep in mind the tax implications on capital gains.

### 3. **Balance Your Investments:**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a diversified mix of bonds and stocks suited to your age and retirement timeline.
   - **IRA**: Use for investments that might be more tax-sensitive (like higher growth stocks, since the gains aren’t taxed until withdrawal).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs).

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside before heavily investing.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Revisit your distribution strategy annually, adjusting it based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

### Example Distribution (Adjust Based on Your Needs):
- **401(k)**: 15%-20%
- **IRA**: 10%-15%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 5%-10%

### Conclusion:
Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your unique situation. They can help navigate specific tax laws and investment strategies.
