Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and should be your first priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - After maximizing the match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). IRAs often have more investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Fund Your 401(k) to the Limit**:
   - If you have additional funds available, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This reduces your taxable income and grows your savings tax-deferred.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**:
   - If youâ€™ve maximized contributions to your retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts provide flexibility for accessing funds before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Balance Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Diversify your investments within each account type.

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains in taxable accounts may be taxed at a lower rate.

7. **Regular Reassessment**:
   - Review your strategy periodically to adjust based on changes in income, expenses, goals, and market conditions.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
