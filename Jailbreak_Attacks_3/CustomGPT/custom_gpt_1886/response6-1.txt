The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks), which benefit most from tax deferral.
   - Place more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Keep investments that will grow over time, deferring taxes until withdrawal.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Ensure some funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs, since withdrawals from retirement accounts may incur penalties.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Adjust your asset allocation periodically based on performance and changing goals.

This strategy should help optimize tax efficiency and align with your financial objectives. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
