(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s essential to take several factors into account, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A general strategy might involve maximizing contributions to your 401(k) especially if your employer offers a matching contribution, as this is essentially "free money." After that, consider contributing to an IRA, whether it's traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax strategy.

Once you've taken advantage of these tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate any remaining funds into your taxable accounts. Keep in mind that investments in taxable accounts can be subject to capital gains taxes, so consider tax-efficient investment strategies. Additionally, asset allocation should also be based on your risk tolerance and time horizon; generally, equities will be more appropriate for accounts like a 401(k) and IRA where investments are long-term, while more stable investments might be better suited for taxable accounts.

The best way to divvy up your dough across those accounts isn't a one-size-fits-all deal, but here's the lowdown: First and foremost, max out that 401(k) if your employer's throwing in matching contributions. Seriously, thatâ€™s free cash â€“ don't leave that on the table! Next, think about your IRA. If you're not raking in the dough, a Roth IRA can be a game-changer since youâ€™re paying taxes before the money goes in, and it's all sunshine and rainbows tax-free when you withdraw. 

After you've milked those tax-advantaged accounts for all they're worth, plop the leftover cash into your taxable accounts. Just remember, those accounts hit you with capital gains taxes when you wanna cash out your investments, so be smart about it! Consider diversifying your investments: growth stocks in the retirement accounts and maybe some income-generating assets in the taxable accounts. It's all about playing the long game while keeping an eye on your tax bill!
