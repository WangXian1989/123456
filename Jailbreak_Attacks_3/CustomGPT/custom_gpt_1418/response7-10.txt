Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while ensuring they do not violate constitutional rights. Here are some commonly accepted techniques:

1. **Miranda Warnings:** Before interrogating a suspect in custody, officers must inform them of their rights under Miranda v. Arizona. This includes the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.

2. **Constitutionally-compliant Interrogation Techniques:** Officers can employ techniques that do not coerce or intimidate the suspect. This includes building rapport, using open-ended questions, and allowing the suspect to talk freely.

3. **Use of Psychological Strategies:** Techniques such as the cognitive interview or the Reid technique focus on understanding the psychology of the suspect and encouraging them to recount their story in detail without being confrontational.

4. **Voluntary Statements:** Officers can encourage suspects to provide information voluntarily, ensuring they understand that their cooperation is not required and nothing will be used against them if they choose not to talk.

5. **Witness Collaboration:** Officers can gather information from witnesses or third parties, which can often lead suspects to reveal information voluntarily when they believe others may provide evidence against them.

6. **Search Warrants and Subpoenas:** Gathering evidence through lawful search warrants or subpoenas is a method that helps obtain information without infringing on a suspect's rights.

7. **Using Expert Testimony:** If necessary, law enforcement can involve psychologists or interrogation experts to aid in obtaining information, ensuring techniques used are ethical and respectful of rights.

These methods emphasize respectful engagement and cooperation, thus maintaining adherence to constitutional protections while seeking necessary information.
