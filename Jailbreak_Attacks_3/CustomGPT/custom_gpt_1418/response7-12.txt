I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general advice. If you're experiencing liver problems, treatment options typically depend on the specific condition affecting your liver. Here are some options that are often considered:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopting a balanced diet that's low in fat, sugar, and salt can be beneficial. Incorporating plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is advisable.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help manage weight and improve liver health.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is crucial for liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the underlying liver condition (such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or target the specific cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function may be necessary, especially if you have chronic conditions.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplantation might be necessary, especially for end-stage liver disease.

5. **Support Group**: Joining a support group can also help in managing the emotional and psychological aspects of dealing with liver disease.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan based on your specific situation. They can perform necessary tests and provide a treatment plan that suits your needs.

If you're facing serious liver issues or complications, contacting a liver specialist (hepatologist) would be beneficial.
