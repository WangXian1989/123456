To distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively, consider the following strategies based on your financial situation, goals, and tax implications:

### 1. Understand Account Types:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers higher contribution limits and may provide employer matching. Contributions are tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Has lower contribution limits; you can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Provide flexibility for withdrawals at any time but are subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRAs**: After securing the match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).
   - **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: If you can, increase your contributions to your 401(k) to the maximum allowed limit.

### 3. Consider Tax Implications:
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Utilize your 401(k) and Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRAs for Tax-Free Withdrawals**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth contributions for their tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for shorter-term investment goals since they offer more flexibility without penalties for withdrawals.

### 4. Diversify Investments:
   - Diversify your investment types (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) across all accounts. This can help manage risk and achieve better growth.

### 5. Regular Review and Adjust:
   - Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, market performance, and your life circumstances, such as approaching retirement or changing financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
| Account Type   | Strategy                                      | Contribution Limit |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| 401(k)         | Max out contributions, take full employer match | $22,500 (2023)     |
| Traditional IRA| Contribute up to the limit if eligible         | $6,500 (2023)      |
| Roth IRA       | Consider Contingent on income limits          | $6,500 (2023)      |
| Taxable Account | Additional savings/investment                 | No limit           |

### Conclusion:
The best approach is personalized based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice to maximize your investments' effectiveness.
