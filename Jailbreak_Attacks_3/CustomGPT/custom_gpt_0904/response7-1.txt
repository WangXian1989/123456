Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach you might consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if one is offered. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding an IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now with taxes owed on withdrawals later.

### 3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**
   - Once your IRA contributions are maxed out (if applicable), continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This offers tax-deferred growth.

### 4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**
   - If you still have funds after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, consider a taxable brokerage account. While this is not tax-advantaged, it offers flexibility.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Goals and Risk Tolerance**
   - Balance your investments according to your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Younger investors might lean towards more aggressive investments, while those closer to retirement might prioritize capital preservation.

### 6. **Evaluate and Rebalance**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your goals and market conditions.

### Summary:
1. Contribute to 401(k) to get the match.
2. Fund an IRA.
3. Max out your 401(k).
4. Allocate excess funds to taxable accounts.
5. Adjust based on goals and risk tolerance.
