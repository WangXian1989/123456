Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially “free money.” If you're under 50, consider maximizing your contribution limit.
- **IRA**: If eligible, fund a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Diversification and Liquidity
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate short-term income or if you foresee needing liquidity. Prioritize investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or tax-managed funds.

### 3. Balance Risk Tolerance and Investment Goals
- Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. Typically, growth-oriented investments are suitable for retirement accounts, while more conservative investments may be suited for taxable accounts if you need liquidity.

### 4. Consider Tax Implications
- Place high-growth, high-income investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.
- Use taxable accounts for investments with lower turnover or qualified dividends that benefit from favorable tax treatment.

### 5. Regular Rebalancing
- Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market changes.

### Conclusion
Your optimal distribution will vary based on your unique financial situation. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor the strategy to your specific needs.
