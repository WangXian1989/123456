Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free" money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **401(k)**: If youâ€™re aiming for higher contributions later, after your IRA, continue to max out your 401(k).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds here are more flexible but also subject to capital gains taxes. Use these for investments that might have high turnover or dividends to avoid hefty taxes in your tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investment across these accounts. Generally, hold more tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts and more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Retirement Age**: The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative your investments may need to be, influencing your allocation among different accounts.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings outside of these accounts before heavily investing.

7. **Review Regularly**: Monitor your allocations and adjust based on performance, changes in income, or tax laws.
