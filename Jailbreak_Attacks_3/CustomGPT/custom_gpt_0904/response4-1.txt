Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—they essentially give you free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Fill Remaining 401(k) Contributions**: Once you’ve maxed out your IRA contributions (if possible), continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the contribution limit for the year.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: If you have leftover funds after maxing out retirement contributions, consider taxable accounts. These provide flexibility and access to your money without penalties before retirement age.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Think about the tax implications of each account type:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deferred, taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions taxed, withdrawals tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains tax applies on earnings.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocation and adjust as your circumstances and goals change.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor an investment strategy specific to your needs and situation.

This approach helps ensure you’re taking full advantage of tax benefits and optimizing your investment growth over time.
