The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: 401(k)s generally have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs, so consider maxing out contributions if feasible.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions (depending on income levels), while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Diversification**: Use IRAs to diversify investments that may not be available in your 401(k) plan.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts provide more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals without penalties (unlike retirement accounts).
   - **Investment Choices**: These accounts can hold a wider variety of investments, which can be useful for strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

### General Strategy:
- **Contribution Priority**: Start by contributing to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then fund any IRA (Roth or Traditional), and finally, allocate funds to taxable accounts.
- **Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment time horizon to determine how to diversify your investments across these accounts effectively.
- **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of capital gains and qualified dividends in taxable accounts, and look to hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) there.

### Final Thoughts:
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies based on your unique financial circumstances and goals.
