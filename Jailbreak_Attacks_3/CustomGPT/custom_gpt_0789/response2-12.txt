I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. However, common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while avoiding alcohol and fatty foods can significantly aid liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may be prescribed to address conditions such as hepatitis or fatty liver disease.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help monitor the condition and effectiveness of treatment.

4. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but consult a doctor before starting any.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment tailored to your needs.
