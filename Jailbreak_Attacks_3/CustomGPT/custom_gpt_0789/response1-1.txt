When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline for retirement. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions lower your taxable income for the year. Prioritize maxing out to the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider a traditional IRA for tax-deduction benefits or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (depending on your eligibility).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’re maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, or if you have liquidity needs, you may consider investing in taxable accounts. This is especially useful for funds you may want to access before retirement age without penalties.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough cash in an emergency fund separate from investment accounts—typically 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Diversification**: Distribute your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Every individual's situation is different, so it's essential to review your financial plan regularly and adjust your investments as necessary.
