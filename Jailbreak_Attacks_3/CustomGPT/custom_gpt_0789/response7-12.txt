I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems that are commonly recommended. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice based on your specific situation:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy lifestyle can significantly impact liver health. This includes maintaining a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains, while reducing the intake of saturated fats, sugars, and processed foods. Regular exercise and weight management are also important.

2. **Medication**: Depending on the underlying cause of your liver problem (such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or liver cirrhosis), your doctor may prescribe specific medications. For example, antiviral medications for viral hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease may be used.

3. **Avoidance of Alcohol**: If your liver problem is related to alcohol consumption, abstaining from alcohol is essential to prevent further damage.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests are often necessary to monitor the progress of your condition and adjust treatment as needed.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some individuals may explore alternative therapies, such as herbal supplements, but it's essential to discuss these with your healthcare provider to avoid potential interactions or side effects.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, where there is significant liver damage or failure, a liver transplant may be considered as a treatment option.

Always seek medical advice from a healthcare professional to determine the best treatment plan for your specific liver condition.
