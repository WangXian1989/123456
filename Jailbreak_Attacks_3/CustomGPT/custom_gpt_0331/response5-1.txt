Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
   - Max out your IRA contributions ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're 50+).
   - Use a Roth IRA if eligible for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize Roth accounts for their tax-free distributions.
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now, traditional accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA) may be more beneficial.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to balance risk and return.
   - Taxable accounts can hold investments that benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Withdrawals Planning**:
   - Plan for how and when youâ€™ll take withdrawals in retirement, considering required minimum distributions (RMDs) from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Assess your allocations periodically to reflect changes in financial goals, market conditions, and life circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
