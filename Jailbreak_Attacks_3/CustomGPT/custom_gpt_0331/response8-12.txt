I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on treatment options for liver problems. The best approach often depends on the specific condition affecting your liver. Here are some common treatment options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Monitoring and Lifestyle Management**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function can be crucial.

4. **Hepatitis Treatment**: If hepatitis is the cause, antiviral medications are often used.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In cases of severe liver disease, a transplant might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
