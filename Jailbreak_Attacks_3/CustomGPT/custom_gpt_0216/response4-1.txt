To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies, keeping in mind your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizons. 

### 1. Assess Your Financial Goals:
   - **Retirement Planning**: Prioritize contributions to accounts that offer tax advantages for retirement, such as a 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Short-term Needs**: If you need access to funds in the next few years, you might want to focus more on taxable accounts, as they allow withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it during retirement. Employers may offer matching contributions, which can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), but has different contribution limits and eligibility based on income. Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes upon sale. They provide flexibility for withdrawals, making them useful for emergency funds or non-retirement goals.

### 3. Establish Contribution Priorities:
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match before moving to other accounts.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If you’re eligible, contributing to an IRA can provide additional tax advantages. Consider maxing out contributions when possible.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for further investment, especially for short- to medium-term goals.

### 4. Diversify Your Investments:
   - Spread your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider asset allocation strategies that can be tailored to each account's tax efficiency.

### 5. Review and Adjust:
   - Regularly reassess your allocation strategy based on changes in tax laws, personal circumstances, and market conditions.
   - Rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Conclusion:
The best way to distribute your money will depend on your unique financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that aligns with your long-term objectives and to ensure you’re making the most tax-efficient choices.

Happy investing!
