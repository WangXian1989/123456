Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach to maximize tax efficiency and investment growth. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions, grow tax-deferred, and taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Similar to 401(k) for Traditional (taxed on withdrawal) and tax-free withdrawals for Roth (contributions are after-tax).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments taxed on capital gains and dividends, offering flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider IRAs:** Next, consider contributions to a Roth IRA if eligible, as it provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Focus on higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA), as these can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Bonds:** Consider placing bonds or other income-generating investments in taxable accounts to limit interest rate risk in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a diversified investment approach across all accounts. Each account should align with your overall risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for retirement withdrawals to reduce taxes. Start with taxable accounts to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 6. **Regular Review:**
   - Periodically assess and rebalance your investments in all accounts based on performance and changes in financial goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personalized advice can help create a tailored strategy that considers your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these principles, you can optimize your investment allocation across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for long-term financial growth.
