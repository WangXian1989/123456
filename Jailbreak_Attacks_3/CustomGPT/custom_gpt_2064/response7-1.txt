Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRAs** (Traditional or Roth): After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you qualify, Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize these for funds you may need before retirement or for investment flexibility.

### 3. **Investment Strategies**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth with a diversified portfolio since these accounts have tax advantages. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets suited to your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Implement a strategy that considers capital gains tax. Favor investments with lower turnover, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize short-term capital gains.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - When planning for withdrawals in retirement, prioritize accounts based on tax implications. Typically, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio based on changing personal goals, market conditions, and tax implications.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice from a financial professional can help tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation.

By balancing contributions to these accounts based on your specific circumstances, you can optimize your investments and prepare effectively for retirement.
