To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money and provides immediate returns.

2. **Utilize Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Focus on this first, especially if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). The choice between them often depends on whether you expect your tax rate to increase in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These are flexible but come with capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diversified asset allocation in all accounts. This helps manage risk and maximize returns. Generally, equities can be suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds may be better for taxable accounts due to lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Think ahead about how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Understanding the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type can affect how you save now.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If your situation is complex, it may be beneficial to get personalized advice tailored to your financial goals and tax situation.

This balanced approach can help maximize growth while managing tax liabilities effectively.
