To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions for tax deferral.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - Hold more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts to manage tax impact more efficiently.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Pay attention to the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.
   - If you expect your tax rate to increase in retirement, prioritize contributions to Roth accounts.

4. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - Periodically review your portfolio and contributions. Adjust based on performance, life changes, and market conditions.

5. **Diverse Investments**:
   - Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to mitigate risk.

This strategy should be tailored to your financial goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights.
