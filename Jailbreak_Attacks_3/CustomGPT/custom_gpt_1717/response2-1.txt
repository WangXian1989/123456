To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is free money!

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Choose between a traditional IRA (like a 401(k), tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax. It's best to hold more tax-efficient assets here (like index funds or ETFs).

3. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Your investment strategy should reflect your age and comfort level with risk. Younger investors might favor stocks, while those closer to retirement may focus more on bonds and safer assets.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Make consistent contributions to each account to benefit from dollar-cost averaging.

6. **Periodic Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

7. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investments with long-term objectives, whether it's retirement, buying a home, or other financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
