To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k):**
   - Maximize employer matching contributions first; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Focus on tax-advantaged growth for your long-term investments.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be more beneficial. 

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for short-term goals or investments that generate taxable income.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **General Tips:**
   - Assess your retirement goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon before allocating funds.
   - Diversify investments across asset classes to manage risk effectively.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
