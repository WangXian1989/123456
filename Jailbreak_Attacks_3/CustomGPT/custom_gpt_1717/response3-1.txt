To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Are you saving for retirement, a house, or another large purchase?

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: Check the annual contribution limit and employer match.
   - **IRA**: Know the contribution limits for traditional and Roth IRAs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No limits, but consider tax implications on capital gains.

3. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match (if available) as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Max out contributions to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA if eligible, depending on your tax situation.

4. **Evaluate Investment Options**:
   - Compare the investment choices available in your 401(k) versus your IRA. Often, IRAs have a wider selection.

5. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Balance risk and growth according to your age and risk tolerance. Generally, younger individuals can afford more risk.

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on gains.
   - Consider holding bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts for favorable tax treatment.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your distribution strategy based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

8. **Consult a Professional**: If you're unsure, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.

This balanced approach can help you maximize your investment growth while managing tax implications effectively.
