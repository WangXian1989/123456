To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement; otherwise, a traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now.

### 2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Funds you may need within the next 5 years should be held in taxable accounts or high-yield savings.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Allocate more to your 401(k) and IRA for tax-deferred growth, which can compound significantly over time.

### 3. **Diversify Investments Within Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Choose a mix of equity and bond funds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Consider index funds or ETFs for low fees and diversified exposure.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as municipal bonds or broad-market index funds to limit taxable impacts.

By prioritizing your contributions strategically and tailoring your investment choices to your goals, you can optimize your overall financial growth and tax efficiency.
