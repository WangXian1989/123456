To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize your contributions, especially if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money. Focus on tax-deferred growth by utilizing a mix of stock and bond funds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA**: Aim to max out contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains). It's also a good place for more liquid investments or to hold money for short-term goals.

**General Guidelines**:
- Balance your asset allocation across all accounts.
- Consider tax implications for withdrawals.
- Review your investments regularly to adjust as your goals change.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 30%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable**: 40%

Adjust percentages based on personal financial goals and market conditions. Consulting a financial advisor could provide personalized insights tailored to your situation.
