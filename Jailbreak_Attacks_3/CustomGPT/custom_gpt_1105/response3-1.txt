The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA** accounts typically offer tax benefits. Contribute to these accounts up to the annual limits before investing in a taxable account.
   - Max out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) contributions if you can. For 2024, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

### 3. **Choose Between Traditional and Roth Accounts**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) or IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth 401(k) or IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider your current vs. future tax rates.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for assets you plan to use before retirement, or for investments that may generate a lot of taxable income (like bonds).
   - Keep funds for emergencies or short-term goals in a taxable account.

### 5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 6. **Reassess Periodically**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on your changing financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can take your entire financial situation into account.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- If you have a total of $15,000 to invest:
  - Allocate $6,000 to your 401(k) for the employer match.
  - Allocate $6,500 to your IRA.
  - Use $2,500 in a taxable account for short-term goals or emergencies.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to managing your investments across different account types.
