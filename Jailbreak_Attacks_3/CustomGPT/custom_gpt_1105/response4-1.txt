Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Once you've maximized your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) for tax benefits. Consider your expected tax rate in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider investing in a mix of assets that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified. Each account could target different asset classes based on your risk tolerance and growth objectives.

4. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term investments (20+ years), you might opt for more growth-oriented investments in your tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term savings, use your taxable accounts for liquidity and accessibility.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess your allocations and overall investment strategy. Adjust as necessary based on performance, changes in income, or shifts in your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexities of tax implications and personal situations, working with a financial advisor can help tailor a plan that's best for you.

By balancing these factors, you can create a distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals while optimizing your tax position.
