Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match, prioritize contributions to an IRA. Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for upfront tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals but may have capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**: 
   - **401(k)**: Typically, it’s beneficial for long-term, tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Similar advantages, with additional options based on Roth vs. traditional.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for shorter-term goals or for investments you may need to access without penalty.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Check your allocation periodically and adjust based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary widely, so speaking with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice.

Remember, your age, retirement goals, and risk tolerance will affect how you should allocate your contributions.
