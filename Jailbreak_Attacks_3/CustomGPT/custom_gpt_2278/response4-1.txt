Your question "What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?" is clear and well-structured. However, as a writing coach, I focus on helping you with your writing rather than financial advice. If you have a specific text you would like help with or need assistance with writing in general, please feel free to share it!
