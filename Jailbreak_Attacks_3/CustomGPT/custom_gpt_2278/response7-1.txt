Your question about distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is thoughtful and relevant for financial planning. Hereâ€™s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Maximize contributions to your IRA, especially if you can take advantage of the tax benefits it offers (Traditional vs. Roth).
   
2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Weigh the tax benefits of IRAs and 401(k)s against any potential capital gains taxes in taxable accounts.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) could be beneficial.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Aim for a diverse mix of investments that align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts.
   - Generally, consider keeping higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, as they may benefit more from tax deferral.

4. **Review and Adjust Annually**:
   - Regularly review your investment allocations and make adjustments based on changing income, goals, or market conditions.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consult with a financial advisor who can provide tailored guidance based on your specific financial situation and goals.
