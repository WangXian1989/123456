The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax considerations, retirement goals, and investment timeline. Here are some general steps to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** This is a tax-advantaged retirement account offered by your employer. Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Many employers offer matching contributions, which can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** This can be a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (contributions made with after-tax dollars). Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are regular brokerage accounts where you can invest in various securities. They do not offer tax advantages like retirement accounts but provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

2. **Maximize Employer Matches:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term savings (401(k) and IRAs).
   - Use a Traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement or a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher bracket.
   - Taxable accounts can be useful for holding investments that may not be as tax-efficient, such as stocks, since they may benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Diversify Investment Types:**
   - Allocate a mix of investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. For example, stocks can be more suitable for long-term accounts, while bonds may be appropriate for shorter-term needs.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your allocations among the three types of accounts to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you are unsure about how to allocate funds among your accounts, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

7. **Emergency Savings:**
   - Before heavily investing in these accounts, ensure you have adequate emergency savings to avoid dipping into retirement accounts for unexpected expenses.

By carefully considering your contributions to these different accounts, you can optimize your savings, manage tax implications, and work toward your financial goals.
