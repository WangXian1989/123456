It's essential to think about your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon when deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some tips to help you structure your investments effectively:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If you're contributing to a 401(k) and your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Efficient Investment Strategy:** Typically, it's advisable to place more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, in your taxable accounts, while placing higher-yield investments (such as bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRAs) to defer taxes.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:** If you're in a lower tax bracket, you might benefit from contributing more to a Roth IRA, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. Conversely, if you're in a higher tax bracket, traditional accounts like a 401(k) or traditional IRA may be beneficial to reduce your taxable income now.

4. **Diversify and Rebalance:** Ensure your investment portfolio is diversified across all accounts, including stocks, bonds, and other assets. Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Long-Term Goals:** If you have long-term goals (e.g., retirement), prioritize maxing out retirement accounts before investing heavily in taxable accounts. 

6. **Emergency Fund:** Maintain an adequate emergency fund in a liquid account, separate from these investment accounts for unforeseen expenses. 

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:** If you're unsure how to best allocate your funds, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy to your specific financial situation.

By assessing your unique situation and financial goals, you can create a balanced investment strategy that maximizes your savings potential while taking into account the tax implications and investment growth for your future.
