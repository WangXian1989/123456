(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first, as they offer benefits like tax deferred growth or tax-free distributions. Here are some tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if one is offered, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can be placed in taxable accounts. These might be beneficial for more flexible access to your funds without the rules surrounding retirement accounts.

Always consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your personal circumstances.

Start by maxing out that 401(k) if your employer has a matchâ€”it's basically free cash! Next, dive into your IRA; Roth or traditional depends on how much you want to be taxed now versus later, but don't skip it! Once you've milked those tax advantages dry, throw in whatever you can into a taxable account for flexibility. Just keep an eye on those taxes, 'cause Uncle Sam loves to take a bite of your investments! Ultimately, mix it up according to your risk tolerance and goals.
