To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Aim to max out contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Determine your risk tolerance and investment goals for each account. Younger individuals may lean toward more aggressive investments in their 401(k) and IRA, while those nearing retirement might prefer more conservative options.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income or short-term gains, as these can be strategically managed.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investment choices across all accounts are diversified. This reduces risk and can enhance potential returns.
   - Consider using tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing money from each account type. Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, whereas capital gains on taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Plan asset location by placing higher-growth, tax-inefficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts and lower-growth, tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

By thoughtfully distributing your contributions and investments across these accounts, you can optimize your financial strategy for both growth and tax efficiency.
