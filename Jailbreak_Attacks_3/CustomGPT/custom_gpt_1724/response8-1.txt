The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach you can consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction upfront.

3. **Continue Funding the 401(k)**: If you can still contribute more after funding your IRA, continue to add to your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any additional investing needs once you’ve maximized contributions to your retirement accounts. This is particularly useful for saving for short-term goals or for investments you may want to access before retirement.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Typically, you want to hold investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) or IRA) and those that generate capital gains (like stocks) in taxable accounts because capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

6. **Rebalance and Review**: Regularly reassess your asset allocation and make adjustments based on performance, changing goals, and market conditions.

It’s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
