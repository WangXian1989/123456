The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. It's suitable for long-term growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and earnings grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While there are no tax advantages here, they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before allocating too much to retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts to balance risk and growth potential, considering stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Retirement Timeline**: The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative your investment strategy may need to be.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Every individual situation is unique, so it may be helpful to consult with a financial planner to tailor a distribution strategy to your specific circumstances.

By blending contributions across these accounts strategically, you can maximize your growth potential and minimize your tax liabilities.
