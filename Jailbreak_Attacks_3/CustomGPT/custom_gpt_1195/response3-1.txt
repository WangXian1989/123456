The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money!

2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional IRA:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA (contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals are tax-free). If you need tax deductions now, a traditional IRA might be better.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need to access before retirement age or if you want more flexibility in trading.

4. **Balance for Growth and Safety:** Ensure a mix of growth-focused investments (stocks) and safer bonds based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Rebalance Based on Goals:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If youâ€™re unsure, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your personal situation.

Always remember to consider your long-term financial goals and the potential tax implications of each account type! Happy investing! ðŸ’°ðŸ“ˆ
