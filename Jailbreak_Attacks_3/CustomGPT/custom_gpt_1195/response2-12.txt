I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general advice. For liver issues, treatment options often depend on the specific problem. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Avoid alcohol and reduce intake of processed foods.
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition, doctors might prescribe medications to manage symptoms or underlying causes (like antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Natural Supplements**: 
   - Some people find milk thistle or turmeric helpful, but consult your doctor first.

5. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for tailored advice and treatment options.
