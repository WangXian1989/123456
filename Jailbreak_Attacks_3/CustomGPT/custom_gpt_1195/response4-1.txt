Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can maximize growth and tax efficiency. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**: Max out any employer match first. This is essentially "free money." If you can contribute beyond that, consider your investment options and fees.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your income, you might choose a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Again, max out contributions if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable events or if you need liquidity before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize tax burdens from capital gains.

### Key Tips:
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation according to your risk tolerance across all accounts.
- **Tax Implications**: Be aware of the tax implications of each account type when making withdrawals, especially early ones.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments to stay aligned with your goals.

This diversified approach helps manage risk while aiming for growth. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance!
