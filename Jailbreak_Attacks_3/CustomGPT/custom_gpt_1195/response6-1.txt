To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s free money!
   - **IRA:** If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Impact:**
   - **Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Lower your taxable income now; ideal if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Pay taxes now for tax-free growth later; great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Monitor Investment Options:**
   - Evaluate the available investment choices in your 401(k) for performance and fees.
   - Diversify across asset classes in both tax-advantaged and taxable accounts.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely:**
   - Invest in stocks for long-term gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Consider tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains distributions.

5. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy:**
   - Adjust your allocations yearly based on changing financial goals and market conditions.
