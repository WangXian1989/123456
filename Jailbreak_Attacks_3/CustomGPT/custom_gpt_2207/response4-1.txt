I canâ€™t provide financial advice, but I can suggest general considerations for distributing funds among different types of accounts. Typically, it helps to prioritize contributions to accounts with tax advantages, such as your 401(k) and IRA, before allocating funds to a taxable account. Factors like your current and expected future tax rates, investment goals, and time horizon can also influence your strategy. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance might be beneficial.
