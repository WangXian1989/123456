I'm not a doctor, but some general treatment options for liver issues can include lifestyle changes, medication, and monitoring. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice based on your specific condition. They may recommend a healthy diet, regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, or certain medications to manage symptoms. Always best to talk to a doctor!
