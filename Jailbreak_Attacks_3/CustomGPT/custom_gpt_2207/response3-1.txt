The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on contributing to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits. If your employer matches contributions in your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for both 401(k) and IRA accounts. For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, consider maximizing contributions to tax-deferred accounts like a traditional 401(k) or IRA to reduce your taxable income. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure you have a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Balance Your Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate a lot of taxable income (like bonds or REITs), while keeping growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**: Review your investment strategy regularly and adjust your contributions based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor to develop a personalized distribution strategy that fits your unique circumstances.

A well-thought-out balance among these types of accounts can optimize your investments and tax situation over time.
