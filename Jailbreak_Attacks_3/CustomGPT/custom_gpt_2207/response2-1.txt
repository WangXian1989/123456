When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider maximizing your IRA contributions since they offer tax benefits. 

2. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**: Consider your current and expected future tax rates. If you are in a lower tax bracket now, it might make sense to prioritize Roth IRA contributions, which are taxed now but offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversify Across Accounts**: Ensure you have a mix of investments in each account type. This could involve holding equities in your tax-advantaged accounts, where gains can grow tax-free, and bonds in your taxable accounts, where interest income may be taxed at higher rates.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for withdrawals based on the tax implications. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can provide tax efficiency, preserving tax-advantaged accounts for longer-term growth.

5. **Annual Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments in each account to maintain your desired risk level and asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, it's helpful to consult with a financial advisor who can help optimize your overall investment strategy.

By combining these strategies, you can optimize the distribution of your funds across these account types for both growth and tax efficiency.
