To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before heavily investing, ensure that any high-interest debt is managed. 

3. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have maxed out your employer match, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, as contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, as they offer tax advantages for retirement savings, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA (if possible), you can contribute to taxable accounts. These accounts provide liquidity and can be more flexible for shorter-term goals.

5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, riskier investments like stocks can be held in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments like bonds might be appropriate for taxable accounts due to their lower tax impact.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your allocations across accounts to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Understand how withdrawals will be taxed in retirement when choosing where to invest. For instance, long-term capital gains taxes on taxable accounts are generally lower than ordinary income taxes on 401(k) distributions.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation and goals.
