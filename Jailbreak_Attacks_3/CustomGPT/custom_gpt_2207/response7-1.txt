Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Contribute to Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA since these accounts provide tax advantages. The annual contribution limits for 2023 are $20,500 for a 401(k) (plus a $6,500 catch-up if you're over 50) and $6,500 for an IRA (plus a $1,000 catch-up).

3. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth Accounts**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k). Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, traditional accounts may be more beneficial, as they allow for tax-deductible contributions.

4. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have short- to medium-term goals or need access to funds before retirement, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility without penalties for early withdrawal, although you will be subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Invest According to Risk Tolerance**: Ensure that your investment allocations in each account align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Younger investors typically can take on more risk compared to those nearing retirement.

6. **Rebalance Appropriately**: Regularly review and rebalance your investment portfolio across all accounts to ensure that your asset allocation remains aligned with your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can help you create a personalized plan based on your unique circumstances and goals.

Keep in mind that individual financial situations can vary greatly, so itâ€™s important to consider your specific needs and consult with a financial professional for personalized advice.
