To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your match, prioritize contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages that can enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that off before allocating excessive funds to retirement accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds or ETFs), which can be more tax-efficient.

5. **Diversification**: Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and return.

6. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

7. **Professional Advice**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific situation.

This balanced approach helps optimize growth while managing tax implications.
