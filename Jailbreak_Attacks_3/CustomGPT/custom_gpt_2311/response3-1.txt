Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a structured approach:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred growth; contributions may lower taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Tax advantages dependent on the type (tax-deferred for Traditional, tax-free growth for Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages but higher flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out employer match in your 401(k) first for “free” money.
   - Consider fully funding your IRA next (both Traditional and Roth have limits).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to maximize savings.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments expected to generate high capital gains or income.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline (e.g., stocks in growth accounts, bonds in conservative).

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and rebalance your portfolio annually to maintain desired asset allocation.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy considering tax implications, usually withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-advantaged accounts.

**Example Distribution Strategy**:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full company match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions after your 401(k) match.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds for investment, focusing on tax-efficient funds or strategies.
