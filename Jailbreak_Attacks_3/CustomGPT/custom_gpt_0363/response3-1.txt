Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially "free money".
   - **IRA**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation).

2. **Consider the Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold. They may be suitable for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure that each type of account holds a diversified mix of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and goals.

4. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a separate account, ensuring you have liquidity to cover unexpected expenses without dipping into your retirement accounts.

5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

**Conclusion**: Start with employer matching contributions in your 401(k), follow with IRA contributions, and use taxable accounts for additional savings, focusing on strategies to minimize taxes. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
