To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions or if you donâ€™t have access to a 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Balance Contributions**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider splitting additional savings between your 401(k) and IRA, based on which offers better investment choices and lower fees.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you'll need in the short term or for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.
   - Focus on holding tax-efficient investments (like ETFs or index funds) in taxable accounts to reduce capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline, regardless of account type. Consider having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your strategy to ensure it aligns with changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions.

By taking a holistic approach and using the strengths of each account type, you can optimize your investment strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
