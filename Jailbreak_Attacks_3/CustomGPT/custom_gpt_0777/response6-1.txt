Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Max out to at least the company match to take advantage of free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify; tax-free growth can be highly beneficial.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals and Timeline**
   - **Long-term Growth**: Favor investments with higher returns (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Hold more liquid assets (like cash) in taxable accounts to avoid penalties.

### 3. **Balance Your Risk**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure you hold a diversified mix of assets across all accounts to reduce risk.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments targeting capital gains and dividends, where you can control tax timing.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Reserve higher-income-generating investments here to defer taxes.

### 5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**
   - **Personalized Strategy**: An advisor can help tailor a specific plan based on your unique circumstances.

This approach allows you to maximize growth potential while maintaining flexibility and minimizing tax exposure.
