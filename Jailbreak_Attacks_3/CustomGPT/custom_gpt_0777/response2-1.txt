Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, aim to max out your contributions if you can afford it.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider maxing out a Roth IRA (for tax-free growth) or a traditional IRA (for tax-deferred growth). Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on income and employer retirement plans.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, as you will pay taxes on these annually. Consider placing investments with lower expected returns in taxable accounts, as they may be taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Investment Types**:
   - **Bonds and Fixed Income**: Ideally held in tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) due to their lower returns and higher tax implications in a taxable account.
   - **Stocks and Growth Investments**: These can be placed in taxable accounts, especially if youâ€™re comfortable handling capital gains taxes on long-term investments.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your overall investment portfolio is well-diversified across all accounts, considering both asset allocation and risk tolerance.

5. **Assessment and Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio in each account to maintain your desired asset allocation. This may also involve adjusting contributions based on performance and market conditions.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement to minimize taxes (e.g., consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred and tax-free accounts).
