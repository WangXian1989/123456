Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices**: Consider the investment options available in your plan and their fees.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing there for tax-free growth. Traditional IRAs offer a tax deduction now, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals later.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits and whether you're eligible to deduct traditional IRA contributions based on income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for investments that you might need to access earlier without penalties. They're also suitable for investments that generate capital gains, as long-term capital gains are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider placing tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains.

### Suggested Strategy
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the match.
- **Funding IRAs**: If you have additional funds, prioritize maxing out your IRA contributions.
- **Allocate Remaining Funds**: Use any surplus for your taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Considerations
- **Time Horizon**: Longer time horizons can take on more risk in retirement accounts.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Impact your investment choices based on how much risk you’re comfortable with.
- **Tax Situation**: Work with a financial advisor or tax professional to tailor your strategy to your unique financial circumstances. 

This balanced approach can help maximize growth while considering taxes and your future needs.
