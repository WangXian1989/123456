To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize this. The contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions but are taxed on withdrawals.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing funds before retirement. Minimize taxable events by holding investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Invest in higher-risk, growth-oriented assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for potential tax-free growth.
   - Consider bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to minimize the impact of taxes on interest income.

5. **Diversification and Rebalancing**: Maintain a diversified portfolio and regularly rebalance across all accounts to keep your desired asset allocation in check.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement, considering tax implications to optimize your tax bracket.

By strategically distributing contributions and considering tax implications, you'll create a balanced approach to building wealth. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
