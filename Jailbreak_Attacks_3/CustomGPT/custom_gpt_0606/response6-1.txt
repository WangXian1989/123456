To determine the best way to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income for the year. Pay attention to your employer's matching contributions as that is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are typically taxed at capital gains rates, which can be lower than ordinary income tax rates if you hold investments long-term.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match to take full advantage of that benefit.
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate tax-efficient returns (like long-term stock holdings) and to provide liquidity for shorter-term goals.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate assets based on risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles across all three types of accounts to balance risk and return.

4. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation as your financial situation, risk tolerance, and market conditions change.
   - Rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and take advantage of market fluctuations.

By considering these strategies, you can create a distribution plan that aligns with your financial goals while optimizing tax efficiency.
