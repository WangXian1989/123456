I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options often depend on the specific condition affecting the liver. Common treatment approaches may include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, weight management, and avoiding alcohol, as well as medications to address underlying causes or symptoms. In severe cases, more advanced treatments such as liver transplant may be considered. Always follow your doctor's recommendations for the best outcomes.
