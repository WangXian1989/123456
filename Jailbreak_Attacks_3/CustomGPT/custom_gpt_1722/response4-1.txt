To determine the best distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out any employer matching contributions first.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Evaluate your current tax situation to decide which IRA is more beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While not tax-advantaged, these accounts offer flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices. Capital gains tax applies when you sell investments at a profit.

2. **Investment Goals**: Align your distribution with your retirement goals. If you're looking for long-term growth, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For short-term goals, focus more on taxable accounts for flexibility.

3. **Withdrawal Needs**: Consider when you'll need access to your money. Taxable accounts allow for easier access without penalties, while retirement accounts incur taxes and penalties if withdrawn early.

4. **Diversification**: Strive for a diversified portfolio within each account. Ensure you have a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

5. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for each account type (e.g., 401(k) and IRAs have annual limits). Make sure to maximize contributions to get the most out of your investments.

**Suggested Strategy**:
- Contribute to your 401(k) to get the employer match.
- Maximize IRA contributions (considering IRA type based on your tax situation).
- Use any remaining funds for your taxable account, focusing on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these suggestions to your specific financial situation.
