To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically, contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on the contributions or gains until you withdraw in retirement. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), IRAs can be tax-deferred (Traditional IRA) or tax-free (Roth IRA). Depending on your current tax situation and retirement expectations, choose accordingly.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for assets that may generate taxable income (like stocks and bonds) where you may want the flexibility of withdrawing funds without penalties.

3. **Consider Investment Options**: Different accounts may offer different investment options. Choose investments that align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth investments (like stocks) that can benefit from compounding over time.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate regular income (like bonds) and to maintain liquidity.

4. **Diversify**: Within each account type, diversify your investments. This could involve holding a mix of equities, fixed income, and alternative assets based on your risk profile.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Make consistent contributions to each account instead of trying to fully fund one before moving to the next. This strategy also allows you to benefit from dollar-cost averaging.

6. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to ensure that your asset allocation stays aligned with your investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice that considers your financial situation, tax implications, and retirement goals, consulting with a financial advisor is always a wise choice.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment approach across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
