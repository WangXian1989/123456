To optimize the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial goals, tax implications, and investment preferences:

1. **Understand Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Ideal for higher income brackets.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but they offer flexibility in accessing funds and different tax treatment for capital gains.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Balance Between Accounts**: After securing the match, consider your tax situation to decide between maxing out your IRA or further contributing to your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for short-term needs or to maintain liquidity, especially if you anticipate needing access before retirement.

3. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance Consideration**: Depending on your risk profile, allocate equities within your taxable account for potentially lower long-term capital gains tax and keep fixed income in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your investment allocations to align with market performance and your evolving financial goals.

Make sure to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your particular situation and goals.
