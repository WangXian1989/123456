   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or reduce inflammation.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups to monitor liver function.

4. **Avoid Alcohol**: 
   - Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver health.

5. **Hydration**: 
   - Staying well-hydrated supports liver function.

6. **Treatment for Underlying Conditions**: 
   - Managing conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol can help.

7. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare provider for the most suitable options based on your condition.
