Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the limit, particularly if you have a match. Consider whether it’s a traditional or Roth 401(k).
   - **IRA**: Next, maximize contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA, which can provide tax advantages based on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider your taxable accounts. These can be more flexible and allow for easier access to funds if needed.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of capital gains and withdrawals. Taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes, while IRAs and 401(k)s have different tax treatments on withdrawals.

5. **Balance**: Regularly review your allocations based on market performance and your changing financial situation to ensure you're on track with your retirement goals.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice is also a good idea.
