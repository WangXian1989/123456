Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k)):**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is basically free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your tax situation, max out contributions to an IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. These can provide flexibility for withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and adjust based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact. Consider placing bonds and other interest-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes on interest income.

6. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
