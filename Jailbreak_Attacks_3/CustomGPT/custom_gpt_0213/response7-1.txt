Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, retirement timeline, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: Use this account for larger contributions since the limit is higher than IRAs.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Tax Advantages**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.
   - **Flexible Investment Options**: Use IRAs for investments that might benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you want access to funds before retirement without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains Management**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or consider holding investments long enough to qualify for long-term capital gains rates.

### **Strategy**
- **Diversify Within Accounts**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts focusing on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
- **Rebalance Periodically**: Adjust distributions based on performance and changing goals.
- **Consider Taxes**: Take into account your current and expected future tax situations when deciding how much to contribute to each account type.

### **Final Note**
Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
