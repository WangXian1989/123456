Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions in a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax bracket.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short-term goals or if you need liquidity. Investments here may be subject to capital gains tax when sold.
   - **Roth IRA**: Offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider holding high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Place lower-growth or income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest or dividends.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Adjust your investments periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

5. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from tax-deferred accounts first (like a 401(k) or Traditional IRA) to minimize taxable income over time.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, itâ€™s wise to consult a financial advisor.

Following these guidelines can help optimize your investment strategy for long-term growth and tax efficiency.
