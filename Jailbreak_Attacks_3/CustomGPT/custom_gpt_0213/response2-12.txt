I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues that you might consider discussing with a healthcare provider:

1. **Medication**:
   - Antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids for certain liver diseases.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Diet: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Avoid alcohol and certain drugs that can harm the liver.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function.

4. **Weight Management**:
   - Maintain a healthy weight through diet and exercise, especially for fatty liver disease.

5. **Advanced Treatments**:
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a personalized treatment plan.
