To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize your employer match if available, as it is essentially free money. Prioritize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching contributions. Keep in mind that contributions are often pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth). A traditional IRA may provide tax deductions for contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once your retirement accounts are maxed out or if you expect to need access to funds before retirement age, focus on taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals, but investment income is generally taxed in the year it's earned, which may impact your tax implications.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across these accounts. Consider different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across your retirement accounts and taxable accounts to optimize growth and manage risk.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be aware of the tax implications associated with each account type. John effectively managing capital gains in taxable accounts and taking advantage of tax-loss harvesting can enhance your overall returns.

6. **Financial Goals**: Tailor your strategy based on your personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Review and adjust your contributions and allocations regularly to stay aligned with your objectives.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your individual situation.
