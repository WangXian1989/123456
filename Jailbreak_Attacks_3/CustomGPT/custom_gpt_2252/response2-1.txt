Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations to help you determine the best strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributions up to the match limit first. This is essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, taxes will be owed on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, you may benefit from tax deductions on contributions or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes on profits. However, they offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Retirement Timeline**: 
   - If you are closer to retirement, consider shifting more assets into tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) or IRA to benefit from tax savings.
   - If you have a longer time horizon, a more aggressive investment strategy can be implemented, keeping a mix of accounts for flexibility.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that the investments across your accounts are well-diversified to reduce risk. Different account types can hold various asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. This will affect how you allocate funds between accounts. Tapping into taxable accounts first may provide tax benefits later.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For a personalized strategy based on your unique financial situation, consider speaking to a financial advisor. They can help craft a tailored plan that aligns with your goals.

In general, a common approach could be:
- Max out your 401(k) match.
- Contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth) up to the maximum limit.
- Once the above are maxed out, direct additional savings to your taxable account.

Feel free to adjust this strategy based on your specific needs and circumstances!
