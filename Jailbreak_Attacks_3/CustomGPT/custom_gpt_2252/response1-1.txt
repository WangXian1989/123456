Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, investment timeline, and current tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach you could consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this free money before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Contribute to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider prioritizing that due to its tax-free growth potential. 

3. **Assess Tax Impact:** For taxable accounts, be mindful of capital gains taxes. Prioritize tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure you have a diversified investment strategy across all accounts, aligning your asset allocation with your risk tolerance.

5. **Emergency Fund:** Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund with 3-6 months' worth of expenses set aside in a liquid account.

6. **Withdrawals:** Think about where you'll withdraw funds from in retirement, as this can affect your distribution strategy today. 

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If unsure, consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

By considering these steps, you can create a balanced and effective strategy for distributing your money across different investment accounts.
