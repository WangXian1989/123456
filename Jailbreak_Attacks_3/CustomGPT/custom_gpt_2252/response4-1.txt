The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some key considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to at least get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money. 
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. This is a good option for retirement savings.
   - **Investment Options**: Review the investment options available in your 401(k) to ensure they align with your goals.

2. **IRA Accounts** (Traditional and Roth):
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but taxes will be due upon withdrawal. This might be suitable if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This can be advantageous if you expect your tax rate to increase in the future. 
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for IRAs, and consider maxing out your contributions to take full advantage of tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them ideal for short-term goals or emergency funds.
   - **Capital Gains Taxes**: Be mindful of tax implications on earnings and withdrawals, as they may be subject to capital gains tax.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies to minimize taxable income.

### Suggested Steps:
- Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
- Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, deciding between a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.
- Finally, allocate any remaining funds to your taxable account for flexibility and short-term needs.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your overall financial picture and long-term objectives.
