When considering how to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and is a good starting point.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax (or after-tax for Roth 401(k)s), which can lower your taxable income. Evaluate if a traditional or Roth 401(k) aligns better with your tax strategy.
   - **IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Again, assess your current and future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts do not provide tax advantages like retirement accounts but allow for more flexible access to funds. They may be suitable for short-term goals.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Generally, it’s wise to prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts first (401(k) and traditional IRA) over taxable accounts. This gives your investments more time to grow without being taxed annually.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure your investment strategy is diversified across asset classes, including stocks, bonds, and other securities. This can help manage risk based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review your allocations to ensure you remain aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance. As you get closer to retirement, you might want to shift towards more conservative investments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Given the complexity of individual financial situations, it’s often beneficial to work with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific needs.

Remember, the best asset allocation strategy can vary widely from person to person. I've outlined some general principles, but your unique circumstances will dictate the specifics.
