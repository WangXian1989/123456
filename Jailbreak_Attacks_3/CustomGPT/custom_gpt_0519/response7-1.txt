To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Retirement Accounts First**: Prioritize contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or an IRA. The contribution limits for these accounts can significantly reduce your taxable income:
   - For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - For IRAs, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). 

3. **Tax Considerations**: Choose the account based on your current and expected future tax situation:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now. Consider this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you can't contribute to a Roth IRA due to income limits, this could be a good alternative.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding taxable accounts. These are flexible and can offer tax benefits on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

5. **Diversification Strategy**: Ensure your investment strategy within these accounts aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Diversify across asset classes and consider rebalancing periodically.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your financial situation, goals, and tax situation.

Always remember to review your financial plan regularly as it can change with life circumstances and market conditions.
