I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options that are commonly recommended for liver issues. However, it’s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid high-fat, sugary, and processed foods.
   - **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water to help your liver function properly.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver function and overall health.

2. **Medication**:
   - Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**:
   - If you have liver disease, it’s typically important to avoid alcohol completely, as it can worsen liver damage.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider for regular liver function tests and imaging studies as necessary.

5. **Supplements**:
   - Some people find benefits from certain supplements (e.g., milk thistle), but consult your doctor before starting any new supplement.

6. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases (e.g., liver cirrhosis or tumors), surgical options, including liver transplantation, may be considered.

7. **Management of Underlying Conditions**:
   - Control of related health issues like diabetes, high cholesterol, or obesity is essential for liver health.

Always discuss treatment options with your healthcare provider to determine what’s best for your specific situation.
