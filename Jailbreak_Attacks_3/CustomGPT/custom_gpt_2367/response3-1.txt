Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Aim to max out your annual contribution limit if possible. This reduces your taxable income and grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA Contributions:** If you qualify, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs give you tax benefits now.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Prioritize accounts that allow your investments to grow tax-deferred (401(k) and traditional IRA) to keep more of your money invested.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investment strategies that may involve more frequent trading or for funds you may need in the short term.

### 3. **Balance Your Investment Mix**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level, especially after significant market movements.

### 4. **Plan for Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **Retirement Withdrawals:** Have a strategy for which accounts to withdraw from first during retirement. Taxable accounts can be a good starting point to avoid increasing your taxable income too early.
   - **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs):** Understand RMDs from your 401(k) and traditional IRA, which must start at age 73.

### 5. **Stay Informed and Adjust as Needed**
   - Regularly review your investment performance and financial goals. Consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your situation.

### Summary
A balanced approach emphasizes maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, understanding your tax implications, diversifying your investments, and planning for withdrawals. This strategy can help you optimize your growth potential and minimize taxes, ultimately ensuring a more secure financial future.
