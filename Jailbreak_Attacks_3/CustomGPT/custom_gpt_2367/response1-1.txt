Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match; this is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits. Roth IRAs are particularly valuable since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These can be useful for short-term goals or if you're close to retirement. Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding low-turnover index funds or ETFs to minimize taxable events.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Allocate your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. For example:
     - **Equities** in your 401(k) or IRA for growth.
     - **Bonds** for stability, possibly in your taxable account to manage tax impacts.

### 4. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Assess your allocations at least annually to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Before maximizing investments, ensure you have an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your income (especially if there’s an employer match).
- **IRA:** Max out contributions ($6,500 for 2024, $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Account:** Use remaining funds after maxing out tax-advantaged options.

### Pro Tips
- Stay informed about contribution limits and tax laws.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

This way, you can effectively balance growth, tax efficiency, and liquidity!
