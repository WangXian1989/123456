I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Medications**: Drugs can help manage liver diseases. This can include antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, limiting alcohol intake, and avoiding drugs that can be harmful to the liver are crucial.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and liver function tests can help track the disease's progression and adjust treatments as necessary.

4. **Supplements and Vitamins**: In some cases, doctors may recommend certain supplements, such as vitamin E for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options like liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific situation.
