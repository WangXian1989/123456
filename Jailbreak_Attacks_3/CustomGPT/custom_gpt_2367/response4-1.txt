Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k).** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth).** After maxing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth on qualified withdrawals.

### 3. **Tax Diversification**
   - **Taxable Accounts.** Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens, such as index funds or ETFs. Theyâ€™re also good for short-term goals or emergency funds.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA.** Consider holding a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance. Generally, place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement, focusing on strategies to minimize taxes. For example, withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

### 6. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**
   - Life changes and market shifts can affect your allocation. Review your portfolio at least annually and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your goals.

### General Distribution Example:
- **Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match.**
- **Max out your IRA contributions next.**
- **Invest in taxable accounts if you have additional funds, focusing on long-term growth.**

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
