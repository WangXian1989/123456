To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA Contributions:** After maximizing the match, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions.
   - Consider income limits for Roth IRAs and potential tax implications for Traditional IRAs when withdrawing.

### 3. **Balance Taxable Accounts**
   - Once maxed out on your 401(k) and IRA, contribute to a taxable account. This can provide flexibility and access without penalties.

### 4. **Investment Diversification**
   - Diversify investments across all accounts, balancing stock and bond allocations based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - Favor tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawals and Tax Implications**
   - Strategize on how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement. Plan the order of withdrawals to minimize taxes, e.g., using taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

### 6. **Revisit Regularly**
   - Review your allocation annually or after major life changes to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.
