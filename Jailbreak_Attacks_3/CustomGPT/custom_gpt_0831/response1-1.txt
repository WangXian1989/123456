Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few factors, such as your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Max out employer match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s free money!

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs are tax-free on qualified withdrawals, which can be beneficial in retirement.

3. **Contribute to your 401(k)**: After maximizing the IRA contribution, continue putting money into your 401(k) up to the maximum limit.

4. **Taxable accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts, you can invest in a taxable account. This could also involve investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs.

5. **Diversification**: Make sure your investment mix aligns with your risk tolerance and goals. This might involve balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets across these accounts.

6. **Tax implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts, as this could impact your tax liability compared to tax-advantaged accounts.

Ultimately, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation and goals.
