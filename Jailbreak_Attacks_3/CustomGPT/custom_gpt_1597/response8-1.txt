Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends heavily on your individual financial situation, including your current income, tax bracket, and retirement goals. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize any employer matching contributions, then consider contributing the maximum allowed if it's your best option for tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you're looking for a tax deduction now, a Traditional IRA might be a good option, but be aware of income limits based on your tax filing status.

3. **Consider Roth Conversions**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, it might make sense to invest more in Roth accounts (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) since you pay taxes now, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions and have additional funds, investing in taxable accounts can be beneficial. These funds are more flexible since they aren’t subject to the same withdrawal penalties as retirement accounts, and you can access them without age restrictions.

5. **Asset Allocation and Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure that your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation may change, so it’s essential to reassess your contributions and allocations regularly.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

It's important to frequently review your financial plan to ensure it aligns with your evolving goals and that you're optimizing your tax strategy.
