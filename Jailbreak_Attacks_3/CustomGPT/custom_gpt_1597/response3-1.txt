The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before directing money to other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs are similar to 401(k)s regarding taxes (tax-deductible now, taxed later). Roth IRAs, however, are funded with after-tax money, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment income (like dividends and capital gains) in taxable accounts is subject to taxation in the year it is realized. However, they offer more flexibility in terms of access to funds without penalties.

3. **Establish an Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have savings in a low-risk, accessible account for emergencies before fully investing.

4. **Diversify Investments:** Ensure you have a balanced portfolio that reflects your risk tolerance and investment timeline. This might include stocks, bonds, and other assets across all account types.

5. **Revisit Annually:** Periodically review and adjust your contributions and investment allocations based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Planner:** For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

In summary, start by maximizing your 401(k) contributions for any employer match and then consider tax implications when distributing additional funds among IRA and taxable accounts. Always keep a diversified investment strategy and review it regularly.
