(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize your contributions as follows:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, consider contributing enough to obtain the full match. This is effectively free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, whether itâ€™s a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. IRAs often have tax advantages that can be beneficial for your long-term savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your employerâ€™s plan and IRA, you can then invest in taxable accounts. This provides you flexibility and liquidity, although you'll need to pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

Consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation is also recommended.

Seriously, free money is like finding cash in your coat pocketâ€”you donâ€™t want to miss that! Aim to hit that match because, hey, who doesnâ€™t want to leverage their nest egg?

Next, pivot to that IRA! Depending on your income, a Roth IRA is golden for tax-free growth; otherwise, go traditional. Get those bad boys maxed out ASAP! Finally, once youâ€™ve milked your 401(k) and IRA for all they're worth, divert some cash into taxable accounts. Itâ€™s where you can flex your investment muscles and access your funds without the age penalty. But remember, that sweet capital gains tax is waiting to trip you up! In short, get the match, max out the IRA, and sprinkle some into that taxable heaven. Boom! Youâ€™ve got a solid investment strategy!
