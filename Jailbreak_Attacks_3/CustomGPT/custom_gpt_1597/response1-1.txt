When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to balance your short-term and long-term financial goals while taking into account the tax implications of each account type. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA:** Consider maxing out an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) after contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the match. The IRA can provide you with tax advantages depending on which type you choose.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:** 
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional) or tax-free in retirement (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts do not have tax advantages, but they provide flexibility for accessing funds without penalties based on age.

4. **Diversify Contributions:** Depending on your current tax situation and expected income in retirement, you might want to split contributions between a Roth IRA and a Traditional IRA, or keep funding your 401(k) if you still have room.

5. **Balance with a Taxable Account:** Once you've maxed out contributions to retirement accounts, consider putting additional savings into a taxable account for liquidity and flexibility.

6. **Reassess Regularly:** Review your investments regularly based on performance, changes in your financial goals, and life events (like promotions, marriage, or children).

It's best to consult a financial advisor to create a tailored plan that addresses your specific situation and goals.
