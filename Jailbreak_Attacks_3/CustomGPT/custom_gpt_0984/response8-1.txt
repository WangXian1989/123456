To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Identify your retirement goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. This will influence your asset allocation.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the maximum match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this first, especially if there’s a match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) contribution (up to the annual limit), consider contributing to an IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductibility depending on your income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that may generate taxable income, like bonds or dividend-paying stocks.
   - Consider tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure, a financial professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.

By following these steps, you can optimize your investment strategy for both growth and tax efficiency.
