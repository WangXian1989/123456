To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match firstâ€”it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Focus on this up to the match, then consider other options.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Good for tax deduction if you're eligible. Consider this if you're looking to reduce current taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Great for long-term growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
  
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for excess funds after maximizing retirement accounts. This allows for more flexibility with withdrawals and can be useful for short-term savings.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher bracket now, lean towards traditional accounts. If you're expecting to be in a lower bracket during retirement, Roth accounts might be better.

5. **Investment Strategy Diversity**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Keep in mind that certain investments may be more tax-efficient in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds).

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your portfolio and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and your financial goals.
