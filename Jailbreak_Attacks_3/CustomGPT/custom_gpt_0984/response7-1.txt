To optimize your investment strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, which is essentially free money.
   - If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you expect your tax rate to rise in the future.

2. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on gains.
   - Allocate more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications on interest income.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - In taxable accounts, prioritize tax-efficient investments such as index funds and ETFs, which typically generate fewer taxable events.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when making trades in taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan for withdrawals by considering the tax implications of each account type. Generally, tax-advantaged accounts are taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth IRAs can provide tax-free income in retirement.

5. **Review and Rebalance**: 
   - Regularly assess your portfolio's performance and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance.
