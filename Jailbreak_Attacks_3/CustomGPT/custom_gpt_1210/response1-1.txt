Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - Consider the tax benefits of pre-tax contributions versus Roth contributions.

2. **Fund an IRA**: 
   - If eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - Consider a traditional IRA for its tax-deferred growth potential, especially if you’re currently in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio among these accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment time horizon.
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on tax implications; for instance, place bonds in tax-deferred accounts to avoid interest income tax.

5. **Review Regularly**: 
   - Reassess your allocation periodically, especially as your financial situation or goals change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
