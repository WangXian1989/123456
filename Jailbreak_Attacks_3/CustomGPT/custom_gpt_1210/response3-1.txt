Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Benefits**
   - **401(k):** Often comes with employer matching contributions, which is essentially free money. Contributions are tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No contribution limits or withdrawal penalties, but dividends and capital gains are taxed.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first.
   - **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.
   - **Back to 401(k):** After maxing out the IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) to maximize contributions.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions lower your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Ideal if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Useful for investing in high-growth assets or if you want flexibility in withdrawals.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider placing higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically check your allocations and adjust based on performance and life changes.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** 15% of income (max out employer match)
- **IRA:** $6,500/year (or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Account:** 10% of income after maximizing above contributions

This can vary greatly depending on personal circumstances, so consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
