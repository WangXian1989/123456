I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with your healthcare provider:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can greatly benefit liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may help manage symptoms or treat the underlying issue.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies can help monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Supplements**: Some people find liver-supportive supplements, like milk thistle, helpful, but consult your doctor before trying these.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplants may be necessary.

Make sure to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options tailored to your condition.
