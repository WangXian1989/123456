Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA can provide tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that off before investing.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may want to access before retirement age. This provides more liquidity and flexibility compared to retirement accounts.

5. **Balanced Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively. For example, stocks can be held in tax-deferred accounts, while bonds or less tax-efficient investments can be held in taxable accounts.

6. **Ongoing Adjustments**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions, personal financial situations, and retirement goals.

It may also be wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations tailored to your specific circumstances.
