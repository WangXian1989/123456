Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions depending on your income.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your employer match and contributing to your IRA, continue maxing out your 401(k). This provides tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings, especially for short-term goals. Consider investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds) to minimize taxes.

5. **Diversified Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. Balance asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Withdrawal Considerations**: Plan ahead for when you’ll need to access these funds. Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRA before age 59½ usually incur penalties.

Consult with a financial advisor for a personalized plan that considers your specific situation and goals.
