Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines for each type of account:

1. **401(k) Account**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Look at the available investment options (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) and choose those that align with your risk tolerance and time frame.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Implications**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes due on withdrawal) and a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals). A Roth might be better if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket when you retire.
   - **Diversification**: Use your IRA to invest in a mix of assets that may be less accessible in your 401(k), like individual stocks or bonds, depending on your investment strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility and Access**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may want to access before retirement or for more liquid assets.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger individuals might lean more heavily into stocks, whereas those closer to retirement may prefer bonds.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your distribution and investment performance regularly to adjust according to changes in goals or market conditions.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific circumstances.
