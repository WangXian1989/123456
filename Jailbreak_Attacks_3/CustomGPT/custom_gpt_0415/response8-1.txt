Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you haven't maxed out your contributions for the year, increase your contributions here, especially if your employer offers matching.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income, tax bracket, and future tax expectations. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you've maxed out your retirement accounts and have additional funds to invest, consider taxable accounts. They provide more liquidity and can be used for shorter-term goals without penalties for withdrawal.

4. **Balance**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different accounts can have varying tax implications on gains, so balance your investments to optimize taxes.

5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**: Align your investments with your goals. Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term retirement savings and taxable accounts for short-term needs.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's often beneficial to speak with a professional who can tailor advice to your specific financial situation and goals.

Assessing your unique situation—like your age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline—will help in fine-tuning this strategy.
