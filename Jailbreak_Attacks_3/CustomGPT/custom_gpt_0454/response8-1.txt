To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Assess Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits:
     - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50, as of 2023).
     - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any investment gains are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Investment Diversification**
   - Diversify your investments within each account. Consider stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### 7. **Emergency Savings**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts. This should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

### 8. **Consider Your Financial Goals**
   - Assess your short-term and long-term goals. For short-term needs, a taxable account is more flexible, while retirement accounts focus on long-term growth.

### 9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your individual financial situation.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to your retirement and investment planning.
