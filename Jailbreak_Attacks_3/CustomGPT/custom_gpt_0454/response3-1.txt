Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA** contributions are tax-deferred, which can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions are made with after-tax dollars but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Investment Horizon**:
   - For longer-term goals, lean more towards equities in your tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate more taxable income (like bonds) or for shorter-term goals since youâ€™ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Diversify holdings to mitigate risk, taking advantage of both the tax benefits of tax-advantaged accounts and the flexibility of taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. This could mean shifting funds between your accounts based on performance and market conditions.

6. **Monitor Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each type of account to maximize your tax benefits.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, consider speaking with a financial planner or advisor.

Adjust your strategy as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.
