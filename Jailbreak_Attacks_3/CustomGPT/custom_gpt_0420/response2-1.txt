When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: After your 401(k), consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid, accessible taxable account before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Place lower-risk investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to leverage favorable tax treatment on long-term capital gains.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Be aware of the taxes on capital gains and dividends in taxable accounts. Prioritize tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in these accounts.

5. **Balance and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and life changes.

6. **Long-Term Perspective**:
   - Focus on your long-term goals rather than short-term market fluctuations. This strategy often yields better returns over time.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation.
