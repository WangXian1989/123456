ðŸ’° Are you maximizing your investments? 

Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown of how to distribute your money effectively:

1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, itâ€™s essentially free money! Aim for at least 15% of your salary if your budget allows.

2. **IRA:** Consider opening a Roth IRA if you qualify. Contributions grow tax-free, making it a great long-term option. If youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket now, traditional IRAs could be the way to go.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once youâ€™ve maximized your retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This provides flexibility for short-term goals without penalties for early withdrawals.

Remember, diversity is key! Each account type has its own benefits. Review and adjust your allocation yearly to stay on track toward your financial goals!
