When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to keep various factors in mind, including your financial goals, your current tax situation, and your investment objectives. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. As of 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (with an additional catch-up contribution for those over 50).

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are generally tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes until you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits as a 401(k) in terms of tax deferral.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income (interest, dividends, capital gains) is taxable in the year it is realized, so consider keeping less tax-efficient investments here.

4. **Investing Needs and Goals**: 
   - For retirement-focused accounts like a 401(k) or IRA, consider a long-term growth strategy with a mix of stocks and bonds that align with your risk tolerance.
   - For taxable accounts, you might want to consider more liquid investments or tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Allocate investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to spread out risk.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Periodically evaluate your investment performance and asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies that consider your entire financial picture.

Ultimately, a balanced approach depending on individual circumstances and goals is key to effective money distribution.
