It's great that you're thinking about how to distribute your money among different types of accounts! Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions for tax advantages, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, you might want to contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. Make sure to consider contribution limits and eligibility based on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After utilizing your 401(k) and IRA options, you can invest in taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes. This can be a good place for investments with lower turnover or investments aimed at long-term growth.

It's crucial to adjust your allocations based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation! 

Remember, the best strategy is one that aligns with your overall financial goals.
