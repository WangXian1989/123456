Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires considering several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Offered by employers, often includes company matching; contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax); good for individual retirement savings.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments outside tax-advantaged accounts; dividends and capital gains are taxed in the year they are earned.

2. **Set Your Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Are you saving for retirement, a home, or another major expense?

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first, as they offer tax benefits. The traditional accounts offer tax deferral, while Roth accounts provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for 401(k)s ($20,500 for 2023, $27,000 if over 50) and IRAs ($6,500, $7,500 if over 50). 

5. **Prioritize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match before directing money to an IRA or taxable account.

6. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within your accounts, create a balanced portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance. Diversification helps manage risk.

7. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Review and rebalance your distribution periodically, especially after major life events or changes in your financial goals.

8. **Consider Professional Advice**:
   - Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique circumstances.

By following these steps, you can create a well-structured approach to distributing your finances across different types of accounts to meet your objectives effectively.
