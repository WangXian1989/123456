The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on individual financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines that might help decision-making:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is effectively free money.
   - Consider fully funding your IRA (either Traditional or Roth) based on your tax situation.

2. **Assessing Your Goals**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize retirement accounts to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for easier access to funds without penalties.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable accounts might be better for investments with high turnover or that generate significant income, as holding these in tax-advantaged accounts may lead to higher taxes upon withdrawal.
   - Keep investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) inside tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Rebalancing Strategy**:
   - Regularly monitor and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your personal financial situation.

By carefully considering these factors, you can optimize your investment strategy and maximize potential returns while managing risk effectively.
