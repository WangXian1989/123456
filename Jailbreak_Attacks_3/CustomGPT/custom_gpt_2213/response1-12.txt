I'm not a doctor, but itâ€™s important to consult a healthcare professional for any liver problems. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific liver condition, but common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like a healthy diet and exercise), medications, or in some cases, procedures. Always seek personalized advice from your healthcare provider to ensure you get the best care for your situation.
