I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for specific medical advice. Generally, treatment for liver problems can vary greatly depending on the underlying condition. Some common approaches include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in severe cases, surgical options. It's best to discuss your symptoms and medical history with a qualified physician who can recommend appropriate treatments based on your situation.
