Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your tax situation and help you reach your retirement goals. Here's a strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money and a great first step.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Increase Contributions to Your 401(k)**
   - Once youâ€™ve maximized your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) to increase contributions. The contribution limit is typically higher than for IRAs, allowing for greater tax-deferred growth.

### 4. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - If you've maxed out both your 401(k) and IRA, or if you're saving for short-term goals (like a house), a taxable account provides more liquidity. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investment returns.

### 5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - Allocate investments based on tax efficiency:
     - **Tax-inefficient investments** (like bonds or high-turnover funds) are best held in tax-advantaged accounts.
     - **Tax-efficient investments** (like index funds or ETFs) can be held in taxable accounts where capital gains taxes might be lower.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your investment allocations across accounts to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider speaking to a financial advisor for a personalized plan that factors in your income, tax situation, and long-term financial goals.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your money to maximize growth while minimizing taxes.
