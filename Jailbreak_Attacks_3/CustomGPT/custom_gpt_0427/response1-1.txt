Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax considerations, and retirement goals. Here’s a simplified approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
  
3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing. Typically 3-6 months of expenses is a standard recommendation.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement or for funds that generate taxable income, like dividends.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, younger investors might opt for more aggressive investments (like stocks) while nearing retirement may prefer more conservative options (like bonds).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

### Technical Breakdown

- **401(k)**: Focus on tax-deferred growth. The maximum contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or over).
- **IRA**: The limit for traditional and Roth IRAs is $6,500 ($7,500 if 50+). 
- **Tax Implications**: Understand the capital gains tax for your taxable accounts and the benefits of holding investments long-term.
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

By combining these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that works towards your financial goals while maximizing tax efficiency.
