Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (if you're eligible). Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Contribute to Your 401(k)**: After funding your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This allows you to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This will give you flexibility, as you can access these funds without penalties before retirement age.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Typically, you'd want to have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets while considering the tax implications of capital gains in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your long-term financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax implications and personal financial situations, working with a financial advisor may help tailor an investment strategy that fits your needs.

Always keep in mind your current financial situation, retirement goals, and market conditions when making these decisions.
