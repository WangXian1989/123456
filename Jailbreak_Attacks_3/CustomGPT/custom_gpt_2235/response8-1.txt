It's generally advisable to consider a few key factors when distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can grow tax-deferred, and in the case of a Roth IRA, your withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.
   - Assess your current tax bracket and anticipate your future tax situation. Generally, investing in tax-advantaged accounts first is a smart move, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

2. **Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a match on contributions to your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Investment Options**:
   - Evaluate the investment options available in your 401(k) plan versus those in your IRA and taxable accounts. If your 401(k) has limited or high-fee options, you may want to prioritize your IRA or taxable account for more diversified or lower-cost investments.

5. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - If you anticipate needing access to your money before retirement age, consider keeping funds in taxable accounts, as these allow for more flexible withdrawals without penalties.

6. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Align your contributions with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. A well-diversified portfolio across these account types can help in managing risks while working toward investment growth.

Ultimately, it's often helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific financial situation and goals. They can provide personalized advice based on your overall financial picture.
