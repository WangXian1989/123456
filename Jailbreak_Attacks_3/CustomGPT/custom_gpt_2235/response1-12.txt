I'm not a doctor, but when dealing with liver problems, it's best to consult a healthcare professional who can evaluate your specific situation. Common approaches can include lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, surgery, depending on the severity and type of liver condition. A health professional will be able to provide personalized advice based on your needs. Please take care of yourself!
