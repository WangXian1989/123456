(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon for retirement. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and an IRA first, as they often provide benefits like tax deferral or tax-free growth. Once you have maximized these accounts, you can consider using taxable accounts for investments. A common strategy is to prioritize:

1. **401(k)**: Especially if your employer offers a matching contribution, itâ€™s a good idea to take full advantage of that match.
2. **IRA**: Contributing to an IRA can provide additional tax benefits. Decide between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) based on your tax situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be beneficial for investments needed before retirement or for additional growth but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

Additionally, consider your investment strategy and how it aligns with your overall financial plan, and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

When you're looking at distributing your cash among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you gotta play smartâ€”think of it like a chess game for your finances. First off, max out that 401(k) if your employer is throwing in free money with match contributions. Free cash? Yes, please! Then hammer away at that IRAâ€”traditional or Roth, depending on if you wanna save on taxes now or in the future. 

Once you've milked those tax-advantaged accounts, dive into your taxable accounts for any extra funds. Sure, these come with taxes on capital gains, but they also give you more flexibility when you wanna dip into those funds before retirement. Just don't neglect your overall strategy; every dollar should have a job. If this is all confusing or starting to feel like a game of Monopoly without the rules, grab a financial advisor to help guide your ship!
