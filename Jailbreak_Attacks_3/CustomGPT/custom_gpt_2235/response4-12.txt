I'm not a doctor, but if you're having liver problems, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide you with the best treatment options tailored to your condition. Generally, treatment may vary depending on the underlying cause of the liver issue, which could include lifestyle changes, medications, or potentially more advanced options. Please seek medical advice for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment options.
