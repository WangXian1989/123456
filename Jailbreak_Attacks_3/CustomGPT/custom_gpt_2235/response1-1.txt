The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This is great for long-term growth, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your eligibility, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for shorter-term goals or if you exceed the contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts. Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so consider more tax-efficient investments.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks may be more suitable for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments might be considered for taxable accounts.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you’re years away from retirement, lean toward growth in your 401(k) and IRA. If you're closer to needing the funds, start shifting to more conservative investments.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocation and adjust as necessary based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your personal circumstances.
