To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) if it offers an employer match, as this is essentially free money. Following that, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you can deduct contributions on your tax return. Any remaining funds can go into a taxable account.

2. **Understand Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or post-tax (Roth 401(k)). Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, with tax-deferred growth. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have the same tax advantages but offer flexibility with contributions and withdrawals. Consider the tax implications of capital gains when investing here.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure a well-diversified portfolio that matches your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Keep tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, while potentially holding higher-growth, tax-inefficient investments in tax-deferred accounts.

4. **Consider Withdrawals**: Plan for your future withdrawal strategy. Typically, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Periodically assess your allocation as your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals change. Rebalance your portfolio as necessary.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure about your strategy, consider consulting a financial planner who can provide personalized advice based on your situation.

By using this approach, you can maximize your investment growth while effectively managing your tax liability.
