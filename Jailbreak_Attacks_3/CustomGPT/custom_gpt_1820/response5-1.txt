(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is essentially free money and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **IRA**: Consider maximizing your IRA contributions next, as these accounts offer tax advantages. A Roth IRA allows tax-free growth, while a traditional IRA provides tax deductions on contributions, which can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After fully utilizing your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate additional funds to taxable investment accounts. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices, but you'll generally pay taxes on any realized capital gains and dividends.

Review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your overall investment strategy.
