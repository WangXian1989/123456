I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about potential treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common approaches depending on the type and severity of the liver issue:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - Avoiding alcohol and limiting consumption of saturated fats, sugars, and processed foods.
   - Maintaining a healthy weight through regular exercise.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis (like hepatitis B or C).
   - Medications to reduce inflammation or treat underlying conditions (such as corticosteroids for autoimmune hepatitis).
   - Supplements like milk thistle may be suggested, but always consult a doctor first.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging tests (like ultrasounds or MRIs) to assess liver structure.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: 
   - Limiting exposure to environmental toxins and certain medications that can harm the liver.

5. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - In severe cases, such as liver failure or cirrhosis, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always seek medical advice from a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
