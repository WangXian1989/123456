To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Often has higher contribution limits and may offer employer matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax, providing tax benefits now but taxes will be paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Can be traditional or Roth. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth but taxes are paid upon withdrawal. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are not tax-advantaged and can generate capital gains taxes on earnings. However, they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Determine Your Goals:**
   - Decide what your short- and long-term financial goals are. If you're saving primarily for retirement, prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts is usually wise.
   - Consider your time horizon. If you need access to funds in the near term, taxable accounts may be more appropriate.

3. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - Max out your IRA contributions if you can, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, due to its tax-free growth.

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Review the investment options within your 401(k) and IRA. Make sure to diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and age.
   - Consider placing more aggressive investments (higher risk, higher potential return) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) where you'll defer taxes on the growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate income or that you might need to access soon, as they can be taxed more favorably (preferential treatment for long-term capital gains).

5. **Rebalance As Necessary:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Professional:**
   - Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation.

By carefully strategizing how you allocate your funds across these accounts, you can enhance your savings and potentially reduce your tax burden over time.
