Determining the best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA (Individual Retirement Account), and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand the Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Offered by employers, often with matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income. Money grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA:** A personal retirement account that you can open independently. There are two main types: Traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (money is taxed upfront, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement). 
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment accounts where you can buy and sell investments without tax advantages. However, you owe taxes on any capital gains or income earned.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match before putting money into other accounts. This is essentially “free money.”

### 3. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - After taking advantage of the match, prioritize contributions to an IRA or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket now. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more advantageous.

### 4. **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
   - In a **401(k)** and **IRA**, focus on investments that grow in value over time (like stocks) since the growth is tax-deferred or tax-free (Roth).
   - In a **taxable account**, consider holding investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs which typically generate lower capital gains than actively traded stocks.

### 5. **Assess Your Financial Goals:**
   - If you're saving for retirement, prioritize your 401(k) and IRA contributions. If you have short-term goals (like buying a house), you might want to put more money in your taxable account for liquidity.

### 6. **Establish an Overall Contribution Strategy:**
   - Create a balanced approach that considers your current expenses, debt, and savings goals. A common strategy might include:
     - Maxing out contributions to a 401(k) up to the match.
     - Funding a Roth IRA (or Traditional IRA) up to the maximum limit.
     - Allocating any remaining funds to a taxable investment account.

### 7. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Your financial situation can change, so revisit your distribution strategy annually or after any major life changes (new job, marriage, etc.).

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions across these different accounts requires careful consideration of your current financial situation, tax implications, and long-term goals. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
