The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money. After that, consider contributing up to the annual limit.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA, as these accounts also provide tax advantages. The choice between a Roth and Traditional IRA depends on whether you prefer tax benefits now (Traditional) or during retirement (Roth).

### 2. **Fund Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to a taxable investment account. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals but don't have the same tax benefits.

### 3. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**
   - If you’re closer to retirement, prioritize accounts that offer tax benefits and low withdrawal penalties. If you’re younger, you may prefer to maximize growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing from these accounts in retirement. Ideally, your withdrawals should be strategically planned to minimize tax liability. 

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review your allocations across accounts to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance. 

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **20% in 401(k)** (to maximize employer match)
- **10% in IRA** (as a separate retirement vehicle)
- **70% in taxable accounts** (for flexibility and short-term goals)

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the ideal distribution strategy will vary based on your unique financial situation. It might also be helpful to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
