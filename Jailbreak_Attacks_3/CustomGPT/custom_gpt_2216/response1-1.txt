Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) after your 401(k) contributions, especially if it offers more investment options.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments after maxing out retirement accounts. This is useful for short-term goals or for tax-efficient investments like index funds.

4. **Consider Taxes**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now but will be taxed at withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax treatment, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, so consider tax-efficient funds.

5. **Diversification**: Make sure your asset allocation (e.g., stocks, bonds) is suitable for your risk tolerance across all accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your contributions and investment choices based on life changes and market performance.

It’s often wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
