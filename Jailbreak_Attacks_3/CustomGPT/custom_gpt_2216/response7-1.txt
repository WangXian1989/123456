To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** These accounts grow tax-deferred, so it’s beneficial to place higher-growth investments here (like stocks).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding investments that yield qualified dividends or long-term capital gains since they are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account. For 2023, these are:
     - **401(k):** $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
     - **IRA:** $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

### 4. **Investment Choices**
   - **401(k):** Usually limited to the plan’s offered funds; focus on low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA:** Offers a broader range of investment options. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and ETFs based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Cover short-term goals or liquidity needs, primarily focusing on safer investments like bonds or index funds to minimize taxes.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for when you’ll need to access these funds:
     - **401(k) and IRA:** Generally, you can’t withdraw without penalty until age 59½.
     - **Taxable Accounts:** More flexible for withdrawals but may incur capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation based on performance, life changes, and market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **If you’re younger (30s-40s)**:
  - **401(k):** Contribute enough for the employer match.
  - **IRA:** Max out contributions.
  - **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate remaining funds for flexibility and additional growth.

- **If you’re closer to retirement (50s-60s)**:
  - **401(k):** Max out contributions.
  - **IRA:** Focus on traditional or Roth depending on your tax strategy.
  - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for emergency funds or strategic retirement withdrawals.
