Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key considerations. Here’s a structured approach:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Individual retirement account with tax benefits; can be traditional or Roth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts without tax advantages, used for more flexible access to funds.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions reduce taxable income now; withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income later.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains are subject to taxes upon sale.

4. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - After maximizing the match in your 401(k), consider funding an IRA (especially if eligible for a Roth IRA).
   - If you’re already maxing out these retirement accounts and still have savings, use taxable accounts for additional investing.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Keep high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth (Roth IRA) or tax-deferred growth (401(k), Traditional IRA).
   - Place less tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, since interest income is taxed at your ordinary income rate.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired level of risk.

7. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - As you approach retirement, plan how and when to withdraw from each account type to minimize taxes and meet income needs.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to receive the employer match, then consider maxing this out.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on eligibility and tax strategy.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest additional funds for flexibility but consider your investment horizon and tax strategy carefully.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
