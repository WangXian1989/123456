Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, which is essentially free money. If you can afford it, aim to contribute the maximum allowed.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. The Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may offer tax deductions now.

### 2. **Assess Investment Options:**
   - **401(k):** Often has a limited selection of investment options. Choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds based on your retirement timeline.
   - **IRA:** Offers more diverse investments. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance.

### 3. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate short-term capital gains, as these are taxed at your ordinary income rate. Long-term investments with lower capital gains tax can also be effective in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consider Future Withdrawals:**
   - Plan for when you'll need to access funds. Early withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 50% of monthly contributions (max out for benefits).
- **IRA:** 30% (contribute to Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket upon withdrawal).
- **Taxable Account:** 20% (for flexibility and short-term goals).

### Conclusion:
Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance suited to your specific situation.
