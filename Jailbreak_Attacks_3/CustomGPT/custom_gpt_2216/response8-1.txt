To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're under 50, aim to contribute up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023). If over 50, you can contribute an extra $7,500 as a catch-up.
   - **IRA**: Consider opening a Roth IRA if you qualify. If not, contribute to a traditional IRA, aiming for the limit ($6,500 for 2023, plus an additional $1,000 if you're over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts, focusing on:
   - Long-term investments to benefit from lower capital gains tax.
   - Tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize distributions.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, higher-risk investments can be situated in tax-deferred accounts, while lower-risk, income-generating investments may belong in taxable accounts.

5. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your allocations and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Consider Professional Advice**: If you're unsure of your strategy, consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your individual needs.

This approach helps optimize tax efficiency and supports your long-term financial goals.
