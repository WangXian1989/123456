Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax bracket, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Account Types**
   - **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA:** Depending on your income, consider whether a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) is more beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term goals or investments that benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRAs:** Often offer tax-advantaged growth. Consider a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax impacts.

### 4. **Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Taxes are deferred until withdrawal, beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are taxed, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, making it ideal for anticipated higher future income.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a savings account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### 6. **Regular Reassessments**
   - Review your distribution strategy periodically to adapt to changes in income, goals, or market conditions.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Contribute enough to 401(k) to get full employer match.**
2. **Max out IRA contributions (traditional or Roth based on your situation).**
3. **Allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts, focusing on growth-oriented investments.**

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor your approach to your unique situation.
