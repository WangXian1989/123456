The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. The Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **401(k)**: Choose a mix of funds that match your risk tolerance (stocks, bonds, etc.). Look for low-cost index funds when possible.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may have lower tax implications (e.g., long-term investments). You may also consider tax-efficient funds or ETFs.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling securities. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate, so holding investments for over a year can be beneficial.
   - **IRA Distribution**: Be aware of the tax implications of withdrawing from your traditional IRA versus your Roth IRA in retirement.

4. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure that you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these investment accounts (typically 3-6 months of living expenses) before investing aggressively.

By comprehensively considering your financial situation and goals, you can create a strategy that effectively balances your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
