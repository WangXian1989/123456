Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts are often tax-deferred or tax-deductible (depending on the account type), which can benefit you if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any gains in these accounts will be taxed in the year they are realized. However, they offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Consider how to allocate your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets. This can be across all three accounts to tailor risk levels according to your needs.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily in these accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid form, which is often outside of these accounts.

5. **Taxable Investments for Short-Term Goals**: If you have goals within the next 5 years (like buying a house), consider keeping those funds in a taxable account for easier access without penalties.

6. **Long-term vs Short-term**: Put higher-risk investments (like stocks) in accounts with tax advantages (401(k), IRA) for long-term growth, while potentially keeping conservative investments in taxable accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Everyone's situation is different and a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.

Always consider adjusting your strategy based on changes in your financial situation or tax laws over time.
