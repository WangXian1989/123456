The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon for investing. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money." Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if financially feasible.
   - **IRA**: Consider doing a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a traditional IRA if you want the tax deduction now. 

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Taxable accounts can be advantageous for short-term needs and allow for more flexibility in withdrawals without penalties. However, they are subject to capital gains taxes. Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) or hold investments longer to benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different investment types (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) should be spread out to reduce risk.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance to maintain your desired risk level. This could involve selling off assets in one account to put funds into another area to maintain your target allocation.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan how you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Generally, it might be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to minimize taxes.

6. **Consider Life Events and Changes**:
   - Life events (like marriage, children, job changes) can impact how you should allocate your investments. Be adaptable and ready to adjust your strategy as needed.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances. They can help you create a strategy that aligns with your overall financial goals.
