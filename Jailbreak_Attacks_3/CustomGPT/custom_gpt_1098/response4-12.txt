I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options vary depending on the specific liver condition, so it's essential to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan from a qualified medical professional. Common treatments may include lifestyle changes, medications, or procedures depending on the severity and type of liver problem.
