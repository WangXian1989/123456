Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match in the 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and goals). These accounts can provide tax benefits, either now or in retirement.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: 
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA (where contributions are made post-tax) might be advantageous.
   - Conversely, if you think your tax rate will be lower in retirement, a traditional IRA or 401(k) (pre-tax contributions) can be beneficial.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After funding tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment options, though youâ€™ll owe capital gains taxes on profits.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investment allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) is diversified across all accounts to spread risk.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically evaluate your investments and contributions to ensure they align with your changing goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider getting personalized advice from a financial planner who can tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

Ultimately, the right distribution balance will depend on your individual circumstances, including your age, income level, and retirement goals.
