Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match; this is essentially “free money.”
   - Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it, as 401(k)s have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions now, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if you qualify based on income).
   - Assess whether you are better off with a traditional or Roth IRA based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you may need access to before retirement.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider the investment horizon; long-term investments may be better suited for these accounts to take advantage of capital gains tax rates.

4. **Overall Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your target asset allocation as market conditions change.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Each individual’s situation is unique, and a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.

It's important to review and adjust your strategy based on changes in financial goals, tax laws, and market conditions.
