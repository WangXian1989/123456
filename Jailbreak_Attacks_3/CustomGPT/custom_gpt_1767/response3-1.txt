To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies, tailored to your financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the match, then consider maximizing contributions to an IRA.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or Roth IRA (after-tax) aligns better with your future tax expectations.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've taken advantage of tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility. This could include a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds that fit your risk tolerance.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts, as they generate less taxable income.
   - Hold less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts where interest can grow tax-deferred.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Future Tax Brackets**: Think about your retirement income needs and potential tax bracket at retirement when deciding how much to allocate to each account type.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For tailored advice considering your entire financial landscape, consult a financial advisor.

This balanced approach helps maximize growth while managing tax implications.
