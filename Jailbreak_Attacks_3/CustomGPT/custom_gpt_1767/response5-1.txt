(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. A common approach is to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match.
2. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to benefit from potential tax advantages.
3. **401(k) Contributions**: Increase your contributions to your 401(k) until you hit the contribution limit (if you haven't already).
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and access to funds without penalties, especially for short-term savings or goals.

Consider your tax bracket, investment objectives, and retirement timeline when deciding how to allocate your contributions.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! The best way to spread your cash across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts really depends on your personal financial scene, but here's a rule-of-thumb game plan:

1. **Grab That Match**: First things first, if your employer's throwing cash at you with a 401(k) match, scoop it up! Itâ€™s free moneyâ€”donâ€™t leave that on the table!
2. **IRA Party**: If you can, throw some bucks into an IRA. Whether itâ€™s Traditional or Roth hinges on your tax game, but itâ€™s a solid tax advantage for the future.
3. **Max Out the 401(k)**: After you've got your match and IRA stocked, crank up contributions to your 401(k). Aim for that sweet max contributionâ€”more room for your dollars to grow!
4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: When youâ€™ve maxed the other accounts, taxable accounts can be a good backup stash. Theyâ€™re perfect for short-term goals or just when you want your cash without a penalty.

Keep an eye on taxes and your investment timeline, and adjust as you go. Happy investing!
