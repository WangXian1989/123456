To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional) next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that produce low taxes (like index funds) to minimize tax liabilities.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a mix of asset types across your accounts to balance risk and return. This includes stocks, bonds, and alternative investments.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your investment allocations to stay aligned with your financial goals based on performance and changing life circumstances.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Think about which accounts you might withdraw from first in retirement. Tax considerations can significantly impact your withdrawals.

6. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Align your investment choices within each account with your risk appetite and how soon youâ€™ll need to access the money.

7. **Stay Informed on Fees**:
   - Be mindful of fees associated with your 401(k) and IRA options, as high fees can eat into your returns.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice taking into account your entire financial picture.

This structured approach will help you optimize your money distribution effectively.
