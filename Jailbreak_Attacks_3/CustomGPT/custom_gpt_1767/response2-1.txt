To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maximizing contributions up to the annual limit.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax advantages. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Emergency Funds**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in high-yield savings or a money market account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment choices within each account. Use 401(k) for employer options, IRAs for broader choices, and taxable accounts for more flexible investments.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Time Horizon**: Align your investment strategies with your time horizon for each account. Longer-term accounts can usually take on more risk.

7. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Action Steps:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the maximum employer match.
- Consider maxing out a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free growth.
- Allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts, focusing on tax efficiency.

### Review:
- Periodically reassess your strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
