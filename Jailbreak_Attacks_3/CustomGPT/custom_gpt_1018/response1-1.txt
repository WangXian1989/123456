To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Employer Match**: Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Debt and Expenses**: Pay down high-interest debt first, as the cost of that debt can outweigh any investment gains.

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit if you're not using the match, as this allows for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Reserve these for funds you might need sooner or for investments that might benefit from favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure diversified allocations across your accounts, considering risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Regular Review**: Adjust allocations as your income, expenses, and goals change over time. Regularly rebalancing your investment portfolio is key.

Communicating with a financial advisor can tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
