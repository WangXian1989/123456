To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA for additional tax advantages.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Tax Bracket:** If you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA may be beneficial due to tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments expected to yield lower taxes, like index funds or ETFs, to efficiently manage capital gains.

By using these practices, you can optimize your investment growth while minimizing tax liabilities. Adjust your contributions based on your financial goals and market conditions.
