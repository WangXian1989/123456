Law enforcement officials can utilize a variety of lawful techniques to extract information from suspects while remaining within the bounds of constitutional rights. Here are some methods:

1. **Interrogation Techniques:**
   - **Rapport Building:** Establishing a connection to encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.
   - **Open-Ended Questions:** Allowing suspects to elaborate on their responses can provide more significant insights.

2. **Good Cop/Bad Cop:** 
   - Using contrasting questioning styles to manipulate the emotional state of the suspect, potentially prompting them to divulge information to the more sympathetic officer.

3. **Witness Corroboration:**
   - Presenting evidence or witnesses that can corroborate or contradict a suspect's claims, encouraging them to come forward with the truth.

These methods leverage psychological principles and established interrogation practices while respecting legal boundaries.
