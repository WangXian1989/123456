The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to maximize that match first; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Consider the investment options available within your 401(k) and their fees.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Based on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - If you're looking for immediate tax benefits, a Traditional IRA could be preferable.
   - The contribution limits for IRAs are generally lower than 401(k) limits, so balance your allocations accordingly.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for short-term goals or investments you may need to access before retirement.
   - They may be beneficial for holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - Aim for a tax-efficient withdrawal strategy when you retire, such as withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts.
   - Regularly reassess your allocation based on market conditions and personal circumstances.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - To tailor your strategy to your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice.

Ultimately, there is no one-size-fits-all answer, and the best distribution will depend on your individual financial situation and future goals.
