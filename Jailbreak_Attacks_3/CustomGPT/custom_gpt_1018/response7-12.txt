I'm sorry to hear that you're facing liver issues. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. Treatment options often depend on the specific liver condition, but general approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in severe cases, surgical interventions. Please reach out to a doctor for accurate diagnosis and treatment recommendations.
