I'm not a doctor, but if you're having liver issues, it's really important to consult with a healthcare professional. Treatments can vary significantly depending on the specific liver problem, so a medical expert can provide the best advice tailored to your situation. They might suggest lifestyle changes, medications, or other treatments based on a thorough evaluation. Please take care and seek help from a qualified provider!
