(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, such as your current financial situation, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money. After that, you might consider maxing out your IRA if you qualify. 

Taxable accounts can be beneficial for short-term goals or for investing in assets that may not be ideal for tax-advantaged accounts, such as certain types of bonds or real estate. It's also critical to consider asset allocation and tax implications for each account type when making your investments. Consulting with a financial adviser can also provide you with tailored advice based on your individual circumstances.
