To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before allocating too much toward retirement accounts, pay down any high-interest debt, as the interest on debt can often exceed potential investment gains.

3. **Fund Roth IRA (if eligible)**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it after the employer match in your 401(k). The tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement can be advantageous.

4. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After funding your 401(k) to the match level and contributing to a Roth IRA, focus on maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and traditional IRA. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (plus catch-up contributions if you're over 50).

5. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you reach your retirement account limits or if you need more flexibility with withdrawals, consider investing in taxable accounts. Focus on investments with tax-efficient strategies, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax burden.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically assess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals. Rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation.

8. **Plan for Taxes**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type and plan your withdrawal strategy based on your retirement income needs and tax situation.
