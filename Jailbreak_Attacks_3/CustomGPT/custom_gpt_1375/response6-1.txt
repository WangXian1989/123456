Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be strategized to optimize tax benefits and investment growth. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that—it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that yield favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains) or for funds you might need before retirement. 
   - **Dividend Stocks or Index Funds**: These can minimize tax impact while still allowing for growth.

3. **Balance Contributions**:
   - Allocate funds based on your age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. Typically, the younger you are, the more aggressively you can invest in stocks within these accounts.
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to accommodate changing life circumstances and market conditions.

Always consult a financial adviser to tailor these strategies to your specific situation, as individual circumstances can vary widely.
