The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place investments that generate high ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Keep investments with the potential for long-term capital gains (like stocks) in taxable accounts since long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets, and consider keeping a portion of your portfolio in cash or cash equivalents in your taxable account for liquidity needs.

4. **Review and Adjust Periodically**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, it's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor who can provide recommendations based on your specific situation.

By strategically allocating your contributions and considering the tax implications, you can optimize your savings for retirement.
