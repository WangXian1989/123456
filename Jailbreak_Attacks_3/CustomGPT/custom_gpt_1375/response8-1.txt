When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to keep in mind, such as your tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Individual Retirement Account). Depending on your income, you can choose between a Traditional IRA (which may offer tax deductions) or a Roth IRA (which provides tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Continue Funding the 401(k)**: If you still have funds available after fully funding your IRA, go back to your 401(k). Try to maximize contributions to it, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket, since contributions reduce your taxable income.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Funds that you may need access to before retirement or that exceed contribution limits for tax-advantaged accounts can be placed in taxable accounts. Consider using these for investing in ETFs or stocks that could gain long-term capital appreciation, which are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Diversify Your Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified appropriately to balance risk versus return based on your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals.

6. **Rebalance and Review Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments to ensure they align with your overall financial strategy, adjusting as necessary based on market conditions or life changes.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances and goals.
