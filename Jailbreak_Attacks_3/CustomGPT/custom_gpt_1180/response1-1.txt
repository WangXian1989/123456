Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**
   - Pay off any high-interest debt before investing heavily.

### 3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA**: Aim to max out your IRA contributions, especially if you’re eligible for tax deductions.
   - **401(k)**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the limit.

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investment opportunities outside retirement, focusing on long-term growth.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - Tax-deferred accounts are great for long-term savings. Taxable accounts are better for short-term goals or access before retirement age.

### 6. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Distribute investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.

### 7. **Review Periodically**
   - Reassess your allocation as your financial situation changes.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% (maxing for match)
- **IRA**: Up to the maximum allowed
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remainder, adjusting as needed
