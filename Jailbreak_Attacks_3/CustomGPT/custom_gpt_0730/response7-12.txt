I'm not a doctor, but I can give you some general information on treatment options for liver problems, which may vary depending on the specific condition. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan. Here are some common treatment options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Dietary modifications (reduced sugar, low-fat, high-fiber diets)
   - Avoiding alcohol and harmful substances
   - Regular exercise

2. **Medications**: Specific medications may be prescribed depending on the liver condition (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease).

3. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgical procedures may be required, such as liver transplantation for severe liver failure.

4. **Management of Underlying Conditions**: Treating conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or fatty liver disease can be crucial.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up appointments to monitor liver function and any changes in your condition.

It's crucial to speak with a healthcare provider who can assess your specific situation and recommend the most appropriate treatment options.
