When determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it typically depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach you could consider:

1. **401(k) Contribution**:
   - Max out any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing up to the limit if you can afford it. This is a pre-tax account, which can lower your taxable income now.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - After your 401(k), consider funding a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer you immediate tax benefits, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Aim to max out contributions if possible, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once your retirement accounts are maximized, allocate extra funds to taxable accounts for more flexible access to your investments.
   - Use these accounts for investments that might generate lower tax consequences, like long-term capital gains or qualified dividends.

4. **Consider Your Age and Goals**:
   - If you are younger, you might favor growth investments potentially found in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - As retirement nears, shift focus to more stable investments to preserve capital in these accounts.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and ensure optimal tax efficiency over time.
