Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is free money). Ideally, aim for the maximum contribution limit.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.

2. **Consider Taxation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, which can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. This can include index funds or long-term investments.
   - Prioritize high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes until retirement.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Diversify your investments in stocks, bonds, and other assets for risk management.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, tax-advantaged accounts should be tapped last to maximize their growth potential.

5. **Regular Review:**
   - Review and adjust your allocations regularly based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

In summary, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, balance your investments, and regularly reassess your strategy. It's also beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for a personalized plan.
