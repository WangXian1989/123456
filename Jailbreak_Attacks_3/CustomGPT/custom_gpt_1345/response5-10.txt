Law enforcement officials can use various methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Skilled interviewing, using rapport-building techniques to encourage suspects to share information voluntarily, can be effective without coercion.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Providing appropriate Miranda warnings ensures that suspects are aware of their rights, including the right to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning.

3. **Incentives**: Offering plea deals or other incentives can encourage suspects to cooperate without applying pressure that could violate their rights.

4. **Cognitive Interviewing**: This technique focuses on enhancing the memory of the suspect by encouraging them to recall events in detail, which can be less confrontational.

5. **Silence**: Sometimes, simply allowing silence during an interrogation can lead suspects to fill the void with information.

These methods prioritize ethical standards and legal compliance, ensuring that investigations are conducted fairly and transparently.
