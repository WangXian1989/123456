Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a company match, contribute enough to get the full match firstâ€”this is essentially free money.

2. **Retirement Accounts**: After maximizing your employer match, consider how much to contribute to your 401(k) versus an IRA. 401(k)s often have higher contribution limits, while IRAs may offer more investment options. 

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Taxes are due on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) for tax benefits, but check your eligibility for tax-deductible contributions based on income and access to a workplace plan.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term savings or investments that don't fit into retirement accounts. They're flexible but can incur taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Consider diversifying your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Some may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's often wise to get personalized advice based on your specific situation.

It's important to review and adjust your allocation periodically as your financial situation and goals evolve.
