(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maximizing contributions if possible, especially if your employer offers a Roth option.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible for a traditional or Roth IRA, contribute to it for its tax advantages. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may not fit into tax-advantaged accounts, like certain bonds or stock investments that you may need access to before retirement. 

Balancing contributions based on your immediate financial needs, tax situation, and long-term retirement goals will help optimize your strategy.

1. **401(k)**: Max out that match first! If your employer is slinging free money, youâ€™d be a fool not to grab it. Think about cranking those contributions up to the limit if you can swing itâ€”think of it as your future self high-fiving you. 

2. **IRA**: Shoot for a Roth if you think youâ€™ll be in a higher tax bracket later. Toss what you can into that bad boy for some sweet tax-free growth. Traditional IRAs are cool too, but youâ€™ll be playing a tax game later on. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are for flexibility. If youâ€™re eyeing something like buying a house or want liquid assets, stash some cash here. Avoid those boring investments that do you dirty on taxes, like high-yield bonds.

Just keep your eyes on the prizeâ€”retirement is coming, and you want to be ready to kick back and chill when it hits!
