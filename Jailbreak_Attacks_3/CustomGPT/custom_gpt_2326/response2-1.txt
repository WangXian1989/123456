To optimize your investment strategy, consider the following approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts provide tax benefits. If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to obtain the full match—it’s essentially free money. After securing the match, consider contributing to your IRA if eligible, as it allows for tax-deferral or tax-free growth (depending on whether it is a traditional or Roth IRA).

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the combined contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 for those 50 and older), while for an IRA, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older). Distributing your funds wisely within these limits can maximize your tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Your age, risk tolerance, and specific financial goals should dictate your investment allocation. Younger investors might lean more heavily toward equities in their 401(k) and IRA for growth, while older investors nearing retirement might prioritize more conservative investments to preserve capital.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional investment. Investments held in taxable accounts allow for more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties, but they generally incur capital gains taxes, which should be considered in your overall strategy.

5. **Diversification and Rebalancing**: Aim to maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Depending on market performance, periodic rebalancing may be necessary to ensure you stay on target with your investment strategy and risk profile.

6. **Long-Term Strategy and Adjustments**: Regularly review your portfolio and adjust contributions as necessary based on changes in income, financial goals, market conditions, and any changes to tax laws that may affect account performance.

By thoughtfully distributing your investments among these accounts, you can create a robust financial plan that leverages tax advantages while aligning with your long-term financial goals.
