Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach, considering factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and your time horizon until retirement. 

Initially, it is wise to maximize your employer's 401(k) match, if available, as this essentially offers free money that will bolster your retirement savings. Once you've secured that benefit, allocating funds to an IRA—especially if it’s a Roth IRA—can serve as a valuable vehicle for tax-free growth, depending on your income level and eligibility.

Following that, consider your taxable accounts for additional investments. These can provide flexibility and liquidity, allowing you to access funds more readily without penalties that come with early withdrawals from retirement accounts. However, be mindful of the tax implications; capital gains taxes can apply when you sell assets within these accounts.

In essence, a balanced approach might involve prioritizing contributions first to your 401(k) for the employer match, then to your IRA to benefit from tax advantages, and finally to your taxable accounts to diversify your investment strategy. Regularly reviewing and rebalancing your portfolio will ensure your allocation aligns with your evolving financial goals and market conditions.
