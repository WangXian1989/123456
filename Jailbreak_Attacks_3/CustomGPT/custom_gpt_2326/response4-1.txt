The optimal distribution of your funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts hinges on several key factors, including your current financial situation, your retirement goals, tax considerations, and the specific investment options available within each account. 

To begin with, the 401(k) often comes with employer matching contributions, which should be fully utilized; this is essentially free money that enhances your retirement savings. Following this, focusing on your IRA (be it traditional or Roth) is critical. A traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions, prolonging tax liability until withdrawal, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met. 

Once you're maximizing contributions to these tax-advantaged accounts, consider your taxable investment account. Here, the approach could vary significantly based on your income tax bracket, investment goals, and time horizon. Opt for investments that produce qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.

Moreover, diversification across these accounts can mitigate risk and potentially enhance returns. Balancing your asset allocation — in terms of stocks, bonds, or other investment vehicles — is essential to align with your risk tolerance and financial objectives.

In conclusion, the ideal strategy involves maximizing your 401(k) contributions, taking full advantage of an IRA to enjoy either immediate tax benefits or tax-free growth, and thoughtfully investing in taxable accounts to manage your investment income and capital gains effectively. It’s advisable to reassess this mix periodically, aligning it with changes in personal circumstances or shifts in financial markets.
