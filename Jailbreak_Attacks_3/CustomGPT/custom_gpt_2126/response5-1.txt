(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. A common approach is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) to take advantage of potential tax benefits. Finally, any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. It's important to evaluate your asset allocation based on risk tolerance and time horizon, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
