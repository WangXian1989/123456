The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. However, here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially "free money".

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maxing out the employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions depending on your income level, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: If you still have funds to invest after maxing out your IRA, consider contributing more to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. This can further reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties, though you'll need to be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Investment Strategy**: Depending on your timeline and risk tolerance, diversify your investments in a way that balances growth and risk. Generally, higher-risk investments can be better suited for accounts that are intended for long-term growth (like your 401(k) and IRA) versus those that may be tapped earlier (taxable accounts).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your investment allocations and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy across all accounts.

7. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider the tax implications of different investments. For example, holding bond funds or real estate investment trusts (REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts may be more tax-efficient than holding them in taxable accounts.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor or tax professional can provide personalized insights tailored to your financial situation and goals.
