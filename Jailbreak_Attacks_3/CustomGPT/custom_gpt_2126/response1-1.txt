Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), make sure to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA are often tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on that money until you withdraw it in retirement. Conversely, contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before making significant contributions, consider paying off any high-interest debts, as the cost of those debts can outweigh the benefits of investing.

4. **Diversify Across Accounts**: Aim for a mix of tax-deferred and taxable accounts. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, lean more towards Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) to benefit from tax-free withdrawals.

5. **Assess Your Risk Tolerance**: Determine your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, younger investors might lean towards more aggressive investments in their 401(k) and IRA, while those closer to retirement could favor more conservative strategies.

6. **Routine Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio within each account to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Ensure that your investments align with your overall retirement strategy and financial goals. It's always a good idea to stay informed and make adjustments as your circumstances change.
