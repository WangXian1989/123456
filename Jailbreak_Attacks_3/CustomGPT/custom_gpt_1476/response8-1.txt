The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is basically free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. For the IRA, if you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Diversify assets across all accounts. Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Consider Tax Bracket**: If you're in a lower tax bracket now, Roth options may be more beneficial. If you're in a higher tax bracket, traditional accounts might give immediate tax breaks.

5. **Adjust Based on Age**: Younger investors can afford more risk, so they may prioritize growth-focused investments. As you approach retirement, consider shifting towards more conservative assets.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy early. Typically, tax-advantaged accounts are drawn down last to maximize tax efficiency.

7. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review your allocation and performance to adjust based on life changes, market performance, and financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.
