To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money). Aim for the annual limit if financially feasible.
   - **IRA**: Fund a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Prioritize Roth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Asset Allocation by Account Type**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impacts. Consider municipal bonds or index funds.
   - **Retirement Accounts**: Focus on higher-growth investments (like stocks) since withdrawals are taxed at your income rate in retirement.

### 3. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust the asset allocation across accounts to maintain your desired risk level, ensuring no account is disproportionately weighted towards one asset class.

By effectively utilizing tax strategies and optimizing growth potential within each account type, you can enhance your overall returns and reduce tax liability over time.
