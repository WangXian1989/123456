Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're in a high tax bracket, prioritize contributions here since they lower your taxable income. 
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

3. **Build a Taxable Account**:
   - Consider your short-term goals and liquidity needs. Use taxable accounts for investments that may be needed sooner or for tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs with low turnover).

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Keep riskier investments (higher anticipated growth) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for lower-growth investments where capital gains could be taxed less.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Understand the tax consequences of withdrawals and capital gains for each account type.
