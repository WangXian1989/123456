Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing the maximum allowed, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket. 
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for flexibility. They can be beneficial for short-term goals or as an emergency fund.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment choices within these accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations at least annually to ensure they align with your long-term goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.

This approach balances immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential.
