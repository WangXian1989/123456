Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on maxing out these accounts first, especially if you have a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The tax benefits can significantly enhance your investment growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, as it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, focus on taxable accounts. These provide greater flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices, though you'll incur capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to minimize risk.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of your withdrawals. For instance, withdrawing from a taxable account might incur capital gains tax, while 401(k) withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your portfolio and rebalance periodically to stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consider seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor, who can help tailor a strategy to your specific needs.

Adjust your contributions as your financial situation and goals evolve.
