Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and tax situation. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund IRA:**
   - If eligible, prioritize maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) for tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt:**
   - If you have debt at high interest rates, consider using some funds to pay that down before investing.

4. **Contribute More to 401(k):**
   - Once youâ€™ve maxed out your IRA, increase contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

5. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for any additional savings. This is useful for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts, considering tax implications. For example, place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

7. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting a financial advisor can tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
