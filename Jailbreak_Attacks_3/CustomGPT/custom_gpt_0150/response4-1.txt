To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these tips:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Next, consider maximizing contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Use tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) for investments with high growth potential, as you'll delay taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate regular income or short-term gains, as these are taxed annually.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Keep higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolios across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you'll withdraw from each account type to minimize tax impact, especially during retirement.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Consider talking to a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial goals and tax situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create an effective distribution strategy for your investments.
