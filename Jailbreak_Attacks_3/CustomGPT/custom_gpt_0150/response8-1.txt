To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Invest in a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, which is ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Focus on Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Use this for higher-risk investments due to tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider more stable investments since withdrawals may be taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient ETFs or index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, tailored to your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed based on market conditions and your financial goals.

This balanced approach helps optimize tax efficiency and prepares you for a comfortable retirement.
