Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maximizing 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Traditional Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions are tax-deferred; taxes are paid upon withdrawal. This may be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free. This is advantageous if you believe your tax rate will increase in the future.

### 3. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts Last**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are less tax-efficient, such as stocks or ETFs that produce qualified dividends. 

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments, such as stocks or funds that you can hold for years without worrying about short-term volatility.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider a diversified mix but be mindful of tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Reassess your allocation periodically based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement plans.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of salary until the match is maximized.
- **Roth IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable each year if below income limits.
- **Taxable Account**: Use additional funds for investing once tax-advantaged accounts are at capacity.
