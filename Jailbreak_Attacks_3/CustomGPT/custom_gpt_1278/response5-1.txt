Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your age, income, tax bracket, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Consider Your Tax Situation**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Understand the annual contribution limits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for investments you might need before retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **Suggested Distribution Strategy:**
1. **Contribute enough to your 401(k)** to get your employer match.
2. **Max out your IRA contributions** if feasible.
3. **Invest in taxable accounts** once you’ve maxed contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

### **Review Regularly**
Monitor and adjust your allocations based on market conditions, changes in income, and life events.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
For personalized guidance based on your unique situation and goals.
