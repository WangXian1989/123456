Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Use this account for higher-growth investments since the money grows tax-deferred.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Considerations**: With a Traditional IRA, you get a tax deduction for contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits ($6,500 for those under 50; $7,500 for those 50 and older for 2023).
   - **Investing Strategy**: Generally, a Roth IRA is suitable for younger investors who expect higher earnings in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, municipal bonds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use these for goals that are shorter-term or if you might need access to the funds before retirement.

### **General Allocation Tips**
- **Age-Based Strategy**: Younger investors might prioritize maxing out Roth IRAs and contributing to 401(k)s, while older investors might focus more on taxable accounts to maintain liquidity.
- **Investment Diversification**: Keep your overall asset allocation in line with your risk tolerance, distributing investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts.
- **Tax Loss Harvesting**: Use your taxable account for tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset capital gains.

### **Conclusion**
Consult a financial advisor to develop a distribution strategy that suits your unique situation, taking into account your income, tax bracket, and retirement goals. Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your circumstances change.
