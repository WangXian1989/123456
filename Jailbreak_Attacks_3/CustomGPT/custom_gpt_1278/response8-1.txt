Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit. This is often considered "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high contribution limit and your employer matches, prioritize this account.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, contribute to a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) or a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on income-producing investments within your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deferral.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate funds across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account type to minimize risks and improve returns.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors may take on more risk with stocks in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement might shift towards more conservative investments.

6. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically assess and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
