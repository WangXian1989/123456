Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Traditional grows tax-deferred; you'll owe taxes on withdrawals.
   - **IRA:** Similar to 401(k) in tax treatment. Traditional IRAs offer tax deferrals, while Roths provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains taxes and dividends are taxed annually.

2. **Investment Goals and Timeline:**
   - **Short-term needs:** Money in taxable accounts is more accessible without penalties.
   - **Long-term growth:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).

3. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) if you have an employer match.
   - Contribute to your IRA after maximizing your 401(k), focusing on Roth if eligible.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risks.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. You may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, to manage tax brackets.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
1. **Maximize employer match in 401(k).**
2. **Contribute to IRA (preferably Roth if eligible).**
3. **Invest in taxable accounts as needed.**
