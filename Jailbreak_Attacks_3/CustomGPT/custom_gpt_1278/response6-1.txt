Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves understanding the advantages and limitations of each. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible ($22,500 per year for those under 50 in 2024, $30,000 for those 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth). The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 per year ($7,500 if age 50 or older in 2024). Choose based on your income and tax situation (Roth for tax-free withdrawals, traditional for tax deduction).

### 2. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts offer greater liquidity and fewer penalties for withdrawals.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on low-turnover index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Bracket**: If you're currently in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA). 
   - **Future Tax Expectations**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, favor traditional accounts. Conversely, if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket, prioritize Roth accounts.

### 4. **Diversification of Investment Types**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, focusing on stocks, bonds, and other assets suited to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### Summary
- **Prioritize contributions** to your 401(k) and IRA first.
- **Use taxable accounts** to supplement investments once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out.
- **Tailor your strategy** based on your tax situation and future expectations.

This approach can help optimize your retirement savings while managing tax implications effectively.
