Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (essentially free money).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Max out contributions if you’re eligible. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRAs:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed, impacting your overall return.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k):** Often includes a range of mutual funds or ETFs; diversify among stocks, bonds, and target-date funds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA:** Similar diversification strategy, but you have a broader choice of investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider using this for investments that may generate lower taxes, like index funds or tax-efficient funds.

### 4. **Consider Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**
   - Younger investors might lean more heavily towards stocks in both tax-advantaged and taxable accounts.
   - As you approach retirement, consider shifting towards more stable, income-generating investments.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically review your allocation and adjust based on performance changes, life events, or changing financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can help tailor your strategy to your specific situation, ensuring you’re taking full advantage of tax benefits and growth opportunities.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 20% (up to the match)
- **Traditional IRA:** 10%
- **Roth IRA:** 10%
- **Taxable Account:** 60% (including cash for short-term needs)

This is just a guideline, so adjust according to your personal financial goals and circumstances.
