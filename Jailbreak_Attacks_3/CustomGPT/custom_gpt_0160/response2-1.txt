Distributing your money wisely among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Focus on maximizing employer matches first.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your short-term and long-term investment goals. 401(k) and IRA funds are generally for retirement, while taxable accounts can be for both short-term and long-term goals.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Allocate stocks, bonds, and other assets to balance growth and stability.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Consider whether you'll need access to your money before retirement. Taxable accounts provide more liquidity than retirement accounts, which may have penalties for early withdrawals.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits: 401(k) and IRA limits differ annually, while taxable accounts have no limits.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match.
2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible for tax-deductible contributions or Roth options.
3. **Beyond Limits**: If you still have funds to invest, consider tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

### Periodic Review:
- Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation as your goals and market conditions change.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
