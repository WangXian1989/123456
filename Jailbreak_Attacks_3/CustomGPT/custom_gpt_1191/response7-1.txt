Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires understanding your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timelines. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Before investing, ensure you have enough cash set aside for emergencies (typically 3-6 months of expenses).

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

### 3. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to both accounts. For 2023, the limits are:
     - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50).
     - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50).

### 4. **Invest Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. 
   - Avoid frequent trading in taxable accounts to limit tax liability.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Reassess your allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consulting a financial advisor can provide clarity and guidance.

This strategy maximizes your retirement savings while considering tax efficiency.
