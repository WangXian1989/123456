To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs have tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the limit is $23,000 for 401(k) contributions (if under age 50), and $6,500 for IRAs.

3. **Invest in Tax-Efficient Ways**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in these accounts due to their tax-advantaged status.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA may be more beneficial. If you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA could be more advantageous.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify within each account to spread risk. Use a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) suited to your risk tolerance.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired investment strategy.

7. **Long-Term Planning**:
   - Align your distribution strategy with your overall retirement goals, considering when you want to retire and your expected expenses in retirement.

Working with a financial advisor can further tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
