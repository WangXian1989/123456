Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maxing out any employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA, in particular, can be advantageous for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These should be used for investments that may yield high taxable income, such as bonds or stock funds that pay dividends, since you'd be taxed on gains annually. 
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** These are better suited for assets expected to grow significantly, as you defer taxes until withdrawal.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Allocate assets based on your risk tolerance. Generally, you'll want a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments across all accounts.
   - For example, you may hold more aggressive growth investments in your 401(k) and IRA, while keeping safer, income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Contribute Up to Max Limits**
   - Aim to maximize contributions to all tax-advantaged accounts each year. For 2024, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $23,000 (and $30,500 if you're over 50), and for IRAs itâ€™s $6,500 (and $7,500 if over 50).

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Revisit your asset allocation regularly. Market performance can change the makeup of your investments, harming your strategy.

### 6. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - Consider your future withdrawal strategy. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **25% 401(k)**
- **25% Traditional or Roth IRA**
- **50% Taxable Accounts**

### Conclusion
Your specific distribution will depend greatly on your personal situation, so consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
