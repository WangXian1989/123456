I'm not a doctor, but I'd recommend consulting with a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver problems. They can evaluate your condition and suggest the best treatment options based on your specific situation. In general, treatments may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, procedures to improve liver health.
