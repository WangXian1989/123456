Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before prioritizing other accounts. This is essentially “free money” for your retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, taxes will apply when you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). The choice affects your tax situation now versus in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment returns in these accounts are taxed annually, so they’re useful for goals outside of retirement or if you expect lower income tax in the future.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have cash or liquid assets set aside for emergencies, which can reduce the need for tapping into retirement accounts prematurely.

4. **Investment Goals**: Consider your time frame for investing. For long-term goals, riskier investments can yield higher returns but may not be suitable for short-term goals due to volatility.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might lean more towards aggressive growth strategies in their 401(k) and IRAs, while older investors may prioritize stability and income in their taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your distribution based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific scenario.
