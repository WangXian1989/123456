Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Prioritize this before other accounts.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement. Traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction now but are taxed upon withdrawal.

2. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - **Long-term goals**: Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA, which are designed for retirement savings.
   - **Short-term goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need sooner, as these allow penalty-free withdrawals.

3. **Adjust Based on Income**:
   - If your income fluctuates, focus on contributions to tax-advantaged accounts in higher-income years to lower your taxable income.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds) across all accounts. This reduces overall risk while taking advantage of each account's benefits.

5. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly assess your allocations based on performance and shifts in your financial situation.
