Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & IRA):**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially “free money.” Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (both Traditional or Roth, depending on your situation).
   - **Consider Tax Bracket:** If you're in a higher tax bracket now, you might prefer Traditional options for their immediate tax deduction. Alternatively, if you expect to be in a higher bracket during retirement, a Roth option could be advantageous.

2. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquid Savings and Flexible Investing:** Once you've optimized your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments or savings. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, which can be useful for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider using tax-efficient investments in these accounts, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains tax implications.

3. **Ongoing Review:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and your personal goals. 

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
