When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA if you qualify. Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Taxable accounts will be subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments. Therefore, holding long-term investments in these accounts can be beneficial.
   - Keep bonds and other income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on interest or dividends.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. This could mean different asset allocations based on risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon**
   - Long-term investments typically belong in tax-advantaged accounts for growth without immediate tax consequences.
   - Shorter-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts where funds can be accessed without penalties.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Financial Goals**
   - Consider your retirement goals, risk tolerance, and expected expenses. Adjust contributions accordingly.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get your employerâ€™s match, then consider contributing more based on your overall budget.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions to your preferred IRA type (Traditional vs. Roth) based on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use excess savings for investments here after maximizing tax-advantaged options.
