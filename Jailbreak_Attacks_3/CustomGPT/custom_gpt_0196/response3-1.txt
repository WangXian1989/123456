To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions up to the limit if you have a strong match. This lowers your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, invest in taxable accounts. This is particularly useful for goals within 5 to 10 years, as you can access funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon in each account type. Consider more growth-oriented investments in tax-deferred accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and adjust as needed based on performance and life changes.

This strategy helps you leverage tax advantages while also providing flexibility for both short-term and long-term financial goals.
