Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about common liver issues and their treatments. Here are a few:

1. **Dietary Changes**: Eating a balanced diet, low in fats and sugars, while increasing fruits and vegetables can help support liver health.

2. **Medication Management**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or cirrhosis), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or prevent further damage.

3. **Lifestyle Modifications**: Reducing alcohol intake, quitting smoking, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly enhance liver function.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider can help monitor your liver function and make necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cancer or serious cirrhosis, surgical options or liver transplantation might be necessary.

Consulting a healthcare professional is crucial for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.
