Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your eligibility. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs can reduce your taxable income now.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for funds you may need in the short term. Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxable, so consider placing your most tax-efficient investments here (e.g., index funds).

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to minimize risk and enhance returns. Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 4. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level, especially after market fluctuations.

### Example Allocation Approach:
- **401(k):** Max out the match, then contribute up to the annual limit.
- **IRA:** Contribute up to the limit for either type based on your eligibility.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate any remaining funds to these accounts, focusing on investments that provide tax efficiency.

### Summary
Ultimately, the best distribution varies by individual circumstances. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to develop a tailored strategy.
