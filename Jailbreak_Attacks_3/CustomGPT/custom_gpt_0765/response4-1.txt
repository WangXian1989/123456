Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k) up to the match limit, as this is effectively "free money."
   - **IRA:** After taking advantage of the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA (depending on your income and tax situation). Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional investing after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility but are taxed on capital gains and dividends.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Bracket:**
   - **Higher Income:** If you are in a higher tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA may be more beneficial than a Roth IRA. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA might be a good choice.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments that may have lower turnover or generate qualified dividends, taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 3. **Consider Investment Type:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Prioritize holding bonds and other fixed-income investments in these accounts to defer taxes on interest income.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Equity investments with the potential for long-term capital appreciation can be held here since qualified long-term capital gains are taxed favorably.

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquid assets (not in retirement accounts) for emergencies. Generally, this should cover 3 to 6 months of living expenses.

### 5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Conduct annual reviews of your distribution strategy to adjust for changes in income, tax laws, financial goals, or market performance.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full match.
- **IRA:** Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible, or a Traditional IRA to reduce taxable income.
- **Taxable Account:** Allocate any remaining funds here for liquidity and flexibility.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for a personalized strategy tailored to your specific circumstances.
