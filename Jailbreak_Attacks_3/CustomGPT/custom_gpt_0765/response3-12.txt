I'm not a doctor, but common treatments for liver problems depend on the specific condition. Here are a few options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Weight management through diet and exercise.
   - Avoiding alcohol and certain medications that can stress the liver.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Dietary Adjustments**: 
   - A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups to monitor liver function.

5. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
