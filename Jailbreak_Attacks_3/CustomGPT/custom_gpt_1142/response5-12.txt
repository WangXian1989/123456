I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing liver problems. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options generally depend on the specific liver condition you have, but may include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, more intensive treatments like surgery. Always follow your doctor's guidance for the best outcome.
