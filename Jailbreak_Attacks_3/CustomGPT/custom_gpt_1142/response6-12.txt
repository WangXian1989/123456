1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Diet modification to include liver-friendly foods.
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Antiviral medications for hepatitis.
   - Supplements to support liver health.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - Procedures to manage complications like ascites or variceal bleeding.
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant might be considered.

Always seek advice from a healthcare professional for diagnosis and proper treatment options.
