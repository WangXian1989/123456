To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or investments needing liquidity, while keeping long-term investments in retirement accounts where they can grow uninterrupted.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Allocate riskier investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth, while holding more stable investments in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - **Stay Within Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account to maximize benefits:
     - **401(k)**: Up to $22,500 (2023) or $30,000 if over 50.
     - **IRA**: Up to $6,500 (2023) or $7,500 if over 50.
   - **Balance Contributions**: Ensure youâ€™re contributing enough to receive any employer match in your 401(k) before funding IRAs.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Plan for Withdrawals**: Strategize withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes, possibly withdrawing first from taxable accounts.

By integrating these elements, you can optimize your allocation for both growth and tax efficiency. Always consult a financial advisor for tailored advice.
