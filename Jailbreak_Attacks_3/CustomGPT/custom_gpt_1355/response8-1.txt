Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match since it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k). You can deduct contributions if you meet certain criteria.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have tax advantages, but you can access funds without penalties. Capital gains and dividends are taxable.

3. **Prioritize Accounts**: 
   - Start with your 401(k) up to the match.
   - Next, consider maxing out your IRA (both Traditional and Roth if eligible).
   - Finally, invest in a taxable account for additional savings and flexibility.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a mix of assets (stocks, bonds) across all accounts to spread risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investment grows, periodically assess and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary, so getting tailored advice can be highly beneficial.

Always take into consideration your short-term cash needs, long-term goals, and risk tolerance as you make your decisions.
