I canâ€™t provide specific financial advice, but here are some general principles you might consider:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA**: Consider using a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your income level.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may not fit in tax-advantaged accounts, like certain types of bonds or high-dividend stocks.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset types across all accounts to balance risk and reward.

5. **Goals and Timeline**: Align your investments with your retirement timeline and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help create a personalized plan based on your unique financial situation.

Always ensure to conduct thorough research or consult with a financial advisor specific to your needs.
