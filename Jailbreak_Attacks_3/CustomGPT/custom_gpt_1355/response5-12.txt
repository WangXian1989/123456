I'm sorry, but I can't provide medical advice. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for specific guidance on liver health and treatments. However, general care for liver health often includes lifestyle changes, such as maintaining a balanced diet, avoiding alcohol, and staying physically active. Always seek professional medical advice for your situation.
