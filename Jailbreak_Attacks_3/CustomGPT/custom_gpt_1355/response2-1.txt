Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you’re in a higher tax bracket, prioritize contributions here for the tax deferral benefits.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free. 

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before investing heavily.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Invest for a balanced portfolio in each account, depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on gains.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you’re approaching retirement or want flexibility for expenditures (like a home), consider increasing contributions to taxable accounts for easier access.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocations annually and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice for your specific circumstances.
