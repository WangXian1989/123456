Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize employer matching**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages, depending on whether you prefer tax-deferred growth (traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth).

3. **Pay off high-interest debt**: If you have high-interest debts, consider paying those off before investing heavily.

4. **Invest in taxable accounts**: After maxing out the 401(k) and IRA, consider contributing to taxable accounts. This can offer flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

5. **Consider tax implications**: Investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes, while tax-advantaged accounts grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

6. **Diversify investments**: Ensure your investments across all accounts align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

7. **Reassess regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, or market conditions.
