Balancing your investments among different account types can be a savvy strategy for optimizing your savings and retirement plans. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match since it's essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if feasible.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to an IRA once you've maximized your 401(k) match. Depending on your income, you can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Diversifying between both can be advantageous.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These can offer more flexibility and access to your funds without penalties. Focus on long-term investments to take advantage of favorable capital gains tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Your investment mix should consider your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. Typically, equities are recommended for long-term growth while fixed income can help stabilize your portfolio.

5. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to align with market changes and your evolving financial situation.

6. **Consult a Professional**: It may also be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor for personalized advice that fits your unique circumstances.

Remember, there's no one-size-fits-all solution, so consider what aligns best with your overall financial plan!
