When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account your financial goals, timeline, and tax implications. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA for tax benefits. 

2. **Assess Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds), and utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Asset Location:** Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, and keep bonds in taxable accounts for better tax treatment.

3. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Ensure regular assessment and adjustment of your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

Evaluating these factors and strategies can lead to a balanced and efficient investment approach. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
