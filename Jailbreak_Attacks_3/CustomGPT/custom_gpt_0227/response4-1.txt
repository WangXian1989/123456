To optimize your investment distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: Place the most tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-yield stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where dividends and interest can grow tax-deferred or tax-free. 

2. **Account Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA up to their limits. This reduces your taxable income and maximizes the benefits of these accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts, considering that your tax-advantaged accounts can hold more aggressive investments.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: When planning for withdrawals, consider the tax implications. You may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Monitor and Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your investments to maintain the desired asset allocation and account for changes in contribution limits, tax laws, or your financial situation.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances.
