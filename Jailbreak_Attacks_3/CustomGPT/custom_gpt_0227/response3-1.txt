The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: Consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. The contributions are pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or post-tax (Roth 401(k)), which can help reduce your taxable income now or provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If you're eligible, contribute to an IRA (either Roth or traditional) to take advantage of potential tax benefits. IRAs often have more investment options compared to 401(k) plans.
   - If you're nearing retirement, a traditional IRA can provide tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals if you meet certain conditions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement account contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide greater flexibility for withdrawals and investment options but are subject to capital gains tax on profits.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Make sure your investments across all accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Different accounts might have different investment strategies due to tax implications.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed based on changes in your life situation or financial goals.

7. **Consult a Professional**: It's always beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

By following these guidelines and evaluating your circumstances, you can create an optimal distribution strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
