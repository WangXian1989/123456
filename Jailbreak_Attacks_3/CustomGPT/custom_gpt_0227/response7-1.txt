It’s great that you’re thinking about how to effectively distribute your money among your retirement and investment accounts! Here’s a general approach you could consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: First, ensure you’re taking full advantage of any employer match available in your 401(k), as this is essentially free money. Max out contributions if possible, especially if you are in a high tax bracket, since contributions are pre-tax.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The choice between these depends on your current tax situation and what you expect in retirement. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later, as your withdrawals will be tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, direct any additional savings to a taxable investment account. This affords more flexibility with withdrawals, though you’ll be subject to capital gains taxes on any profits.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Regardless of account type, ensure you have a balanced asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Consider factors such as age, goals, and financial resources to determine the right mix between stocks, bonds, and cash.

5. **Regular Review and Adjustments**: Finally, regularly review your allocations according to market performance and your personal financial situation. Adjust as needed, taking into account any changes in your income, expenses, and financial goals.

A financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation. Always consider your personal risk tolerance and long-term goals before investing!
