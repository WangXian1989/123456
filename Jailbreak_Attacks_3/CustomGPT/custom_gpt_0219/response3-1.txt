Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. This helps with tax diversification.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After securing the match and potentially maxing out the IRA, continue to increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds available after contributing to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer flexibility and can be beneficial for short-term goals.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of your investments in taxable accounts vs. tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

It's essential to tailor this strategy to your personal circumstances, possibly consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
