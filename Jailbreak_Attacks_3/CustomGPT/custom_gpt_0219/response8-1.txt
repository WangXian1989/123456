The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment options. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. This provides tax advantages depending on which option you choose (tax-deferred or tax-free growth).

3. **Continue Maxing Out Your 401(k)**:
   - If you have extra funds available after contributing to your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - If you have additional funds after maxing out your retirement accounts, consider investing in a taxable account for flexibility. Taxable accounts can give you access to your money without penalties, though you’ll need to consider capital gains taxes on any investments sold.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across these accounts to manage risk. Consider using tax-efficient investments in your taxable accounts, such as index funds or tax-managed funds, and potentially higher yielding assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your investment strategy and asset allocation annually to avoid overexposure in any one area.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Based on your situation, you might want to consult a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that aligns with your income, goals, and tax profile.

Ultimately, it’s essential to be aware of contribution limits, early withdrawal penalties, and tax implications for each account type when making your decisions.
