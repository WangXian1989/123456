Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guide to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if you can afford it, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: If you have the option, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Diversification is key in all types of accounts. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Taxable accounts can be beneficial for investments that generate capital gains (which can be taxed at a lower rate than regular income) or for investments that have favorable tax treatment, like municipal bonds.

4. **Liquid Funds**:
   - Keep a portion of your investments in taxable accounts for liquidity in case you need cash before retirement age.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocation based on market conditions, life changes, and retirement goals.

6. **Professional Advice**:
   - If you're unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.

In essence, aim to maximize your tax-advantaged accounts first while balancing risk and liquidity across all accounts.
