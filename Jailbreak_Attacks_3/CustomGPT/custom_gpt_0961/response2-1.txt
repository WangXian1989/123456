Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan with potential employer match. Contributions are tax-deferred, which can lower your taxable income today.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRA offers tax deductions for contributions, and Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. future tax expectations.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility to withdraw without penalties, but investment gains are taxed. Good for short-term needs or medium-term goals.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially "free money."
   - **IRAs**: If you can, contribute to either a Traditional or Roth IRA where you can benefit from tax advantages.

### 3. **Balance Contributions Based on Goals**
   - **Retirement Focused**: Prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions first. Once maxed out, consider taxable accounts.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth IRA contributions for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - If in a lower bracket now, a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your investment allocations periodically based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **Aggressive Rest of 401(k)**: Maximize contributions up to employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed to either a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA based on tax strategy.
- **Taxable Account**: Any remaining funds can be invested in a taxable account, focusing on investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

### Final Tips
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
- Stay informed about annual contribution limits and tax implications that can change.

These steps will help you create a balanced approach to saving and investing for your future.
