Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** 401(k) contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Tax Benefits:** Both traditional and Roth IRAs offer tax advantages. Choose a traditional IRA if you want immediate tax benefits or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits for IRAs, which may differ based on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, unlike retirement accounts, which may have restrictions.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Consider the tax implications of your investments. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### Suggested Strategy:

- **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions.
- **Consider IRAs**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA up to the maximum limit, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.
- **Fund Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting additional funds into a taxable account for investment growth and liquidity.

### Final Thoughts:

- **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts.
- **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your income, expenses, and goals.
- **Consult a Professional**: If you're uncertain, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

This strategy balances tax efficiency and accessibility to your funds, optimizing your overall investment growth for the future.
