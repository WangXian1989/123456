To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your current taxable income. Ideal for higher-income years.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for short-term goals or emergency funds, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your time horizon for each account. Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth and stock investments. Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments.
  
3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Assess your comfort with risk. Higher risk assets can be allocated to long-term accounts, while conservative investments may be better suited for taxable accounts.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. Max out employer match in your 401(k) first, then consider IRAs.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Within each account, ensure a diversified investment strategy across asset classes that matches your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consider Professional Advice**:
   - Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your individual situation and goals.

In summary, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings, while using taxable accounts for more immediate needs and liquidity. Regularly reassess your strategy to adapt to any changes in your financial situation or goals.
