Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering various factors including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to optimize your distribution:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax considerations. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
  
2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Evaluate your current tax bracket to determine whether to prioritize tax-deferred accounts or after-tax contributions.
   - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts to lessen the impact of taxes, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower turnover and capital gains distributions.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Maintain a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all account types to balance risk and return tailored to your risk tolerance and timeline.
   - Ensure that allocation strategies align with your retirement timeline, rebalancing as necessary.

4. **Prioritize Savings Goals:**
   - Allocate funds based on short-term versus long-term goals; for instance, maintain liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs while keeping long-term investments in retirement accounts.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Schedule annual reviews of your investment strategy to adapt to changes in income, expenses, and changes in tax law.

It is essential to tailor the distribution strategy to your unique financial situation and goals, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
