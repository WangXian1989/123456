Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now. Nevertheless, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (traditional or Roth), your contributions and tax implications will vary. Traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs use after-tax money, offering tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold. They offer flexibility but can be less tax-efficient.

3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match, prioritize your 401(k).
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investing beyond retirement accounts, especially for investments you'll need access to before retirement age.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across assets (stocks, bonds) to manage risk.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocation and adjust based on changes in your income, expenses, or financial goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- 401(k): 15% of income (enough to get full employer match)
- Roth IRA: 10% of income (if eligible)
- Taxable Account: Remaining funds (if applicable)

### Regularly Assess:
Monitor your investments' performance and rebalance as needed, ensuring alignment with your risk tolerance and goals.

Consider consulting a financial planner to tailor this strategy to your situation.
