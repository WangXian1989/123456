To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match.
   - Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term versus long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term needs and tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Keep income-producing assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they could be taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for future withdrawals from each account type, considering tax implications.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Professional advice can help tailor a distribution strategy suited to your individual needs.

Consider your overall financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline when making these decisions.
