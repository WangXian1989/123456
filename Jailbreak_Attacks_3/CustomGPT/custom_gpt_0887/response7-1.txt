The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If youâ€™re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, which can be advantageous if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.

### 3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**
   - After maximizing the employer match and IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - If you have additional funds, consider a taxable brokerage account. This offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from different accounts. For example, 401(k) and Traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while withdrawals from a Roth IRA are typically tax-free if certain conditions are met.

### 6. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to balance risk and return appropriately.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific circumstances.

By strategically distributing your contributions among these accounts, you can optimize your tax situation, investment growth, and retirement readiness.
