Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline to help you formulate a strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—usually up to 3-6% of your salary.
   - **Advantage:** This is essentially “free money” that boosts your retirement savings.

### 2. **Consider IRA Contributions**
   - **Type:** Depending on your eligibility, consider a Traditional or Roth IRA.
   - **Limitations:** For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **Tax Impact:** Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Further Fund the 401(k)**
   - **Continue Contributions:** After maximizing the match, increase your 401(k) contributions if you can.
   - **Tax Deferral:** Contributions reduce your taxable income and grow tax-deferred.

### 4. **Assess Taxable Accounts**
   - **Supplementary Savings:** Use taxable accounts for additional savings, especially for goals nearing fruition (less than 5 years).
   - **Investment Choices:** Utilize a diversified investment strategy to manage capital gains and dividends effectively.

### 5. **Balance for Liquidity**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure that you have emergency savings outside of these accounts (3-6 months’ worth of expenses).
   - **Accessibility:** Taxable accounts provide more liquidity than retirement accounts.

### 6. **Review Your Investment Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - **Rebalancing:** Periodically review and rebalance your investment portfolio to maintain target asset allocation.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - **Customized Advice:** A professional can give tailored advice based on your specific circumstances and financial goals.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach typically includes maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, ensuring liquidity through a taxable account, and aligning investments with your risk tolerance and financial objectives. Regularly revisit your strategy to adapt to life's changes.
