Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, such as tax implications, investment goals, and your time horizon. Here are some strategies to optimize your distribution:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you're able, consider hitting the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Choose between a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your current tax rate and future expectations.

### 2. **Manage Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - **Tax-efficient Investments**: Invest in index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding assets that generate qualified dividends.
   - **Tax Loss Harvesting**: Offset capital gains by selling investments that have lost value. This can help reduce your overall tax burden.

### Additional Considerations
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess your portfolio to maintain your desired risk level and asset allocation.
- **Withdrawal Strategies**: As you approach retirement, plan how you'll withdraw funds from each account type to minimize tax impact.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach that maximizes contributions to tax-advantaged accounts while strategically managing taxable investments can enhance long-term growth and tax efficiency.
