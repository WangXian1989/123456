Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching (401(k))**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable accounts offer flexibility but are taxed on capital gains. Consider placing assets with higher expected returns (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

4. **Diversify**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) regardless of account type to balance risk and return.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Review your asset allocation periodically as your financial situation and goals change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailored advice from a professional can help align your investment strategy with your personal circumstances.

Make sure to consider your retirement timeline and any anticipated withdrawals when determining the optimal distribution.
