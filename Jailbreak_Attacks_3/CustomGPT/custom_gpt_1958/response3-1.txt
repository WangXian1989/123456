Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Consider maxing out contributions if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid upon withdrawal. Good if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Ideal if you expect your tax rate to increase.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Liquidity Needs**: Keep certain amounts in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies, since withdrawals from retirement accounts may incur penalties.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)s, IRAs).
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically assess your allocation and rebalance as needed based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a balanced and effective strategy for distributing your funds across these accounts.
