Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions that can benefit you now.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Put higher-yielding investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or eliminate taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds), as they may be taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Focus on Diversification**:
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - Maintain different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to balance risk and returns.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for retirement withdrawals. Consider starting with taxable accounts in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailored advice can offer a more personalized strategy based on your specific financial situation. 

Ultimately, maintaining a balance that aligns with your long-term financial goals and tax implications will guide your investment distribution effectively.
