Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some steps and considerations to help you determine the best distribution strategy:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: 
   - 401(k) plans have annual contribution limits. For 2023, the limit is typically $22,500, with an additional catch-up contribution for those aged 50 or older.
   - IRA contributions are limited to $6,500, with a catch-up of $1,000 for those 50 and older.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Generally, itâ€™s advisable to max out tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA before contributing to taxable accounts. Contributions to these accounts can reduce your taxable income and allow your investments to grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

3. **Consider Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a match on 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts. This is essentially free money and benefits your overall savings strategy.

4. **Evaluate Investment Options**:
   - Assess the investment choices available in each account. If your 401(k) has high fees or limited options, you may want to maximize contributions to your IRA if it offers better investment opportunities.

5. **Balance Growth and Risk**:
   - Think about your risk tolerance and investment time horizon. Younger investors may opt for more aggressive investments in growth accounts, while those closer to retirement may shift toward safer, income-generating investments.

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Understand the tax implications of withdrawals. Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free. Taxable accounts have capital gains taxes on profits.

7. **Retirement Age Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals based on your retirement age. You may want to draw from taxable accounts first during the early years of retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

8. **Rebalance as Needed**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investment portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and adjust based on life changes or shifts in financial goals.
