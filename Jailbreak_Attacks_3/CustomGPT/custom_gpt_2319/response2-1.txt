The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, current situation, and the rules governing each account type. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially free money. After that, consider maximizing your contributions up to the annual limit if financially feasible.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. 

2. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have an emergency fund that covers three to six months of living expenses before investing heavily. This should be held in a taxable account or savings account for easy access.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is especially important for goals that are shorter-term or if you may need access to funds before retirement age, as withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties and taxes.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Distributing your contributions should factor in your current and expected future tax brackets. It may be advantageous to invest more in tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds) and to favor tax-deferred growth in retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Keep your investment strategy diversified based on your risk tolerance. You may choose to have different asset allocations in each account type. For example, holding more aggressive assets in tax-advantaged accounts can be beneficial, as these grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

6. **Check Contribution Limits and Eligibility**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type and ensure you are eligible for the types of accounts and contributions you want to make.

7. **Continuous Review and Rebalancing**: Regularly review your investment allocation and rebalance as needed based on market performance and any changes in your financial goals or risk tolerance.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor who can offer personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
