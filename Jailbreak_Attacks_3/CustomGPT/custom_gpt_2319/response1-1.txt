Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), ensure you’re contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (like 401(k) and traditional IRA): Contributions lower your taxable income, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts** (like a Roth IRA): Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider contributing here if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While these don't offer tax advantages like retirement accounts, they offer more flexibility with withdrawals. You only pay taxes on any realized gains and dividends.

3. **Investment Goals & Timeframe**:
   - If you’re young and have decades until retirement, you might prioritize investing in equities with higher growth potential in your tax-advantaged accounts.
   - If you’re closer to retirement, consider a more conservative allocation, focusing on safe investments like bonds, particularly in tax-deferred accounts to minimize taxable income in your working years.

4. **Diversification**: Balance your portfolio to spread risk. You might invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets, adjusting based on the type of account (for instance, more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts).

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your asset allocation and reallocate as necessary to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: It’s often beneficial to get personalized guidance based on your specific situation.

It's essential to consider your individual circumstances, including your current tax bracket, expected future income, and retirement goals when deciding how to allocate funds.
