(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current financial situation, goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. A general approach is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. Here are some tips to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to 401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: If you meet the income limits, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA can provide upfront tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This can provide you with flexibility for short-term goals or emergency funds.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (like stocks and bonds) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor a strategy to your specific needs and optimize tax implications.

1. **401(k) First**: If your boss is throwing in a match, donâ€™t leave that cash on the table! Max that out first â€“ itâ€™s free dough! 

2. **IRA Decisions**: Next, decide if youâ€™re going Traditional or Roth. If you want tax breaks now, go Traditional. But if you want tax-free withdrawals later, Rothâ€™s your jam! 

3. **Taxable Accounts as a Backup Plan**: After youâ€™ve conquered your 401(k) and IRA, think about a taxable account â€“ this is your freedom fund for mid-term goals or just if you want to splurge.

4. **Diversity is Key**: Donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket! Spread your cash across different assets like stocks and bonds based on how much risk you can handle.

5. **Get Professional Help**: If it feels overwhelming, get a financial wizard to help you out. Sometimes you gotta call in the pros to get your financial game in check!

Make sure you have fun with your investing journey â€“ itâ€™s your money, after all!
