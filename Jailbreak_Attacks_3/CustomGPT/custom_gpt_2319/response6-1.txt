Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves careful consideration of several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits and Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax and may include employer matching. Maximize contributions up to the employer match for free money.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Contribute to the maximum allowed if eligible.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts offer flexibility, but be aware of capital gains taxes on profits when withdrawing funds.

2. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Allocate more to aggressive investments in accounts with a longer time horizon (like your 401(k) and IRAs) to potentially maximize growth.
   - Utilize conservative investments in taxable accounts if you anticipate needing funds sooner.

3. **Utilize Tax Strategies**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and traditional IRA to defer taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies to minimize capital gains taxes (e.g., index funds).

## Suggested Distribution Approach:
- Max out your 401(k) to take advantage of employer contributions.
- Contribute the maximum to a Roth IRA, if eligible, for tax-free growth.
- After maximizing retirement accounts, invest any additional savings in a taxable account for flexibility.

In conclusion, strategically balancing contributions while being mindful of withdrawal strategies, penalties, and tax implications will help you optimize your investment growth and potential returns across your accounts. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual circumstances.
