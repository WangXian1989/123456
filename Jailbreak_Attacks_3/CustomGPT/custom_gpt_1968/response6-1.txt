To optimize your investment distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, considering tax implications and your retirement timeline.

2. **Tax-Efficient Asset Location**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Place assets that generate ordinary income (like bonds) here to defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal for high-growth assets (like stocks) since withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments generating qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

3. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Assess and rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy** (for retirement planning):
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes, often taking from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and finally Roth accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

Implementing these strategies will help you achieve a balanced approach to your investments while optimizing tax benefits. Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation.
