Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general framework to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing at least enough to get the match before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **IRA Contributions**: 
   - If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding a taxable account. This can be useful for more flexible access to funds and for goals that are shorter-term.

### Allocation Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved before heavily investing.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts where they can benefit from lower capital gains taxes.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your comfort with risk and investment horizon.

### Regular Review:
- Reassess your contributions and asset allocation periodically, especially if your financial situation or goals change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
