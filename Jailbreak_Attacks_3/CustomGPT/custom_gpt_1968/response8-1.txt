To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the 401(k) up to the maximum your employer matches. Consider maximizing contributions to this account if your employer offers a match (typically up to 6% to 10% of your salary).
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that may be subject to lower long-term capital gains rates or for investments you may want to access before retirement without penalties. This could include index funds, ETFs, or individual stocks.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider keeping high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax benefits.
   - Place more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they may generate interest income taxed at ordinary income rates.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation, factoring in tax implications.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about your withdrawal strategy for retirement—typically, you’d want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like IRAs), and lastly, tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to minimize tax liabilities.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If your situation is complex or you’re unsure about the best approach, consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can be beneficial.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.
