I'm sorry to hear you're having liver issues. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options may vary depending on the specific liver problem, but here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet: A healthy diet low in fat, sugar, and processed foods helps support liver health.
   - Exercise: Regular physical activity can improve overall health and assist in weight management.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), specific medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular follow-ups with blood tests and imaging may be necessary to track liver function and any progression of disease.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is vital for liver health.

5. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol can improve liver health.

6. **Advanced Treatments**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be considered, especially for end-stage liver disease.

Always work closely with your healthcare team to determine the best course of action tailored to your specific situation.
