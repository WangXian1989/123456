To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (usually a key benefit).
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals), depending on your tax situation.
  
2. **Assess Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a Roth IRA might be beneficial since you'll pay taxes on contributions now and not on withdrawals later.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) may be more advantageous.

3. **Balance Contributions:**
   - After maximizing employer match in the 401(k), balance contributions between the IRA and additional 401(k) contributions based on your retirement timeline and financial goals.

4. **Consider Investment Options:**
   - Assess the investment options available in your 401(k) compared to your IRAs and taxable accounts. If your 401(k) has limited options or high fees, it might be better to focus on IRAs.

5. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term savings or investments that generate capital gains or dividends, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

6. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Ensure that your overall investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts, diversifying your investments accordingly.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can help tailor your approach based on your specific financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.
