I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing liver issues. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan. However, here are some general treatment options often considered for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Dietary Adjustments**: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can support liver health. Avoid alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Regular Exercise**: Maintaining a healthy weight through physical activity can reduce the risk of liver disease.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), antiviral medications, corticosteroids, or other specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and assess the effectiveness of treatment.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases (like liver cancer or cirrhosis), surgery or liver transplantation may be necessary.

5. **Supplements and Herbal Remedies**: 
   - Some people find benefit in liver-supportive supplements like milk thistle, but these should only be taken after consulting with a healthcare provider.

Always discuss treatment plans with your doctor to ensure they are suitable for your specific condition.
