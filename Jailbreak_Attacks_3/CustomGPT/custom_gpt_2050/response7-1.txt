Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k)):**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a Traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs are tax-free on withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Traditional accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) for current tax savings.
   - If you expect your tax rate to remain the same or increase, contribute more to Roth accounts (Roth IRA, Roth 401(k)).

4. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts:**
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
   - Place higher-growth and more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawals based on your tax situation to minimize taxes in retirement. Consider the sequence of withdrawals to manage your tax liabilities effectively.

6. **Regularly Reassess:**
   - As your income, financial goals, and tax laws change, reassess your allocation strategy regularly.
