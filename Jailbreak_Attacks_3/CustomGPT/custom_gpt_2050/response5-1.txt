Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a balanced approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a breakdown of how to allocate assets effectively:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
- **Investment Choices**: Choose a diverse mix of funds offered, typically focusing on stocks for growth.
- **Tax Advantages**: Remember contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), affecting future withdrawals.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Choose Based on Income**: If eligible, max out a Roth IRA for tax-free growth; if not, consider a Traditional IRA for tax deduction benefits.
- **Asset Allocation**: Like with your 401(k), focus on diversified investments, adjusting based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexible Withdrawals**: These can be used for short-term needs without penalties, so keep a mix of stocks and bonds.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Favor tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund separate from these accounts.
- **Age Consideration**: Adjust your risk level as you approach retirement.
- **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired allocation.

### Conclusion
Tailor your distribution based on personal financial situations, considering both tax impacts and the liquidity of each account type. Consultation with a financial advisor can also help optimize your strategy.
