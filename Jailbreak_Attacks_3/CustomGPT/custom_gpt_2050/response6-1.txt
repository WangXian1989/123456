To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Otherwise, a traditional IRA can offer tax deductions.

### 2. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - **Invest for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments that may require liquidity, such as emergency funds or major purchases.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider holding index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes, as they typically generate fewer taxable events.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Allocate more funds to tax-advantaged accounts if you're in a higher tax bracket to minimize immediate tax liability.
   - In lower tax brackets, taxable accounts might provide more flexibility without as much tax burden.

### 4. **Focus on Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Typically beneficial to hold higher-growth investments (stocks) due to tax-deferred growth, optimizing for long-term returns.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Healthy mix of bonds and equities can balance returns and tax implications.

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to 401(k) and IRA accounts first, then allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts.
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing financial goals and tax situations.
