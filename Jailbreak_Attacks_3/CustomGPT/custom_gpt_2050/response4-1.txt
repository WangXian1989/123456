Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this first for tax-deferred growth, especially if your employer matches contributions. In 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older). A Roth IRA may provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can offer flexibility and liquidity. They are subject to capital gains taxes, but they can provide strategic tax benefits like tax-loss harvesting.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account type based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally:
   - *401(k)*: Higher growth assets if you’re far from retirement.
   - *IRA*: Consider a mix of stocks and bonds, adjusting as you approach retirement.
   - *Taxable Accounts*: Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Ideally, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts to optimize tax efficiency.
