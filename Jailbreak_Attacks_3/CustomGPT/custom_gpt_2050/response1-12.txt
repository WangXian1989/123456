I'm not a doctor, but if you suspect liver issues, it's critical to consult a healthcare professional. Treatment generally depends on the specific condition affecting your liver. Common approaches might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, increasing exercise, and reducing alcohol intake.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the issue, medications may help manage symptoms or treat the underlying condition.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy may be needed.
5. **Transplantation**: For advanced liver disease, a transplant may be the only option.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for diagnosis and personalized treatment.
