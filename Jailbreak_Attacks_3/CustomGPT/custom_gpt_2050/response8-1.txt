Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, which is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and are good for short-to-medium-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider the type of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance. Generally, higher risk assets can be placed in longer-term accounts like IRAs, while more stable investments may be suited for taxable accounts.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-yield stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation as markets fluctuate.

7. **Consider Withdrawals**: Plan for future withdrawals. Distributions from 401(k) and Traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while long-term capital gains from taxable accounts may have lower tax rates.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.
