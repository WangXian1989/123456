To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs for long-term growth to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less income or have favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains).

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out employer-matching contributions in your 401(k) first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - After that, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Investment Growth**:
   - Place assets with high growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where you won't face taxes until withdrawal.
   - Keep more income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications more effectively.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for how and when you'll withdraw funds. Consider tax implications based on your retirement income strategy and whether you expect to be in a higher or lower tax bracket.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Regular Reassessment**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations regularly based on performance and your changing financial goals.

Overall, the right distribution will depend on your specific financial situation, goals, risk tolerance, and tax brackets, so it might also help to consult with a financial advisor.
