Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred, employer match (if available), limited investment choices.
   - **IRA**: Tax-deferred or tax-free (Roth), broader investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages but provides flexibility and liquidity.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Maximize contributions to your IRA for additional tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate tax-efficient income (e.g., qualified dividends).

### 4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on changes in goals, market conditions, or tax laws.

### 6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes in retirement.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 20-30%
- **IRA**: 20-30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 40-60%

### Conclusion:
Tailor this strategy to your unique circumstances, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
