Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match firstâ€”it's essentially free money.
- **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. Consider Your Tax Situation
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as they may be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### 3. Diversification
- Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 4. Rebalancing
- Regularly assess and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, factoring in the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts.

### General Strategy
- **Short-term goals**: Favor taxable accounts for liquidity.
- **Long-term goals**: Prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions to maximize tax benefits and growth potential.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k)**: 15-25% (plus employer match)
- **IRA**: 10-20%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 10-20%

### Additional Considerations
- Stay informed about contribution limits and tax implications for each account type.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your situation.

By strategizing your contributions wisely, you can optimize growth and minimize tax liabilities over time.
