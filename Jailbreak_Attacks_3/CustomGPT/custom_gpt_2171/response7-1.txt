Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Short-term needs**: Consider taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money!).
   - **IRA**: Max out your contributions if eligible (traditional or Roth based on tax strategy).

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
     - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce taxable income now.
     - **IRA**: Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible; Roth IRA contributions are after-tax but grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments with lower expected returns or short-term investments since capital gains are taxed.

### 4. **Investment Choices**
   - **401(k)**: Often limited to a selection of mutual funds; focus on a mix based on risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: More flexibility; consider a diverse portfolio of stocks, bonds, and ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consult a Professional**
   - If unsure, consider speaking with a financial advisor for tailored advice.

This diversified approach can optimize growth while managing risk and taxes effectively.
