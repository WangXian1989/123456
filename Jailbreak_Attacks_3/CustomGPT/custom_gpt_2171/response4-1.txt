Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

### 1. **Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Taxes are paid on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes upon sale and income taxes on dividends and interest.

### 2. **Investment Goals:**
   - Consider your short-term versus long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term needs due to liquidity, while dedicating tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings.

### 3. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for each account type. For instance, in 2023, the 401(k) has a limit of $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50), while IRAs have a limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Generally, place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes, and consider placing bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to utilize the lower capital gains tax rates.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for when and how you'll access these funds. Retirement accounts are for long-term growth, while taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals.

### Suggested Approach:
- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** If your employer matches contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.
- **Fully Fund IRA:** If eligible, contribute to an IRA, prioritizing Roth if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
- **Next, Allocate to Taxable Accounts:** Use any remaining funds for taxable investing, focusing on investments that you're likely to hold long-term to minimize taxes.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach tailored to your financial situation, goals, and tax bracket is key. Consider periodic reviews and adjustments as your circumstances change. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice.
