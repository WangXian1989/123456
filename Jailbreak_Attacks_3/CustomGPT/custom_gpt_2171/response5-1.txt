(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages:** Focus on tax-deferred accounts first (like your 401(k) and IRA) to reduce your taxable income in the present. 

3. **Consider Income Needs:** If you expect to need the money in the short term, prioritize taxable accounts for easier access.

4. **Rebalance Periodically:** Use a strategic approach by reviewing and adjusting your allocations as your financial situation changes over time.

1. **First Up, Grab That Match!** If your 401(k) has that employer match, put in enough to get that juicy bonus. Itâ€™s free cash, so donâ€™t leave it on the table!

2. **Tax Shelters Are Your Friend:** Pour your dough into the 401(k) and IRA. They let you dodge Uncle Sam for a while, and who doesnâ€™t want that? Itâ€™s all about long-term gains, baby!

3. **Need Cash Flow? Taxable's the Way:** If you think you might need some funds soon â€” like for a fancy trip or a car â€” then stash some cash in taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re way easier to access.

4. **Reassess Like a Boss:** Donâ€™t just set it and forget it! Check back in regularly to tweak your allocations based on whatâ€™s happening with your finances. Keep that money working for you! 

Make it work for you, and youâ€™ll be rolling in cash like a pro!
