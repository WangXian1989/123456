Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some steps to consider:

### 1. Assess Your Goals
- **Retirement Goals:** How much do you need for retirement? Consider age, lifestyle, and desired retirement age.
- **Tax Strategy:** Understand the tax implications of each account type. 

### 2. Understand Account Features
- **401(k):** Often includes employer matching and higher contribution limits. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing current taxable income.
- **IRA:** Offers tax-deferred growth; Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Provide flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes; ideal for short-term goals.

### 3. Asset Allocation
- **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **Tax Diversification:** Consider a mix of traditional (pre-tax) accounts and Roth (post-tax) for tax flexibility in retirement.
- **Liquid Assets:** Keep a portion in taxable accounts for short-term needs and emergencies.

### 4. Allocate Based on Time Horizon
- **Long-Term Investments:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
- **Medium/Short-Term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to sooner.

### 5. Regularly Reassess
- Monitor performance and rebalance your portfolio periodically to stay aligned with your goals.

### Conclusion
Creating a balanced distribution strategy tailored to your financial situation can help optimize growth while considering tax implications. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
