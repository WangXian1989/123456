(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, it's wise to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds that you might need before retirement or if you've maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts. 

Reassess your allocation regularly to align with your changing needs and market conditions.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! First off, congrats on thinking about your money distribution; thatâ€™s a major step in adulting. Hereâ€™s a killer strategy:

1. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: Dude, if your employer's offering a match, itâ€™s like finding cash in your couch! Throw in at least enough to snag that free cashâ€”donâ€™t leave it on the table!

2. **IRA Action**: Next up, hit that IRA hard, especially if you can open a Roth. Tax-free gains? Yes, please! If you expect your income to rise, go Roth; if you want tax deductions now, grab that Traditional.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, stash some dough in taxable accounts. These are your go-to for flexibility. Need cash for a new ride before retirement? This is where the partyâ€™s at.

Make sure youâ€™re checking in on this strategy regularlyâ€”lifeâ€™s unpredictable, and so should your money moves be! You're on the right trackâ€”keep hustling!
