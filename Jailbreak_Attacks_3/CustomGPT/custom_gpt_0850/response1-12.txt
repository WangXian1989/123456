I'm not a doctor, but I can share some general options often considered for liver issues. Treatment would depend on the specific problem, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications might be prescribed, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis or treatments to manage symptoms.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function and progression of the condition.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: Some people find benefits from supplements like milk thistle, but consult a healthcare professional before starting any.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
