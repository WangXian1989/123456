To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If youâ€™re eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Balance Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Prioritize tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs for higher-income investments (like bonds) to minimize tax burdens.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds) and for money you may need before retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you have a diversified mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Adjust for Retirement Needs**: As you approach retirement, gradually shift towards more stable, lower-risk investments to protect your capital.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
