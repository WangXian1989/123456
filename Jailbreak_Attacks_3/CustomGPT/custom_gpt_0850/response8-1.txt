To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially "free" money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the maximum limit if possible, especially if you receive an employer match. Traditional 401(k) contributions lower your taxable income in the year they're made.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A traditional IRA can provide tax-deductible contributions, whereas Roth IRA contributions grow tax-free.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are more suited for after-tax investments. Use them for investments that may generate higher taxes, like bonds or actively managed funds, because they are subject to capital gains tax upon sale.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified in terms of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk.

5. **Retirement Timeline**: Your investment strategy can change based on your retirement timeline. If retirement is several decades away, you may want a more aggressive investment approach in your 401(k) and IRA. As you approach retirement, gradually shift to more conservative investments.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when to withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and traditional IRA should be tapped into last to allow them to continue growing tax-deferred.

7. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review your investment allocations and contributions based on changes in your financial situation and goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs and risk tolerance.
