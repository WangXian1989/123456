Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Limitations:** Consider maximum contribution limits and any vesting schedules.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Types of IRAs:** If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits and past contribution options if you're eligible.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Use these accounts for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing funds before retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxable events.

### General Guidelines
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have enough liquid savings for emergencies before heavily investing.
- **Asset Allocation:** Diversify across asset classes based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Rebalancing:** Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your goals.

### Strategy Overview
1. Max out employer 401(k) match.
2. Contribute to an IRA (consider Roth vs. Traditional based on your tax situation).
3. Fund a taxable account if you have additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.
