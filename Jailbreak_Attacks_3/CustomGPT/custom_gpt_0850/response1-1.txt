Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Max out contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) after your 401(k) match. IRAs often provide tax advantages, so prioritize these accounts.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you can still contribute beyond the match and have maxed out your IRA, consider contributing more to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need in the short-term or for investments that could benefit from favorable capital gains treatment (like long-term investments).

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider professional advice tailored to your specific situation, especially regarding tax implications and retirement goals.

Always evaluate the specifics of your financial situation when deciding how to allocate funds.
