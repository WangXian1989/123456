To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Contribution Limits**: Understand the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) (or $30,000 if you're over 50) and $6,500 to an IRA (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

2. **Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Match contributions from your employer should be prioritized since they are free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions might be tax-deductible or tax-free upon withdrawal. Choose based on your current tax bracket and retirement expectations.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes. Use these for investments that donâ€™t produce high yields, like bonds or certain funds that may generate taxable income.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider high-growth assets in your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-managed funds.
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, plan on how you'll withdraw from each account to minimize taxes. Typically, it might make sense to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s, and finally tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. This will help you respond to market fluctuations and shifting financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If in doubt, working with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation and goals.

This approach will help you maximize growth while minimizing tax liabilities in your investment strategy over time.
