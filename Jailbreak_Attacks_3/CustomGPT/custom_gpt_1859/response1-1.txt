Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**:
   - Before fully funding retirement accounts, make sure to pay down high-interest debt (like credit cards). The interest you save is often greater than potential investment returns.

3. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**:
   - If you’re younger and have a long time before retirement, you can lean more heavily towards equities in your tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter horizons, consider balancing your risk.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. Consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds) and sectors. This is critical for risk management.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - As markets fluctuate, your asset allocation may drift from your original plan. Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you’re unsure about the best approach for your situation, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your goals and risk tolerance.

By balancing contributions to each account type based on these considerations, you can optimize growth and prepare for a secure financial future.
