Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), consider contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great return on investment.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income level and filing status, contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA can provide valuable tax benefits. With a traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, and with a Roth IRA, your withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After securing the employer match and IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit. The 401(k) offers tax-deferred growth, which is beneficial as your savings compound over time.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have utilized tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable brokerage accounts. They allow for more flexibility in withdrawals and investments, though they don't offer the same tax advantages as retirement accounts. These can be useful if you plan to access funds before retirement age.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, consider a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals. Balance stocks, bonds, and other assets accordingly.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Keep tax implications in mind when deciding what to invest in each account. For example, bonds or funds that generate regular income might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high taxes on interest income.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your strategy and adjust contributions as needed. Life changes, such as changes in income, family size, or retirement goals, might necessitate a shift in your distribution approach.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
