To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Often includes employer matching contributions and offers tax-deferred growth. Prioritize maxing out contributions, especially to get any match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: IRAs provide tax advantages but have different rules. A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions upfront. Choose based on your current vs. anticipated future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are flexible and can provide liquidity but are subject to capital gains tax. Theyâ€™re useful for savings goals outside of retirement.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Start with your 401(k) and contribute enough to receive the full employer match.
   - Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. For 2024, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). 

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize pre-tax contributions (like 401(k) or Traditional IRA) to lower your taxable income.
   - If you expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement, consider maximizing your Roth IRA contributions.

4. **Investment Choices**:
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA) to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Place bonds and other income-generating assets in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities since interest income is taxed at ordinary income rates.

5. **Emergency Fund vs. Investments**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund separate from these accounts before aggressively investing.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Annually reevaluate your strategy based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals and adjust contributions accordingly.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

This balanced approach helps optimize your investments for growth while minimizing tax implications.
