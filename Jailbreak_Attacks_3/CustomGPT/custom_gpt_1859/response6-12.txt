1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or improve liver function.
   - For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications are common.
   - Corticosteroids may be used for autoimmune liver diseases.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopt dietary adjustments and avoid alcohol.
   - A balanced diet low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables can support liver health.
   - Regular exercise helps maintain a healthy weight, reducing strain on the liver.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Checkups**: Regular medical checkups and blood tests are crucial to monitor liver function and adjust treatment as needed.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options like a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some consider herbal remedies, though these should be discussed with a doctor to avoid interactions.

Always seek specialized guidance based on your specific condition and needs.
