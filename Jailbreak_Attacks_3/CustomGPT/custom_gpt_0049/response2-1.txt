The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Consider a traditional 401(k) if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), you can choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). Assess your current vs. future tax situations when deciding.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are important for flexibility and liquidity. Consider investing in tax-efficient vehicles (like index funds and ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing. Generally, it’s advisable to have 3-6 months’ worth of expenses set aside.

4. **Diversification**: Regardless of account type, aim for a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives. This typically includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors may prioritize growth in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) with a more aggressive asset allocation. As you near retirement, shift toward more conservative investments, balancing with taxable accounts for liquidity.

6. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for each account type and adjust your strategy accordingly each year.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Certain accounts may be better to draw from first based on tax implications.

8. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of individual circumstances, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

Always review your portfolio regularly and adjust your contributions based on performance, changes in income, and life events.
