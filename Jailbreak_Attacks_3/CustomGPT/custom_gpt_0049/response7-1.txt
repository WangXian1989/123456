The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Contribute enough to reach the match, then assess your overall savings.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After taking full advantage of your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions. Choose based on your current tax bracket and expected retirement bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you still have funds remaining after maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility, but you will owe taxes on capital gains and dividends.

**Tips for Distribution**:
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start with the accounts offering tax advantages, as they allow your investments to grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
- **Consider Your Investment Horizon**: If you have a long time until retirement, consider a higher allocation to stocks in your 401(k) and IRAs, while being more conservative in taxable accounts due to higher tax implications.
- **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) and sectors to manage risk.

Lastly, it's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor an investment strategy specific to your individual circumstances.
