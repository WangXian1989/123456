The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Since contributions are often pre-tax (or Roth contributions post-tax), this can help reduce your taxable income now or grow tax-free.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax bracket.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Make sure to contribute up to the annual limit for IRAs, especially if you are self-employed or have variable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them good for short-term goals or as an emergency fund.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on holding investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, which tend to have lower capital gains distributions compared to actively managed funds.

**General Allocation Strategy**:
- Assess your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- Diversify your investments within each account type. For example, in your 401(k) and IRA, consider a mix of stocks (for growth) and bonds (for stability). 
- Maintain an emergency fund in your taxable account to cover unexpected expenses.

**Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations to ensure they meet your evolving financial goals and market conditions. 

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation!
