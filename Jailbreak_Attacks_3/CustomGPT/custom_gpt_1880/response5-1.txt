Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach to maximize tax benefits and investment growth. Here are some tips:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first. These accounts often have tax benefits that can help increase your savings over time. If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For instance, 401(k) contributions have higher limits than IRAs. Prioritize funding your 401(k) until you reach the limit, then focus on your IRA.

3. **Investment Strategy:** Consider your investment options and time horizon for each account type. Long-term investments, such as stocks, might be better suited to the tax-advantaged accounts due to deferred taxes. In taxable accounts, consider holding more tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts before making large investments. This helps maintain financial stability without needing to withdraw from retirement accounts prematurely.

5. **Diversification:** Diversify your investments across all accounts. Each account can hold different types of investments that align with your overall financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Review Annually:** Regularly review your allocation and adjust as necessary based on changes in income, expenses, and investment performance.

By leveraging these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money across these accounts to maximize your savings and investment growth.
