Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then consider maximizing your IRA contributions, as both 401(k)s and IRAs offer tax benefits.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxable. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize these accounts. For taxable accounts, you may want to focus on holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you have enough liquidity in your taxable accounts for emergencies and short-term needs. This way, you wonâ€™t have to tap into your retirement accounts prematurely.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This helps manage risk and can lead to better overall returns. Each account type can hold a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your investment allocations. Different accounts may grow at different rates, so ensure each account aligns with your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, plan your withdrawal strategy. Typically, it can be wise to draw from taxable accounts first for a few years to avoid increasing your taxable income too early.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation, helping you decide the best way to allocate your funds. 

By considering these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to managing your investments across these accounts.
