A well-thought-out investment strategy will depend on several factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines for distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
  
2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Good for higher-income earners looking for tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: A traditional IRA offers similar tax benefits as a 401(k). A Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and withdrawals, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lesser tax burdens, such as long-term capital gains or municipal bonds.

3. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund set up before heavily investing in these accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Balance your risk by diversifying investments among various asset classes like stocks, bonds, and real estate across all accounts.

5. **Retirement Focus**:
   - Prioritize retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth due to tax advantages, but utilize taxable accounts as a supplemental strategy for liquidity.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to customize your asset allocation based on your specific financial situation and retirement goals.
