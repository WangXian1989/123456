When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s important to think about your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some general considerations:

1. **401(k):**  
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now, but you will pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**  
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals during retirement will be taxed. 
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider maximizing your Roth contributions.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**  
   - Use these for investments you may need to access before retirement age or for long-term goals (like buying a home).
   - Capital gains tax can apply when you sell investments, so consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

**Strategy for Distribution:**  
- Start by maximizing your employer's 401(k) match.
- Next, contribute to an IRA based on your tax situation (Roth or Traditional).
- After those contributions, you can put any additional funds into your taxable accounts, focusing on investments that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

Ultimately, working with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your individual circumstances is advisable. This personalized approach ensures that you're making the most of each account type according to your financial goals.
