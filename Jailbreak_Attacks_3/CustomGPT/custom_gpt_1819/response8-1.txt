To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Accounts:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this match, as it is essentially free money. Aim to contribute at least enough to meet this threshold before allocating further funds elsewhere.

2. **IRA Contributions:** Consider maxing out your contributions to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals) after meeting your employer's match. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can put additional funds into a taxable investment account. This allows for flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices, although you may have to pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Investment Options:** Diversify your investments within each account type based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and overall financial goals. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Retirement Timeline:** If you are closer to retirement, shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital. Conversely, if you have a longer time horizon, you may want to be more aggressive with your investments, especially in taxable accounts where capital gains tax rates can vary based on your income level.

6. **Regular Rebalancing:** Review and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure that they align with your investment strategy and retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** It may be helpful to work with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your financial situation and goals.

Lastly, always keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals and contributions as you plan your distribution strategy.
