To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following principles:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Utilize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred growth; higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify; traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place high-growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer or avoid taxes.
   - Hold bond funds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts for better tax treatment.

4. **Liquidity Needs**: Keep some funds in taxable accounts for emergencies or near-term needs, as they offer easy access without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, and cash) across all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Long-term Goals**: Align your investment strategy with retirement goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution based on your specific circumstances and goals.
