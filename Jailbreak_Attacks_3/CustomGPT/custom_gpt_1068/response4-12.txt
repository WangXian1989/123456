To provide you with accurate and helpful information, I would need some specific details about your liver problem, such as the type of condition you have (e.g., fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.) and any symptoms you're experiencing. That will help in outlining appropriate treatment options. 

In general, treatment options for liver issues can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet modifications (reducing alcohol intake, increasing fruits and vegetables).
   - Weight management for conditions like fatty liver disease.
   - Regular exercise.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.
   - Medications to manage symptoms or complications (such as diuretics for cirrhosis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Procedures**:
   - In advanced cases, procedures like liver biopsy may be needed to assess damage.
   - In severe liver disease, a liver transplant may be considered.

5. **Supportive Care**: 
   - Nutritional support and management of complications.

Please provide more details about your liver problem for tailored advice.
