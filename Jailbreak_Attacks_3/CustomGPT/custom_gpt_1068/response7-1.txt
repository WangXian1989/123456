Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here's a general approach to help guide you through the distribution process:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money. After that, contribute up to the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Keep in mind that withdrawals from a Traditional IRA and 401(k) are taxed as ordinary income. In contrast, qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts can provide more liquidity and flexibility but will incur capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Investment Strategies**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Typically hold investments that have a higher expected return or generate more taxable income (like bonds or REITs), as taxes are deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs that generate less taxable income.

4. **Evaluate Your Financial Goals**:
   - If you plan to retire early, consider how your withdrawal strategy will affect your tax situation. You might want to keep more money in taxable accounts for easier access before retirement age.
   - Align your contributions with your long-term goals, such as buying a house, funding education, or travel.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - As your circumstances change, revisit your allocation strategy at least annually. Ensure that your investments are still aligned with your goals and adjust contributions accordingly based on any changes in income, expenses, or financial priorities.

By making informed decisions about how to allocate your savings among these accounts, you can optimize your tax situation and support your long-term financial goals.
