Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to meet any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if you can afford it, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions. The choice between the two depends on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

### 2. Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:
   - **Investments in a Taxable Account:** Utilize taxable accounts for assets that may have lower tax impacts, like ETFs or index funds, which typically distribute fewer taxable dividends compared to actively managed funds.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting:** Consider strategies such as tax-loss harvesting to offset gains and reduce taxable income.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Age and Retirement Timing:** Younger investors might prioritize growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement may shift focus to stable investments in taxable accounts for liquidity.
- **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan for a strategic withdrawal plan to minimize tax impacts during retirement.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies based on your individual circumstances.
