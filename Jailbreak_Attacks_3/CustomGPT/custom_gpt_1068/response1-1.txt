Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k). Your contributions might be tax-deductible, depending on your income and whether you have access to a retirement plan at work.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement (including earnings) are tax-free if certain conditions are met. This can be advantageous if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Diversification of Accounts**: Depending on your age and retirement goals, consider diversifying how much you allocate to each type of account. For example, you might prioritize retirement accounts (401(k), IRA) now, and then shift toward taxable accounts as you approach retirement to maintain liquidity.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maxed out retirement accounts, consider putting additional savings into taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties before retirement age.

5. **Adjust for Retirement Timeline**: 
   - If retirement is decades away, higher allocations to growth-oriented investments are usually advisable.
   - As you approach retirement, consider a more conservative allocation to preserve capital.

6. **Regularly Reevaluate Your Strategy**: Financial situations change, so it’s important to periodically review your asset allocation, especially after major life events or changes in financial goals.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of individual financial situations and how tax laws might change, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies and help optimize tax efficiency.

Remember, there's no one-size-fits-all approach, so tailor your distribution based on your unique circumstances.
