Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money" that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions:** Once you've secured the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Individual Retirement Account). Depending on your eligibility, you can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes on withdrawals) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals).

3. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions to these accounts reduce your taxable income for the year, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are taxed, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains in these accounts are taxed in the year they are realized. They can offer flexibility with withdrawals but may be subject to higher tax rates.

4. **Diversity and Balance:** It can be beneficial to maintain a diverse investment strategy across all three account types, considering asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Bucket Strategy:** You might consider a "bucket" strategy, where funds are allocated to different accounts based on when you expect to need them (short-term, mid-term, and long-term needs).

6. **Maintain Liquidity:** Ensure that you have enough money in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies. Avoid over-contributing to retirement accounts where penalties may apply for early withdrawals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, helping you optimize your allocations according to your retirement goals, risk tolerance, and tax circumstances.

Ultimately, the right distribution will depend on your individual goals and circumstances. Regularly reviewing and adjusting your strategy as your situation evolves is also crucial.
