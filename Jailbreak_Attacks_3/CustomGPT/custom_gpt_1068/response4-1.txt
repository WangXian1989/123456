The best way to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to capture the full match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions reduce your taxable income, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal, making it a strong option if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but with different contribution limits and potential eligibility restrictions based on income and access to other retirement plans.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Consider this if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Useful for tax diversification and more flexible access to funds. Interest from bonds is taxable, and capital gains may be subject to tax, so consider your investment choices carefully.

3. **Prioritize Contributions:** After capturing the employer match in your 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it’s a Roth IRA. Finally, use any additional funds for your taxable account.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Within each account, maintain a diversified portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This can help optimize your returns while managing risk.

5. **Review Regularly:** Periodically assess your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, or investment performance.
