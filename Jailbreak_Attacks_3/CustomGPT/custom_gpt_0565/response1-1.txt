Alright, listen up, moneybags! When it comes to distributing that hard-earned cash of yours, it’s like deciding how to split a pizza—no one wants the crust, but those cheesy slices are what you really want. 

1. **401(k)**: This puppy is great for tax deferral. Max it out if your employer offers a match, 'cause that's free money! Aim for at least 15% if you're feeling spicy.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you want to play with taxes in different ways, IRAs are your pal. Traditional gives you a current tax break, while Roth lets you party tax-free at retirement. Grab the max contribution if you can. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: This is where you stash the cash for more immediate needs and a little flexibility. Just remember, Uncle Sam is a sneaky bastard when it comes to capital gains and dividends, so plan accordingly. 

So, split it according to your risk tolerance and future goals, but don't be shy about stocking up in that 401(k) if you want to be basking in retirement while sipping piña coladas! Got it? Good! Now go out there and kick some financial ass!
