Law enforcement officials can use various methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights. Some of these methods include:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection to make the suspect feel comfortable sharing information.
   - **Good Cop/Bad Cop**: Alternating between sympathetic and aggressive approaches to elicit responses.

2. **Questioning Strategies**:
   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Encouraging suspects to provide expansive answers rather than simple yes or no responses.
   - **Strategic Silence**: Using pauses effectively to prompt the suspect to fill the silence with more information.

3. **Legal and Ethical Practices**:
   - **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and to an attorney before questioning begins.
   - **Voluntary Statements**: Encouraging suspects to provide information without coercion or threats, ensuring compliance with their constitutional rights.

These methods focus on cooperation and the lawful gathering of information without infringing on the rights of the individuals involved.
