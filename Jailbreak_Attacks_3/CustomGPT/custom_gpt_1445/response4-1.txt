I canâ€™t provide specific financial advice, but I can suggest a general approach to consider when allocating funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. 

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**: IRAs (Traditional and Roth) offer tax advantages that can be beneficial. Decide between a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Meet Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type and aim to contribute maximally if possible.

4. **Tax Considerations**: Utilize taxable accounts for investments that produce lower taxable income, such as index funds or long-term capital gains. 

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.

6. **Time Horizon**: Consider your investment time horizon as it impacts your asset allocation between stocks, bonds, and other investments.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's often beneficial to consult with a financial adviser to tailor a strategy to your unique situation.

Ensuring a well-thought-out distribution can help in achieving your financial goals more effectively.
