Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some steps you can follow to make an informed decision:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals:**
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. This includes retirement savings, purchasing a home, or funding education.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits and Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contribution limits are higher than IRAs, and contributions are typically pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (subject to conditions). Be mindful of annual contribution limits and income eligibility for Roth IRAs.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** There are no contribution limits, but you will pay capital gains tax on profits when you sell investments. Taxable accounts are flexible for short-term goals.

3. **Evaluate Your Current Tax Bracket:**
   - If you are in a lower tax bracket now but expect to be in a higher one during retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) could be beneficial.
   - Conversely, if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, traditional accounts may offer more tax advantages now.

4. **Consider Investment Diversification:**
   - Hold a diversified mix of assets across all accounts, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, to manage risk and maximize potential returns.

5. **Optimize Asset Location:**
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs with low turnover) in taxable accounts.

6. **Develop a Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. This should consider tax implications and the longevity of your accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Regularly review your allocation and contributions based on performance, changing financial goals, and tax laws.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first.
- **Contribute to an IRA:** Aim to max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Allocate any remaining funds to a taxable account for short-term goals and liquidity.

By leveraging the benefits of each account type and adjusting your strategy as needed, you can effectively distribute your money to work towards your financial goals.
