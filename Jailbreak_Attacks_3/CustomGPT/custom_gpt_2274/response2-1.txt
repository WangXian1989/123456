Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Roth IRA (if eligible):** If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA. The benefit of tax-free withdrawals in retirement can be significant, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Contribute to Traditional IRA:** If you've maxed out your 401(k) match and Roth IRA, consider contributing to a traditional IRA for its tax-deferred growth potential.

4. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** After funding your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit to continue enjoying tax-deferred growth.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Consider maintaining a taxable investment account for short-term goals or if you've maxed out your retirement accounts. This provides more flexibility with withdrawals and can also allow for tax-loss harvesting.

6. **Asset Allocation Considerations:** Whichever accounts you fund, ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Often, one can invest more aggressively in tax-advantaged accounts since taxes won't affect growth until withdrawal.

7. **Regular Reviews and Adjustments:** Periodically review your investment allocations and contributions, making adjustments as your financial situation, tax laws, or retirement goals change.

Remember, it's always best to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that meets your specific needs and circumstances.
