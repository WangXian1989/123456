Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for optimizing your retirement savings and tax efficiency. Hereâ€™s a basic strategy:

### 1. Understand Account Types:
- **401(k):** Tax-deferred, often with employer matching. Lower tax rates upon withdrawal.
- **IRA:** Also tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth). Contribution limits apply.
- **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but offers flexibility and access to funds.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions:
1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
2. **IRA:** Consider funding a Roth IRA if eligible, or a Traditional IRA if you need tax deductions.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use for extra savings beyond retirement accounts or for short-term goals.

### 3. Asset Allocation:
- Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds).
- Keep more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

### 4. Regular Rebalancing:
- Review your allocations annually to ensure they align with your goals and market performance.

### 5. Consider Tax Implications:
- Assess your current and projected future tax rates to decide between Roth (tax-free later) vs. Traditional (tax-deferred).

This strategy helps maximize growth while minimizing taxes over time. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
