When distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize any employer match first as it's essentially free money. Aim to contribute enough to reach the maximum limit if your budget allows.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, utilize taxable accounts. Invest in low-turnover index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) and sectors to mitigate risk.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a liquidity buffer separate from these accounts to cover unexpected expenses, ideally covering 3-6 months of living expenses.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your distribution plan annually or when your financial situation changes.
