Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your age, risk tolerance, tax situation, and financial goals. Here’s a structured approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maxing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**: 
   - 401(k) and IRA accounts have annual contribution limits. Make sure you understand these limits to maximize your tax-deferred growth.

3. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **Taxable Account**: Funds in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax. It may be wise to place investments with high growth potential or high turnover in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Consider your investment strategy and time horizon. For long-term growth, you might place equity-heavy investments in retirement accounts, while more conservative investments can be held in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Periodically reassess your allocations to ensure your investment strategy aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: 
   - If unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation.

Finding the right balance is crucial for both growth and tax efficiency. Adjusting contributions based on your financial goals can lead to better long-term outcomes.
