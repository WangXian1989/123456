Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts grow tax-deferred. Prioritize maxing out contributions to these accounts before taxable accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income (like bonds) or for funds you might need before retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all your accounts to balance risk.

4. **Age Considerations**: If you’re younger, you might lean more towards growth investments. As you approach retirement, consider shifting to more conservative investments.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan ahead for how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it’s often beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA) to manage tax liabilities effectively.

6. **Regular Review**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on market performance and changes in your personal situation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a plan tailored to your specific circumstances.
