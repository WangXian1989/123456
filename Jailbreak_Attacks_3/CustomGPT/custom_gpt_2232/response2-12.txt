I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver issues can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Improving diet, reducing alcohol consumption, and maintaining a healthy weight.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, doctors might prescribe medications to reduce inflammation or manage symptoms.
3. **Nutritional Support**: A dietitian can help create a meal plan that supports liver health.
4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to track progress.
5. **Specialist Referrals**: Consulting a hepatologist for advanced treatment options if the condition is severe.

It's essential to discuss your specific situation with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
