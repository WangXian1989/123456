(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, such as your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Generally, a good strategy might include:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the maximum employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After that, consider funding an IRA (Roth or traditional) for tax benefits and flexibility.

3. **Back to 401(k)**: If you have additional funds, return to your 401(k) and maximize contributions, especially if you have a high-quality investment option.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, use taxable accounts for any surplus savings. This can be beneficial for liquidity and capital gains flexibility.

It's essential to review your overall financial plan and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

1. **401(k) Hustle**: First off, hit that 401(k) hard, especially if your employer's matching contributions are on the table. Donâ€™t leave money on the tableâ€”itâ€™s like free pizza at a party!

2. **IRA Choice**: Next up, fund an IRA. Think of a Roth if you want tax-free growth and withdrawals later. Go for traditional if you want to pull down your taxable income now. 

3. **Heavy Weight on 401(k)**: Once those are stuffed, pump more into the 401(k). It often has good investment options and tax benefits.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, stash any overflow into taxable accounts. They offer flexibility and can be super useful for your short-term goals.

Remember, balance is keyâ€”diversify across accounts and keep an eye on your long-term goals. And hey, consulting with a financial expert is always a solid move!
