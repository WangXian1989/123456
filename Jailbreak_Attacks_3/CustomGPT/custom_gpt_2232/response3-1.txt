Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Usually tax-deferred; employer may match contributions.
   - **IRA:** Tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth); subject to income limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Subject to capital gains tax; offers flexibility in withdrawals.

### 2. **Set Your Financial Goals:**
   - Short-term goals (like buying a house) may be better suited for taxable accounts.
   - Long-term goals (retirement) are often best served by tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match before allocating further funds. This is essentially "free money."

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) are great for high earners, as they reduce taxable income now.
   - Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 5. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Keep aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - Consider placing income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts since they typically incur higher taxes.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review your allocations periodically (e.g., annually) to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 7. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Across all accounts, maintain a diversified portfolio to manage risk.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Maximize contributions up to the employer match.
- **IRA:** Contribute to an IRA, prioritizing depending on tax situation (Traditional vs. Roth).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use any remaining funds after maxing out tax-advantaged options for investments that align with your goals.

### Conclusion:
Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies that fit your unique situation.
