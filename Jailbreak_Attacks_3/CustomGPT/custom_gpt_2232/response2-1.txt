Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA (either Traditional or Roth) next, depending on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This helps you reduce your taxable income and benefit from potential growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have reached the limits for tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you’re diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in a savings account or money market fund, typically 3-6 months’ worth of living expenses.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
