Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match; this is essentially free money.
   - Max out contributions if possible, as they offer tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider maxing out an IRA (Traditional or Roth) after your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth if you're eligible based on income.
   - Diversifying tax treatments (tax-deferred vs. tax-free) can provide flexibility in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than regular income.
   - These funds can be accessed any time without penalties, making them useful for short- to medium-term goals.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Generally, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first, then focus on taxable accounts for any remaining savings.
   - Assess your expected tax bracket in retirement to optimize withdrawals.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk.
   - Be mindful of each account's specific investment choices, such as choosing more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts.

6. **Review Periodically**:
   - Regularly review your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
